## Project Summary

Using the BeautifulSoup4 webscraper, we collected data on the AO3 General Audiences Star Wars Fandom Stories. We used the Number of Hits as a way to determine story and author popularity. We analyzed the relationships author average post ratings had with their post frequency, story tags, characters and pairings, and story structure. Upon completion of our analysis, we recommend the following to Alice:

1. Post frequently (â‰¥ 1 story/month)
2. Write longer stories (> 4000 words)
3. Write stories that include Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, The Mandalorian & Grogu (Baby Yoda), Mace Windu (Important Characters from The Mandalorian and the Clone Wars series)
4. Consider exploring stories about time-travel in the Star Wars Universe
