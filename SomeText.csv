Chapter Text
The young woman leaned back in the saddle, took a deep breath of arctic air, and sang. It was not the kind of song where words were important, more the sounds and tone and volume. She was singing because she was happy. It was almost time for the spring migration, her favorite time of year and she was glad to be underway.Her companions appreciated her song in their quiet way. They appreciated her company in their quiet way as well. It was a great sign of respect that they allowed her, an off-worlder, to develop her own song and sing in their cultural style. For many that was a first. There might be another tribe who had accepted in an off-worlder, but Hazal Ahu-Aptal hadn’t met any. Her tribe didn’t call her Hazal very often. They called her Lichen. This was both a term of endearment due to her pale mint-green skin as well as a sign of their respect for her. Their herd needed lichen to survive. It was a particular Pantoran trait to mix a sign of respect with a bit of humor.The herd appreciated her song as well. They were all domesticated and didn’t spook at humanoid contact or noises. The young woman could sense her own mount was particularly calmed. Hazal had an easier time sensing the emotional state of the big animals than with sentient beings. She’d been living with generations of these reindeer (or rangifer as her the herders called them) for the better part of seven years and had become quite attuned to them. They were glorious animals, big enough to ride. Their shoulders were almost even with her own and she was tall for a Mirialan. She had named her mount Taran. The animals were everything to the Pantoran reindeer herders. They assisted in the calving. They rode with them. The reindeer pulled their sledges. They ate their meat. They wore their hides along with woven wool clothing. They spent as much time with them as possible. And they sold them off for their only source of income.The reindeer were the reason the tribe had been so accepting of the young woman. She came to them at a time of crisis when an epidemic had struck the herd. She used her scientific and animal husbandry knowledge to stem and banish the illnesses. Then she decided to stay and continue her studies. It had been easy to welcome to an outsider with such valuable talents. Sure, some had been unsettled at first. Her green skin reminded them of a corpse. They had tales of the Drowned Goddess having undead consorts of such pallor. The elders despaired that she would be unable to find a spouse with such coloration. Plus, she’s so tall and lanky unlike their local beauty standards. She was amused when she found out about this gossip since she did not expect to ever get married at all. The younger, more worldly ones reminded the elders that her complexion was normal from whatever planet she came from. It wasn’t like most of them hadn’t seen an alien before. The Republic held multitudes of sentient species. But their people only knew the artic and subarctic of their moon. The tundra and the taiga. How they fluctuate with the seasons. The ebb and flow of migration. Hazal knew most people would call it a simple life. It actually contained great detail and nuance once you put in the time and she loved learning about it. And she loved that they had accepted her in. It was the only time in her life that she felt truly accepted into a community. The less she thought about the Temple the better. She always felt like she was starting off on the wrong foot there.The only thing that marred the joy she felt during the spring migration had to do with the Temple. She had to stop by Solitary Outpost to use their commlink every time she passed though. It was her one lifeline to the Jedi Order and her twice yearly reminder of her lowly status within it. With the tribe even though she was a welcome outsider she felt powerful with them. In her element. Ascended to her area of expertise. With the Jedi she was a washout, a lowly masterless AgriCorps laborer. So, the Outpost and its communications system was the one bitter stop on this glorious journey to the springtime grazing fields and the rituals of yearly calving. Oh, and that silly girl. Her family were owner-operators of the Outpost and she always pestered Hazal with enthusiastic questions. She wished she would just leave her alone so she could get her business done and get back to her tribe and the herd. That girl was downright weird.That was in a few days. She’d deal with the commlink, her messages, her updates, and the girl when that time came upon her. Better to live in the moment and enjoy the morning air and her song. Taran’s warm bulk and loping steady gate were such a reassurance to her. If the Agricultural Corps chose to reassign her, she would just quit and stay. That’s all there was to it, this was the life for her. This is how she would serve the Living Force. With her tribe and her herd. It was the only lifestyle she wanted.  The young woman was bored and stressed. Slumped in her chair at the Solitary Outpost’s cashier station with her chin in one hand she studied the holo diagram projected before her. Meita Chiran readjusted the glasses that supposedly help with holo and screen glare and gestured to explode the image outward for more detail. These correspondence technical college courses were the one chance she had to escape working here her entire life and in private moments she was afraid she had reached the limits of her minds’ ability to comprehend. Sure, she was good with hardware, she could fix just about anything. But anything in the little town of Solitary, the last beachhead of urban life on the edge of the arctic, was nothing like what was out there in actual cities. She was having trouble figuring out how a scomp link worked.She closed her lesson plans out of frustration and pulled up the holo message boards. Time to catch up on news about the war, news about the Jedi. She was a member of about a dozen Jedi related boards and moderator of two. They were amazing. It was a pity there were no prominent Pantoran Jedi out there. How great would that be? Absolute heroes, ineffable mystical powers, plus they were the generals saving us from the Separatist menace on top of everything. She flicked though dozens of videos amateur reporters posted of the Jedi doing their thing on the battlefield. Absolutely amazing. For Light and Life. Her mood was lifted up. Meita looked over at the public commlink terminal in the corner of the shop. It was the closest communication device of its kind for many kilometers around and few people had portable satellite technology in this neck of the taiga. She smiled. Her favorite time of year was coming up. The most prestigious board she frequented was reserved for posting user’s personal interaction with Jedi. Meita was lucky enough that she actually knew one, and she was coming by in a few days. She had been writing and erasing her list of questions and conversation points for weeks now. Just to be in the presence of one of those beings made her so elated. Meita closes the boards and pulls up a map with the satellite data of Hazal Ahu-Aptal’s herd highlighted. They were just days away. It was like waiting for the Festival of the Moon Goddess for Meita. The waiting was unbearable, but the excitement helped her get though the day. The drudgery of being a shopgirl. That was not the life she wanted. To live like a Jedi, that would be something else entirely.   




Notes:

I'm writing this because I was curious if anyone would read a fic with all original characters, and I had this idea for a Jedi Service Corps after Order 66. We always follow these larger-than-life figures as they blaze a trail across the Galaxy but what about the hapless dropouts. Just two girls out of their depth scrambling around.This will be a light comedy with some melodrama and maybe slow burn romance?If I break my OC rule it would be to toss in Tepoh because that would amuse me if the one canon character was such a minor one and I've got to maintain my cred as the top Tepoh creator on Ao3.Pantoran culture in this fic was greatly inspired by the works of ArtyWrites, Across the Frozen Sea and Launch Date. They write great stuff, I highly recommend looking up their work.I really think there would be in-Universe Jedi Order stans and simps and they would be all over the holonet.

Chapter Text
 Outside her tent the shamans are drumming to wake up the stragglers still clinging to sleep. Inside her tent Hazal is already well awake.  She is sitting on the skins lining the floor preparing some test tubes. Two of her oldest friends, Cheppa and Erro, enter through the door flap. They go through the familiar steps of slipping off their thick mittens and uniting earflaps to remove their hats. The last step is shedding their outer layers as to enjoy the relative warmth of the tent with its sputtering brazier. Erro rubs his hands together and rubs his beard to get the frost to thaw.“Hey, Lichen.” These two are working up to something, Hazal thinks. She can dimly sense their emotional reticence. “Why don’t you put those down and help us with the pancakes? We can help you test soil samples after breakfast.”“Sure thing.”Hazal smiles and relents. These two had temporarily left the tribe for some formal education in the towns so they were well able to help prepare her samples. The fact that they left and came back to share their education with the tribe particularly earned her respect. She nips outside to get a cooler and upon returning takes a slim little knife to slice off a few layers of the frozen reindeer blood. It took her quite a while to get used to blood pancakes, but they were an excellent source of protein at the start of your day.Her blue-skinned friends share a look before getting down to business. Hazal just adored the two of them. They weren’t siblings but decided when they were children to mutually wear family colors as a sign of their friendship.When the liquid ingredients were melting away over the hearth and the dry ingredients were properly measured out, they made their case.“Erro and I were thinking. This is such a happy time of year. The sun returning, the migration to the summer pastures. But we can tell it’s hard for you to stop at the Outpost.”Erro nods. “We thought it would be better if you just didn’t contact your Temple. Maybe it’s time to let them go and not have worry about their approval? They only let you down. They don’t appreciate you.”“Just ghost them. You don’t need that hassle.”Hazal sighs and looks over at her battered decade-out-of-date datapad.“Believe me, I think about it twice a year, but then no one would see my work.”Cheppa shrugs. “Submit your findings to some scientific journals. It would take a few days to find an interested publisher. You’d have to stay behind and deal with, you know. Her. But it might pay off for you.  The fruits of your labor would find a galactic audience.”“I appreciate the concern, but on some level, I have a duty to fulfill. Maybe I’ll start in the autumn, but I’ve finally got a final draft for one of my longitudinal studies and I should upload it to the archives.”Cheppa slides a generous dab of butter into her frying pan generating a terrific sizzling noise. “Alright. Just know that we are here for you.”“I appreciate it, thank you.”With that confrontation behind them they continue with the mundane ritual of preparing breakfast. They gossiped a bit, which is also an activity so ingrained it might as well be ritual. Hazal pops a corner of the first pancake into her mouth to test the flavor and consistency. They begin an assembly line of plastoid serving trays piled with pancakes, tins of preserved fruit spread, and servings of dried meat and pickled vegetables. Maybe she wouldn’t worry about her soil samples today. Maybe she should go out and check on her mount instead. Riding Taran around the perimeter of the heard always helped settle her feelings. Plus, would be comforting to check the rest of the animals for injury or illness.  She focused on the moment and went out to share a morning meal with her community. The tribe ensures everyone will be fed. Gossip ensures everyone’s needs are known even if they might not want their business in people’s mouths. When people’s needs are known and addressed then everyone is valued, and the tribe as a whole is stronger. It works for the rangifer, why wouldn’t it work for the Pantorans and their Mirialan outlier?  Meita carefully threaded power and data cords from one machine to the other. The migration was starting. This was one of the two times a year her little hamlet came alive. Her family made most of their sales during these times. As usual her mother asked her to get the three extra registers out of storage so there would be less wait time for the increased volume of customers. Her cousins would soon be coming into town to work these registers. That means less privacy. That means judgement over all her weird hobbies. It means putting the more cringy fanart on her walls in safe keeping. The annual migrations were a mixed bag in Meita’s judgement.Her mother completes restocking and inventory along the far wall and strides over. They make sure to have extra goods on hand. Some of the tribes like to indulge in trade goods that they cannot make themselves and they all needed tools to survive this far north that cannot me made out of wood, furs, horn, and bone. A lot of the extras the family purchases on credit which they can hopefully afford to pay back after tribes all come though. It is a bi-annual gamble so tensions run high in the Chiran household.“How is it coming along, dear?”“Good, mom. These things are getting pretty old. When can we upgrade to the same model as our usual register?”“Maybe when the war is over, we’ll get some tourist money. This used to be a popular pathfinding spot when I was young. We’d get more Snow Walkers coming though in the Summer in peacetime.”Meita was not looking forward to that last possibility. The drugged up religious pilgrims were the worst customers. “These will definitely last another spring and autumn. Can’t make too many promises beyond then.”Her mother gives her one of those looks. “If you progress in your studies, I am certain you will find better ways to fix and upgrade them.”The message was pretty clear. We’re making an investment in your education that we could be putting directly into the family business, so Meita had better buckle down so she can pay that back tenfold.“Yes, mother. As long as this hardware holds out. Might have to make a trip to Persistence for fresh circuit boards if this one overheats again.”“In this weather? We can just take that one outside for a bit. Have you cleaned up your room?”“Pretty much.”“It had better be ready for company by tomorrow. And I need you on best behavior. Your cousins really are a big help during the rush.”“Yes mother.” Meita wanted nothing more but to abandon these elderly machines and ride out on her speeder bike.  Hell with the rush. She takes a breath and counts to ten and remembers Jedi Master Ahu-Aptal will soon be here. That makes all the hassle of migration more than worth it. She once more played over her ideal interview in her mind's eye while she continued to hook up the elderly machines and bring them back to life.Just a few more days. 




Notes:

Okay, so. I cheated and jumped the gun on the first chapter but I'm hoping to have this be my NaNoWriMo effort this year. I will be posting regularly and just a warning by nature this will be a rambling, no Beta, just going whichever way fic. If that appeals to you pull up a seat.Inspiration for a tribe of Pantoran reindeer headers came from a brief bit in the excellent fic Across the Frozen Sea by ArtyWrites. There's some great Pantoran world building in there and I recommend a read. I took further inspiration from the real-like Sami people of Scandanavia such as the general manner of dress and the blood pancakes; iagl they sound kind of grub.

Chapter Text
Today was the day. They’d make Solitary by nightfall. In her tent surrounded by her packed belongings Hazal ate her breakfast of toasted oats, dried berries, and a thick yogurt. Like most of her meals it was a mixture of what was fed to the herd and the product they produced from that feed. Afterwards she began disassembling her dwelling and loading up her sledge. The sledge was made of modern metallic alloys, this might be one of the more traditional tribes but even they didn’t shun every technology that made their lifestyle easier just as they accepted her formal veterinary education. It was the spirit of heritage that was important to them rather than every detail.She was a little worried that the herd might be a little restless as Ordo Plutonia was waxing three-quarters last night and the light cloudcover created quite a lot of planetlight. Many had taken the opportunity to wake in the small hours and do some grazing so they might be overly tired and restless today.All around her the Pantoran hounds were being chased around by laughing children. They were too young for the labor of packing up so they would soon be ordering the hounds to gather up the herd. She didn’t speak with her friends this morning. Everyone was too engaged in pulling their own weight to ensure they wouldn’t be the one to hold the group behind schedule. Some of the adults had already strapped skis to their curl-toed fur boots and were moving cargo around on their own sledges attached to their belts. They used one long ski pole pushing them into the ground on one side, then the other like gondola pilots.One last check on her saddlebags then she prepared Taran with his yolk, saddle, and reins. She gave him some affectionate scratches on his snout and cheeks. Then she mounted up and gave him the whistle embark to the southeast.   Meita refreshed the satellite positioning of the herd. Doing some quick arithmetic on her head she estimated a late afternoon arrival. She thought about maybe changing shifts with one of her brothers. Maybe it would be best to work the whole day just in case. It’s not like they didn’t need the extra help. Master Ahu-Aptal’s group wasn’t the only one coming through today. Best to be there the entire day just to be sure. She was already pressed and dressed and ready to go.  “There you go, bud. Happy to get out of that thing? Let us get this over with.” Hazal delighted in her mount’s satisfaction of a day’s travel done. The heard was safely secured in one of the huge pens surrounding the village of Solitary. The sun was low and orange in the sky. Families were sending their runners down to the Outpost with their shopping lists and calls for maybe a treat. No more putting it off. It was time for the AgriCorps worker to check in.  Hazal entered the Outpost announced by the door chime. She removed her mittens, untied the earflaps of her hat, and tucked all three into her belt.Meita beamed. “Good afternoon, Master Jedi. Welcome.”“Still not a Master, barely a Jedi. Good afternoon to you.” She made her way right to the public commlink kiosk.Meita for her part turned her attention (part of it anyway) back to her current customer. Sure, her heart was thumping in her chest, but the Jedi would be here for a while. She would have her time.Hezal slid her old reliable datapad out from its satchel. She’d had it all her career. It still had the Jedi youngling emblem imprinted on the back though the emblem was a bit scratched with wear. Durable, solar powered, but it was not equipped with any wireless transmission hardware to maximize memory storage. She fished a cable out to connect with the Holonet. This was it.
Inbox: 0/0 Unread Messages
She scrunches up her eyes. Half a year and NO messages? Not even the newsletters and Reply All announcements? The Service Corps had as good as abandoned her. Maybe it was sabotage? Maybe that horrid know-it-all Barriss had taken her off the network? She’d do anything to keep Master Unduli from picking Hazal over herself.No, she had to face facts. Leaning on jealousy and mistruths would only lead to the dark side. She was passed over due to her lack of connection, talent, and finesse with the Force, and it would have been right and good for the Jedi as a whole for another Mirialan to apprentice with Luminara Unduli. Hazal knew she was right where she was supposed to be. Where she was destined to be. She began uploading all the outstanding weekly progress reports, the monthly self-ratings, and the final draft of her research paper Studies on Microbiology in Cold Weather Climates with Special Regard to their Effect on Parasitology of Pantoran Lifestock. That was that. She had no other business here. She didn’t care about the news. She didn’t care about the war. She had no personal calls to make as everyone she cared about was right here.Somehow that silly girl knew exactly how long she would take because she was right outside.“May I interest you in any of our wares?”“No thanks, I think I have what I need.”“Do you have some time for a few questions?”“I guess I have some time.” Here it comes.“Did you ever train with Masters Kloon or Windu?” The Plo girlies on the boards were ravenous for stories.“From time to time.”“What were they like?”“Master Kloon found as much time as he could to go down and tutor younglings. He was always patient but made good sure we took away the intended lesson from whatever the instruction might be. Seemed to know all of our names. Master Windu was just awe inspiring. You could really sense his raw potential at all times but we were never close. He was always very busy with Council business. He’d always officiate important events and meetings.”“What are your opinions on full sentient rights for clones?”“I’ve never met or seen a clone. Are they sentient? If so, and if they live in the Republic, they should get full rights. That doesn’t seem all that hard.”“Do you feel there should be a clone resettlement program after the war?”“Beings must go somewhere. I’m afraid I don’t know enough on the military to speculate. I hope the Service Corps help out, whatever happens.”There was so much more Meita wanted to ask: if she thought the war was ending, if she’d ever used a mind trick, her opinions on SO many other Jedi figures of our current age and before but she also knew Hazal had her limits.“Thank you for your patience, Master Jedi. Be well, enjoy the migration, and may the Force be with you.”“Once more, not a Master. May the Force be with you.” The AgriCorps worker made her way to the door and stopped to take a deep breath of clean, cold air. The hard part was over and she could center herself.Inside Meita put a hand to her heart and sighed. Such an amazing person. She couldn’t wait to upload her covert footage.




Notes:

If you live on a moon then you get planetlight and not moonlight, right?Meita would have loved to ask a few dozen questions on the Wolfpack but knew she'd get no answers.

Chapter Text
            The following afternoon cataclysmic events were playing out across the Galaxy. The Chosen One betrayed his people for the promise of safety for his wife. He pledged himself as apprentice to a Dark Lord. A message was sent out to the Grand Army of the Republic sealing the fate for the Jedi Order. Jedi and force sensitives all over the Galaxy felt the echo of this tragedy. Some were absolutely overcome with grief and anguish.             While riding her mount back in the Levona Province of Pantora near the moon’s Arctic Circle Jedi AgriCorps worker Hazal Ahu-Aptal experienced it as slight stomach pains. She was curious as to the cause; She wasn’t near that stage her menstrual cycle. It couldn’t be what she ate. Besides, a bad meal didn’t usually accompany a slight sense of doom. Taran huffed and tried his best to look back at his rider. She scratched his mane and went about her evening.              After closing up at the Outpost Meita grabbed the dustpan and broom and tried her best to sweep up. They’d have to mop afterwards as well, so many people had tracked slush all over the shop floor. They really should get a droid for this.            The public commlink kiosk suddenly chimed and a cheery automated voice declared a Republic-wide public announcement was incoming. One of the holoprojectors swung free of its housing and projected the speaker’s platform from the Galactic Senate.            “Citizens of the civilized Galaxy, on this day we mark a transition.”            Meita gawked wide-eyed at the announcement. The entire war was some sort of false flag? A coup?            “The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated! Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.”            Her broom clattered to the ground as she held her hands to her mouth. No, no. This can’t be happening. She looked behind her and her family members had similar shocked expressions. Her mother looked over at her with pity. When the self-proclaimed Emperor got to the part about citizens being the eyes of the New Order and reporting insurrectionists, she couldn’t take it anymore and fled to her room. She retrieved her workstation and went right to the boards. There she found horrid confirmation. Her fellow Jedi watchers compiled news clips from the front. The Jedi generals did not seem like they were about to seize power in a coup. It looked more like they were getting shot in the back for most of them. She switched over to see what The Galactic Wave was broadcasting. Den Dhur was reporting from the Temple District in Courscant, it was full night over there. The Jedi Temple was on fire. Den was exasperated and saying something but the words wouldn’t register in her mind.            She switched back to the boards. She started putting out queries, what about the Service Corps? Surely they wouldn’t be part of this so-called conspiracy? She posted over and over. Scanned and scrolled. Oh no, there it was. A local reporter from Hetzal Prime was taking an interview with an AgriCorps team leader on the Rooted Moon where they had been sent to stamp out a strain of leaf rot. The friendly banter was interrupted when the man received a lethal blaster bolt though his chest. The reporter screamed and the camera panned over to a squad of clones calmly firing down on the group. Only a few managed to turn and attempt to run. None were armed. They were not successful.  Meita felt numb with fear. Moderators of the various boards began to suggest that maybe maintaining these boards could be dangerous, seditious, and perhaps even harmful to the very Jedi they admire because they kept such close track of the movements of their heroes. One by one they shut down. Fan chatter shifted over to services on password protected private servers. You know, where they kept the good stuff. The really spicy Stellan/Geode RPF.            Meita could always log in to them later, she had all the passwords memorized. Right now, she had to break out of her catatonia and do something. She started to pack her things.            Her mother came in her room without asking. “Honey, are you okay? It’s been hours. What are you doing?”            “I’ve got to get out of here, mom.”            “And do what?”            “Something! I can’t just sit here and watch the news. I need to be going somewhere. I need to be active. I’m sorry, I know it’s our rush season, but you have my brothers and cousins. I’ll keep up with my courses, I promise.”            “You’ve really got to go?”            “Yes. I’m an adult, I’ve got to get out there and see what sense I can make of things. It’s my right.”            Her mother smooths down her daughter’s straw blond hair which had become quite haphazard.            “I guess you wouldn’t be a Chiran if you didn’t follow your heart. Go to her. We’ll make do here.”            Meita gave her a nod and reached for her parka. Overloaded with her bags she stormed past her other relatives and went right to her beat up old speeder bike which she inherited from her father. She tossed the bags into a repulsor-sled which she hooked to the bike’s rear hitch. She slid on her helmet. Her last-minute check had Hazal’s herd just a few klicks to the southeast. She gunned the engine and roared over the treetops into the night. 




Notes:

Meita is truly one of us.










Chapter 5





Chapter Text
            Meita landed her speeder once she spotted the bonfires. Many rangifer herders utilized bikes and air speeders to heard but this tribe held to the traditional ways. She didn’t want to spook the animals with engine noise. She pinned a flashlight to her jacket and went stomping though the slushy snow in what she hoped was the correct general direction. She wove her way past trunks of evergreen trees. Soon there were the animals resting all around her.            “Hazal! Where is Hazal? I need to speak with her!”            She burst into a clearing and there were the tents and fires with Pantorans like herself milling about. She accosted one and had to catch her breath before again making her intensions clear.            A tribe such as this one had not chieftain or central leadership, instead they chose two elders for settling disputes, a man and woman who are not married to each other from the two most prominent families. Sometimes they chose only one of a blended nature which was seen as auspicious as the Trickster Goddex was unlikely to suffer random misfortune upon the tribe if they saw the tribe valued leadership from one like themselves. Meita found herself brought before High Elder Pazaeta.            “What do you want at such a late hour, silly town girl?”Pazaeta called all the town folk silly because that is how they viewed their lifestyle. It was actually a step up from other tribes who often found themselves in dispute with urban Pantorans who didn’t consider them much before building a hydroelectric damn that would flood ancestral pasture lands and drown sacred landmarks. There had been a few tense sit-in protests in the recent past.“I need to speak with Hazal, is she still traveling with you?” Meita looked all around attempting to spot her.“Cheppa, go find Lichen for us.”A few minutes later her friend leads Hazal out to the clearing. She slides off her mount and looks Meita up and down.“What are you doing here?”“Hazal, the war is over.”“Oh? Good.”“Not good for you. Palpatine has declared himself Emperor and he claims the Jedi tried to oust him in a coup. He says the Separatist movement was a Jedi plot to take over the Republic. Your people are all being hunted down, Hazal. Enemies of the state.”She blinked. The Jedi were being hunted down? ‘My people’? Her actual people were right here all around her. Still, she felt tug on her ties to the past. For the Jedi to be called enemies of the state was unthinkable.“Impossible.”“I’ve seen it. It’s happening all over. The clones turned on them.”“I’m just AgriCorps, no one would care about me.”“No. The Service Corps were not excluded. You must come with me. I’ll take you someplace safe.”“I’m safe right here.”“No, you’re not, Hazal. And if you’re here they aren’t safe either. Please. I beg you.”“Why do you care? You hardly know me.”“I know you are Jedi, no matter your rank. All the Jedi do is help people. You’ve helped this tribe. You’re all so powerful and selfless. You give and give with no thought towards reward. You’ve given your lives over to the Republic for generations. Now you are in danger. I suspect I annoy you to no end, but I want to help you. If I could just save one of you it would be a blessing. Please. Let me take you to safety.”Pazadeta turns to the Jedi. “What do you think, Lichen? This silly town girl says there is danger, and we wouldn’t want you to come to harm. We would feel sadness if you left but that would be outweighed by grief if you were gone for good.”“I’ve been here nearly half my life. I don’t know or care for much else at this point.”Meita shrugs. “I’m sure you can come back once the danger has passed.”“I-I can take Taran and ride off.” She pats the animal’s side.“How do you think I found you. The herd has tracking chips implanted. Even if you removed it how many green girls are out here riding rangifer? Hazal, please.”She gives her best pleading look with her big golden eyes. Hazal studies the intensity of her expression. Like a lot of settled Pantorans she had facial tattoos representing familial heritage. Hers were short golden lines radiating from under her eyes down to her jaw. Combined with her rounded cheeks they made her look a little like a tooka. She’d never taken Meita seriously before but there was no mistaking how serious she was in this moment.The Jedi takes a deep breath and nods.“Do you have anything on you that can be tracked or can be identified with you? If so we must get rid of it.”Hazal thinks for a moment and slides her datapad out of her satchel. Meita goes to take it from her, she instinctively jerks it away.“This is my life’s work. I can’t just toss it in a ditch.”Erro walks over to them. “Let me take it. You can have it back when times are less fraught.”Reluctantly she passes it over.It doesn’t take long to pack her things. It does take a while to say goodbye to the people and finally her reindeer who needs to be held back by the reins so the two women can depart the encampment. Hazal feels a sorrow as biting as the winter winds.After stowing her gear Hazal takes a seat behind the shopgirl. She looks over her shoulder one last time and bids them goodbye. Donning Meita’s spare helmet she braces herself for sudden acceleration.But nothing happens.“What’s wrong? You implied there were clones on their way to execute me, why are we sitting here?”There is a pause.“Ahhh. I don’t know what to do!”“You convinced me to go on the run with you, and you had absolutely no plans on how to do it?”“Yeah?”“Stilly Town Girl!”“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, this is as far I got in my planning! I was just operating off instinct!”“I don’t know the extent of the danger. Help me out. What would we need to do?”“Hide from clone forces, government officials, don’t leave a paper trail.”“We should go south to one of the larger cities where there are more off-worlders. I’ll stand out less.”“Yeah!” Meita jerks her head up which causes her helmet to clunk off her passenger’s helmet. “We’ll go to Persistence! It will take a day or two.”“Do you know anyone there?”“My uncles’ ex-boyfriend! He would put us up for a while.”“Do you trust this… uncle’s ex-boyfriend?”“Yeah, he loves me. He’s my favorite nearly-uncle-in-law.”Hazal feels like she is in freefall. Truly it was the work of the Trickster Goddex to warn her of the certain doom all around her but have the instrument of deliverance be completely clueless as what to do.“Fly on I guess, Meita. It’s Meita, right?”“Yes, you got it.”With a thrum of its engine the bike cut through the night air.

Chapter Text
It ended up taking far more than a day or two to get to Persistence. They flew all night then set up Hazal’s fabric and collapsible metal framed tent when they were both too tired to pilot the craft. Meita felt it was safer to travel exclusively by night anyhow. The Jedi would wait in the woods when she needed to go into the small towns spread across the northern reaches for fuel.In the quiet moments before they tried to get some sleep Meita tried to convince Hazal that things would work out, that Dr. Chenik owned a veterinarian practice in the city, so maybe he could give her some work while they were in hiding. Hazal felt it was prudent to be polite to her savior, so she didn’t point out the wide gulf between small animal veterinary practice and animal husbandry. Truth be told she had the training for both if not the specialty.The weather grew warmer as they made their way south. Hazal changed into her summer riding breeches, soft leather shoes, and wool tunic. With a pair of gloves and the speeder helmet no one else would know she wasn’t Pantoran. They flew more cautiously upon reaching the outskirts of the city. The clone garrison that the Republic stationed on the moon was located in the capital, Defiance, but there was sense in being cautious.It was well past nightfall when they reached their destination, a picturesque block of townhomes in a northeast neighborhood of the city.“We’ll park in the alley. I’ll knock on the kitchen door in the rear of the building.”Hazal thought Yeah, that will foil the might of this new Empire and all its battle-hardened clone soldiers, sneaking back behind the alley but she kept it to herself.Meita wrapped at the back door and after an uncomfortable wait it was answered by a middle-aged Pantoran man with short, buzzed hair and a well-trimmed lavender beard that only did a passable job camouflaging his slight double chin. He was the sort of big bear of a man who also radiated a gentle demeanor that likely endeared him to nervous domesticated pets in need of care.“Oh, Meita. What a surprise. It’s been a while. Do you need to get in touch with your uncle?”“Do you mind inviting us in, Doctor Chenik?” Meita attempted a friendly smile, natural for a long-time family friend coming for a casual visit, but it looked to Hazal more like a nervous grimace.“Of course, you and your friend are always welcome.”Once inside Hazal removed the bulky helmet and shook out her hair. The vet ushered them into his living room and bade them to take a seat on his couch.“Do you two need any refreshments?”“We should really talk with you first, it’s important.” Meita fidget her fingers in the lap.“That sounds serious, and like a long story is coming. I would defiantly prefer to hear it accompanied by a cup of tea. I’ll bring extra cups in case you change your mind.”Hazal looked around the room as they waited. The architecture was modern, but its owner had added homey rustic décor whenever possible. It was the kind of townhome with compact narrow floorplans but multiple stories adding a lot of space. Meita was speaking to herself without making any sound, maybe she was going over their story in her head.“Alright.” He returned and placed a tea set on the table between them. “Introductions first. You can call me Vass, young lady. Dr. Chenik if you wish to be formal. Who might you be?”“Hazal Ahu-Aptal. Pleased to meet you.”“Is that your costume for the next Trickster Ball or have you been spending time in the north?”“The latter. I’ve been rangifer herding for quite a few years now.”“And what brings you to my home Ms. Ahu-Aptal, Meita?”

Meita responds. “We’re in trouble, Vass. We need someplace safe to stay for a while. I’m sorry, I don’t want to bring any of it to your doorstep but you’re the only person I felt I could trust.”“What sort of trouble.”“Hazal is with the Jedi AgriCorps. She’s been living on our moon for over seven years now.”“I see…”“She can’t have anything to do with this so-called coup! She hasn’t been in direct contact with the temple for years!”As the ex-shopgirl continued their sad story Hazal reflected on how her abandonment by the Jedi establishment, which was particularly painful to her personally, was now a bit of a saving grace for stating their case. Her gaze wandered around the room until she spotted some glowing green eyes approaching from the stairwell at the far side of the living room. A fat tooka made its way over to her and sniffed the toe of one her moccasins before taking a seat on the rug and cocking its head to the side. Another with similar markings likewise gave her foot a sniff before rubbing its cheek on her shin. From out of nowhere a third pounced right on her lap, meowed, and flitted its tail under her nose. She let it sniff her hand and gave it scratches under its chin.When Meita breathlessly finished the story of their flight to freedom Vass took a sip of tea.“Well, quite a terrible situation. You’ve already passed the first trial for requesting sanctuary here, Ms. Ahu-Aptal. You’re obviously an animal lover. I can let you stay for a while. The guest bedroom is free. It will be rather cozy for the two of you, I’m afraid.”“I just need a bit of floorspace. I’m more used to my bedroll anyway, Doctor.”“Just Vass is fine. A friend of Meita’s is a friend of mine. Now if the authorities find out you are here I’ll have to deny you told me any of this. But thank you for telling me the truth. What are your long-term plans?”Meita tucks some flyaway hairs behind her ear. “I’ll try to find some work and when we have enough to start over someplace else, I’ll call my uncle and we’ll find somewhere will a larger Mirialan population where she won’t attract attention. That’s the farthest we’ve gotten in our planning.”“That’s good for a start. Mei let’s get your things inside. Then we can all get some rest. It’s getting late and I imagine you’re both spent.” That is how Hazal’s sojourn in Persistence began. She adapted as best she could. It’s not like she didn’t spend a lot of her winters and summers with a roof over her head once her tribe reached the seasonal grazing fields. It was quite nice having a refresher again. It was her first stop in the mornings to take care of her sanitary and hygiene needs. Regular access to mirrors was strange. The rangifer herders didn’t have much care for them. When you spend so much time without looking at your reflection you tend to get an internalized idea of what you look like that differs a bit from the reality. She wasn’t aware that she had so much sun and cold weather damage to the bridge of her nose. Luckily the doctor had a fine collection of skin care treatments. Her jawline and chin were a bit more masculine than she imagined in her head.  Hazal quickly realized now that she wasn’t wearing cold weather headgear she really could use a haircut. She preferred to keep it just short of her neckline. Now that it wasn’t being pressed down all the time it looked like her hair was a collection of depressed blackbirds that lived in her skull and they just forlornly flopped their wings around her head in haphazard directions. At least she was happy with her eyelashes. All the frost and wind had not damaged their length or luster in the slightest. After a shower she would happily admire her facial tattoo on her temple which she styled after the famous Jedi prodigy Vernestra Rwoh.Her new urban routine then led her down to the kitchen for a quick breakfast with her host and Meita before the two Pantorans would depart for work and job hunting respectively. Then it was just her and the pets. She explored the home as much as a respectful guest would dare. Though one window she could see most of a great big tree which was home to a pair of trinkies. She wasn’t sure if the trinkies were a mated pair or mother and son, but it was amusing watching them dash up and down the great trunk retrieving acorns they had buried the previous autumn and listening to them scold pedestrians passing by. The female was delightfully plump, and the male had most of its tail missing. Probably stolen by a near miss with a predator. This was the one tiny slice of nature to which she had access. She tried touching their minds with the Force like she did easily with the reindeer, but they were too far away. Instead, she would take nuts from the kitchen and toss them out the window. She always admired how trinkies scuttle across power and fiber optic lines overhand and wondered if it were possible for Jedi to master that kind of nimble dexterity. Maybe if they were a sentient species that had claws on their feet like Yoda.Another time filler for Hazal was getting back in touch with her formal Jedi training. Meditation was a must, of course. It was difficult because instead of emptying her mind of thoughts she often found her mind wandering to where she would like to be, memories of strolling though the trees of the taiga, sitting in the snow as she watched the herd scrape the ground searching for food, or the reassuring feel of Hazan’s ribs between her legs. Late night campfire stories with her tribe. She missed them terribly. No wonder her instructors warned so often of attachments.It did feel good to feel the flow of the Force once more as an act of intention rather than happenstance. She found a lightweight ball on a shelf downstairs and spent many afternoons rolling it around the guest bedroom floor without touching it. If she was to survive by her wits and the Force she best get back to practicing daily as she had when she was fourteen.Sometimes she got on the holonet to check the newsfeeds, but she had lived without such technology for so long that she found it bothersome and overwhelming. Besides, they all seemed to be toting the Empire party line.She walked up and down the three flights of stairs for exercise. It greatly confused and disturbed the tookas, who were used to near-humans having a set destination. Eventually she would have to stop and calm their minds with her preternatural ability and lots of grooming.She would open the refrigerator before realizing she was bored, not hungry, and closing it again.After she learned that Dr. Chernik took the Trickster Ball very seriously she took her measurements and began to design a traditional Mirialan outfit that would serve as camouflage once they quit this moon. He knew some quality costumers who would provide her with a fine facsimile.Sometimes she sat in a comfortable chair and looked at the walls.Alternating between all these little tasks she made it though the mornings, day, and afternoons. Then she would have companionship once more. Living without a tribe was quite an adjustment.  Meita, on the other hand, had quite different challenges. She quickly found some part-time restaurant work. None of the repair shops or local factories that would give her techie experience were hiring. This was clearly not enough so she courted gig work. Her daylight hours were busy with piles of dishes, customer service, and speeding all over town delivering meals, groceries, all sorts of deliveries. When she was waiting between gigs she would park somewhere and take out her portable terminal to catch up on schoolwork. Never knowing how much time she had for academics was infuriating. It divided her attention constantly. Her mouth hurt from smiling at customers all the time chasing that elusive perfect rating. Too much of her earnings went right back into her speeder bike’s maintenance and fuel. It was a constant grind. She tried to keep that inner fire alive, she was fighting a great injustice and helping preserve the great Jedi Order from authoritarian oppression. Unfortunately, inner fire was a luxury and she had to devote her battery life towards dozens of other pursuits just to maintain a sliver of profit.One particular evening Metia returned home, her eyelids already drooping and with soreness in her shoulders. She went right to the kitchen table and opened up her terminal. She was far behind in her assignments.Hazal took a seat opposite and smiled brightly. Finally, some companionship.“Hey, how was your day?”“Please. Just leave me be for a bit. I’m doing something.”“Can I get you something to eat or drink?”“I said leave me the kiff alone! Are you listening? Could you let me work for like a minute? Gods…” She turned back to her syllabus and all the red highlighted late notices.Hazal hovered for a few moments, then retreated to the guest bedroom to meditate for the fourth time that day.About fifteen minutes later there was a knock on the door.“Haz, I was a total sleemo back there, I’m sorry.”She opens the door to find a contrite Meita.“It’s okay, I know you’re sacrificing a lot for my benefit. I’m trying to help out as much as I can.”“And you probably are starving for fresh air and conversation. I got cashed out today, want to go to the cantina on the corner? I could really use a drink and some cheap bar food.”“You’ve got a deal.” Back in Meita’s borrowed poncho with the hood pulled over her head Hazal took in the milling evening crowd. Her friend (she thought of her as a friend now) joined her at her sidewalk adjacent booth with two pint glasses and a plate of appetizers.“Let’s start over. Hey, how was your day?”“It came. I met it head on. I kicked its ass.”“How long do you think it will take to get off-world?”The Pantoran girl rolls her shoulders. “Maybe another season or two if things keep up at this pace and we don’t get any unpleasant surprises.”“Thank you, Meita. For everything. I would have just panicked and rode into the woods. Become a hermit. Maybe younglings would have told folktales about my sightings.” She reaches across the table to touch her hand.“I can’t say it is too hard a life. You got me away from behind the Outpost’s cash register. I’m glad for that every day.”“Whatever hardships we face lets make the most of it.”They both smile. Meita finds her friends’ deep blue eyes reassuring and full of compassion. They made smalltalk for a while and relaxed. Just as it seemed they were reaching a state of normalcy there was a chime that sent a chill down Meita’s spine and confused Hazal as she had never herd it before. It was the public address system.Up and down the streets, and in private residences all over the planet, the chime sounded.  Holoprojectors switched on. There at the end of the block was the three-times-life-sized figure of Senator Chi Eekway Papanoida. She was draped in her usual royal garb. Behind her was her father, the Supreme Chairman, and to his side stood the Speaker of the Assembly and Interior Secretary Chuchi. The senator gazed sadly at the camera and spoke.“Citizens of Pantora. I have returned to you as your senator for the last time. The Imperial New Order has deemed our sector too remote to be considered part of the Outer Rim. We are now classified as an organized area of Wild Space. As such Pantora and the entire Sujimis Sector no longer qualifies for representation in the Galactic Senate. We will soon come under Imperial authorized corporate authority as a Special Economic Zone. This will cause some disruption in trade, but I have been assured that current contracts will be fulfilled as promised. The final round of bidding for corporate polity is already underway but we have no set timetable as to when it will be in place. The GAR garrison has already been relocated elsewhere but I assure you local law enforcement and planetary militia under the auspices of my father, the Chairman, are here to maintain law and order as well as defense. There is no need to panic. Interior Secretary Chuchi has sent out recommendations to local jurisdictions for the creation of public and private gardens to make up possible food supply and distribution issues. We are opening strategic reserves of seedstock to the public. There are also plans in place in case of shortfalls in other vital supplies and industries. This abrupt transition is regrettable. But our people are strong. Our will is strong. We shall meet any hardships together with the spirit that drove our proud Pantoran ancestors to the stars. I bid you farewell for now. May we meet the challenges of tomorrow with resolve.”The image sputtered out. The two women looked back at each other in shock.“Well, I guess you don’t have to worry about the clones at least?” Meita attempted a reassuring smile.“The crowds are starting to argue. We should finish our drinks and get back inside.”Later that evening Hazal, Meita, and Doctor Vass Chernik watched from an upstairs window as provincial police vehicles arrived. Someone had started a fire in the middle of the street. They could hear a murmuring of collective arguing as well as some shouts and screams. While the Empire’s attention was best avoided its abusive neglect defiantly had its downside. 




Notes:

Our heroines confront two hazards of our current age, quarantine and gig work.Trinkies are like squirrels and were the product of an early Internet hoax regarding speculation of the plot of Episode I that a teenager got printed by mainstream entertainment press. I had to throw them in sometime. Disney canonize trinkies you cowards.

Chapter Text
Durant Arnobri hurried though the wide corridors of the former Jedi Temple. The air still smelled of smoke despite the state-of-the-art air purifiers humming away. At least the burnt flesh odor was gone he thought. Everywhere there were workers preparing the building for unveiling as the new Imperial Palace. Durant was not here for the restoration and remodel. He was here to visit a place he thought of as his own personal temple. It was a place he had studied extensively but was never allowed physical access while the Jedi occupied these halls. He was ecstatic that he could finally set his eyes on this glorious masterpiece of data storage.“Let’s put our best foot forward, MAX.” He pats the droid he carries. It is just a blue durasteel box containing a powerful droid brain with one red photoreceptor, standard vocorder, audio inputs, and many data ports. The droid lacks arms and legs so Derant had a shoulder strap attached so he could easily carry it around. His work often had him hurrying form place to place.Finally, he was there. The great doors opened and Durant held his breath. Rows and rows of data servers. Blue blinking lights lining the walls and stacks. Several stories of them. The Jedi Temple Archives were one of the greatest wonders of the Republic. The sheer volume of digital and holographic information storage completely boggled his mind. He allowed himself a brief moment of awe before hurrying down the aisles to find the Lieutenant who summoned him.“Reporting as ordered, sir.” Durant didn’t bother with saluting; he wasn’t required to salute.Durant was currently working for what used to be Republic Military Security. So far their new uniforms had not arrived yet but he did notice their countenance had changed with the declaration of Empire. They were more impatient.“Finally! I have a thorny issue I need resolved. We’ve been comparing rosters of Jedi Service Corps members from years past to the most current and tracking down discrepancies. So far we have accounted for all but one. The servers are over there.“Yes sir.”Durant unfolded his portable stand and set MAX up. A holographic display appeared above the box as well as a virtual keyboard. He worked quickly but diligently, pulling up the overall architecture of the personnel rosters. A bead of sweat ran down the back of his neck. This was like a journeyman artist working on an ancient holy chapel while a captain of the king’s guard looked over their shoulder.“Oh, here’s the problem. There was a server migration to newer hardware about five years ago. Somehow the metadata on the file in question was garbled and the AI didn’t know what to do with it, so it was left in place on the older system. Just that one file in an empty directory.”“How can we find this Jedi?”“That’s simple.” Durant scanned the little lost file. “It seems this AgriCorp worker continued to submit regular updates and progress reports. The latest was… just a day prior to the purge. On Pantora. She was assigned there over seven years ago and never left.”“Karabast! We’ve just pulled all personnel out of there under the Frontier Redistricting Act.” The Lieutenant turns to an underling. “Who do we have available to track this one down?”“I’m afraid all teams have been assigned.”“Blast it. It will be a hassle to find new men…” He glares over at Derant. “You. You work for us and are trained in digital forensics. You can track someone down.” He takes up his datapad and angrily types. “I’m giving you temporary duty to travel to Pantora and find her. Keep careful track of expenses. Report back to headquarters for requisition of your gear and a ship.”“Sir, I can find her, but I’ve never even fired a blaster.”His superior rolls his eyes.“Fine. I’ll get you a clone. You there!” He snaps his fingers and beacons over one of the two Courscant Guard troopers guarding the door. “I’m drafting up orders to have you temporality reassigned to assist this man. Protect him and when he tracks down the Jedi execute her.”“Sir, yes sir!”“Get going, Arnobri. Report back in when the target has been eliminated.”Durant packed up his things and once he took one last glorious look around he hurried to the door. The white-and-maroon armored clone fell in behind him. He tried not to feel intimidated by the presence of this lab-grown killing machine, but grooves run into his emotional responses form all those years of childhood bullying were hard to silence.“Sir. Permission to speak, sir!”“Uhh, yeah. Sure.”“May I ask what your rank is, sir?”“Yes, I suppose the Lieutenant should have given me a temporary rank for this…”“Sir? What is your rank and grade?”“I’m a GS-09.”“GS-09? What do you do?”“Digital forensics for the Information Architecture and Knowledge Management Division.”“Information retrieval?”“Information architecture.”“You’re some kind of librarian. That’s why you were in the Archive.”“Digital forensics.”“Let me hear your best ‘shhh!’.”Durant attempted but a sad hiss emerged instead.“No, no. Like this.” The trooper got his helmet right in Durant’s face and held a pointer finger of one hand, the free hand not holding the gnarly looking blaster rifle, to his mouth. “SHHHHH!”“Shhhh.”“So, they assigned me to follow along a civilian, a Non-Supervisory civilian at that? Real babysitting work?” A strange noise emerged from his helmet. Durant realized after a bet that it was hoarse laughter. The clone peels off his helmet. He is smiling broadly with a dangerous look in his eyes. The sides of his head are closely shaved with a bit of wavy dark hair on top and he has a bit of a beard. Durant has never seen a clone’s face before. He is surprised that they are darker skinned than the Lieutenant but a few shades lighter than his own complexion. “I was just trying to judge how senior you were so I knew how often I could ask to be at ease. Turns out I don’t need to at all. I don’t need to respect anything you say if I don’t want to. Man! After over three years of war I could use a vacation like this.”“Don’t you have to follow my orders.”“I have to follow HIS orders.” He jabs a finger where they left the officer behind. “Don’t you fret, I’ll stand in front of any blaster bolt fired at you, and I’ll kill your little Jedi ditch-digger. It’s what I excel at. But I don’t have to do anything more than that if I don’t care to, civilian. And don’t you dare call me CT-4476. I’m Flux. That’s my name. Got it?”“Y-yes.”“Do you speak Pantoran?”“No.”“Better requisition a protocol droid or have a translation module installed on that pretty box of yours, then. Call me when you’re done packing up the ship. I’m going to 79s. Gonna make like a droid and have my scomp link serviced and exhaust port lubricated if you know what I mean. Bye for now, librarian.""Durant attempts to call after the clone as he swaggers away but Flux just turns around and shushes him loudly.“MAX, calculate how many minimum days I have until retirement.”“Calculating…” 




Notes:

We've finally made it to our main antagonist who is just as out of his depth as our two heroines. Plus, I've fulfilled my promise of having an original clone character.

Chapter Text
 “Are you scared.”“Come one, you know perfectly well that the Jedi train us to avoid fear.”“But you still feel it.”“Of course, I’m a sentient just like you.”“Hardly like me…”“More alike than you would think. I try not to feed my fear as much as possible and steer my attention towards enlightened self-interest, survival, and harmony. I guess.”“Maybe you could teach me how.”“I’ll do my best. It helps not being alone. But I miss my tribe.”“Do you miss the Jedi?”“I did for a few years.”“I wouldn’t have left them.”“It wasn’t up to me.”“What color was your lightsaber?”“You asked me that years ago.”“Humor me.”“It was icy blue. Like a glacier.” In her youth Hazal tried not to take its muted color as a sign of her low connection to the Force, but it was difficult.“Why’d they take it away?”“There wasn’t any reason for me to have it. A layperson might mistake me for a padawan or knight. I wasn’t a padawan or knight.”“It just seems sad.”“Wielding a lightsaber was not where my strengths were. I was glad to be moved somewhere I could be of real use to people.” That wasn’t entirely the truth, but Meita doesn’t press.“What do you think happened to it?”“They either turned it into a training saber, or replacement saber. Or took out the crystal to add to the Kyber Arch.”“I would have loved to see that. I wonder if it’s still there.”“I don’t think we’ll ever find out what happened to such monuments. I don’t want to know.”“I can’t believe they’re all dead. I helped you escape. Maybe other people out there helped out other Jedi?”“Maybe we’ll meet one sometime. Once we get off Pantora.”“The Empire is gone from here, maybe we don’t have to leave? Maybe Corporate Sector Authority will be lax about tracking you down?”“They will want to remain in good standing with the Empire. So that they retain power. Besides, I’m worried things will start getting ugly around here. I want to move on for your sake as well as mine.”“Traveling the galaxy with a Jedi. Who would have thought?”“A washout you mean.”“You’re still a Jedi, Hazal. Don’t turn away from what you are.”“I wish I could borrow a little of your faith.”“I’ll give you some. Use your Force powers or something.”Meita dangles her hand over the side of her bed. Lying on her bedroll Hazal reaches up to grasp it.“Thank you for having faith in me. And faith in the Force. It seems remote sometimes.”“You should realize how amazing you are. Ugh, that sounded so sappy. Sorry.”“Don’t worry about it. Try to get some sleep.” She squeezes her hand.“You too.”  Flux tosses the datapad onto the navigation station of the military skiff they requisitioned, then leans back in his chair with his hands behind his neck and puts his feet up there as well. Durant wishes he wouldn’t do stuff like that. He also wishes the trooper wouldn’t lounge around is his blacks during the flight, it’s distracting. But he was too intimidated to bring it up.“So, what do you think of our target?” Durant is curious what the soldier would draw from reading Hazal’s progress reports. Plus, there wasn’t much to do during hyperspace jumps but make conversation.“She reminds me of a story I heard. Clones love to pass around bleak war stories. Maybe it makes you thankful for your own situation even if you’re in the thick of it. It was about a squad in the liberation of Ryloth, so that caught my attention. I fought at Ryloth. Anyway, there was this forward operating base on the side of this mesa, right? They got surrounded by clankers. And they couldn’t com in for help because they were being jammed. Their officer took some men on a trek back to the front lines to get either reinforcements or to see if they could regroup with the others but got got. It was too far for the five-man squad they left behind to hear. They all just posted up at the firing line. The damned clankers decided it wasn’t worth the effort to neutralize them, so they kept them penned in by sniper fire while the main force bypassed their line of fire altogether. Most soldiers would have lost their nerve and tried to sneak out under the cover of night. Hell, maybe that would have been the smart thing to do. But these were good soldiers. They kept at their post obeying the last directive given to them. Maybe it was because they were shinies and hadn’t gained enough experience to develop a rebellious nature. I’ve heard both. Point is, they were there long after the battle was lost, holding fast.”“What happened to them?”“What do you think happened to them, they all died if dehydration. The last one left buried the other four and the Twi’leks found his desiccated body hunched over his rifle. The locals told me they buried him with his brothers and built a little memorial statue to him there, ‘The Last Watch’ or something like that. This Hazal girl, she lost all contact with her people and just kept carrying on doing the last thing they told her to do like a good little soldier.”Admirable, Flux thought. But then the pressure started back up inside his head. He could feel his heartbeat in the veins of his temple. It’s been like this when his mind wanders certain places in the last few weeks. Like when he tries to remember what Jedi Master Di last said to him before Syndulla’s people hefted up his stretcher and took him to safety while the rest of his unit made a stalling last stand that wiped them all out. He can remember what Captain Kelli said to him, but when he tries to remember the face of that Nikto Jedi and recall his words the pressure became overwhelming.“Do you think she’s a danger?”Flux switched his attention back to mission planning and the pressure quickly subsided.“She’s been herding karking deer for over a half-dozen years. Maybe she has a hunting rifle for fending off predators. At most. My armor can take that punishment like it was warm piss. Don’t you worry, little librarian. She’s no threat.”If she was no threat, why were they traveling to the edge of the galaxy to end her? The pressure returned and Flux tried to clear his mind of questions.  Urban architecture in Pantora favors flat rooftops and it is common to set up box gardens to plant a local succulent, the chartoshi vine. It grows easily and without much care. The vine’s coloration varies from magenta, to fuchsia, to a deep purple. These are the traditional colors of Pantoran nobility so to have them flourish in your city was a sign of patriotism and a kind of charm for collective wealth. Private citizens as well as municipalities encouraged this practice.Now all over the northern hemisphere and equator those vines were being pulled and mulched into biomass in favor of food crops that could be grown in small spaces. Hazal jumped at the chance to make herself useful and drew up plans for rooftop and window side garden boxes for Vass as well as instructions for soil composition, irrigation, and a rotation of legumes, beans, squash, leafy greens, and herbs. All three remember the shortages caused by the Trade Federation blockade a few years back. Everyone on Pantora took it seriously.Meita actually saw a bit of relief after the Imperial exodus. Her gig work completely dried up as the citizens of Perseverance tightened their budgets. Many shopkeepers sold off their remaining stock at cut-rate prices to earn enough credits to relocate to the Core or at least the Mid-Rim. That left many empty storefronts some of which were converted into repair shops. New technology was soon in limited supply, so everyone needed to preserve what they had. Meita was used to this practice from a life lived on the edge of civilization and she was glad to find work in her chosen field. She also had more time to spend at the townhouse for her coursework and she even started to join Hazal in meditation from time to time. The overall feeling off the group was wariness and suspicion of what might happen next. Even the pets seem to feel it. Every Pantoran citizen held their breath and waited.  Motina Chiran finishes adding up sales numbers now that the spring migration has passed though Solitary. Good. Good enough to pay off their bills for a while. Not great. Especially now that they cannot order new inventory until new trade agreements are ironed out. Who knows how long that would take? Motina disliked uncertainty especially when it came to the family business.She hears the door chime and puts on a smile to greet a potential customer and because of her sterling customer service acumen it only fades a fraction when she sees it is an armed clone trooper at her door. The clone scans the store interior for threats before stepping aside to let a human though whom approaches the counter.“Good day, are you the owner of this establishment?”“That I am, sir. How may I be of service? We have a little bit of everything here for the traveler.”“Just information, for now. We are searching for the Jedi AgriCorps worker known as Hazal Ahu-Aptal. I understand she would use your commlink to communicate back with her superiors.”“Yes. In the spring and autumn as the tribe who took her in passed though.”“Were you present during her last visit?”“Yes, the whole family helps out during migration. It’s a very busy time.”“Did she speak with any of you? Did she mention where she was going?”She glances over at the trooper. “She was just in and out again. Probably still with her tribe. They’re to the southeast.”“We know where they are. Did you notice anything unusual in her behavior that visit, or any visit?”“To be honest I was busy with customers as the time, and she didn’t buy anything.”“Did anyone else interact with her?”Fear grips her heart. “Not that I recall.”The human nods. “Thank you for your service to the Empire today.”Motina lets out a sigh or relief when they leave. She looks over at the commlink booth. Should she call her daughter? The fact that they were here proves they can monitor their communications. She would just have to hope her only daughter is clever enough to take care of herself. She had to know helping a Jedi would lead to danger and surely she has been preparing for trouble.   High Elder Pazadeta did not think much of these two. They spooked the herd landing so close. Pazadeta wouldn’t be surprised if it complicated labor for a few of the expecting does. Pantorans from the towns might be silly, but these two were downright disrespectful.“Lichen left us. She went off on her mount after she heard her fellow Jedi were to be executed for sedition. It was a few hours after the announcement.”The human waited for his silly box to translate their words to Basic. Truth be told Pazadeta spoke Basic nearly as well as most of the tribe but damned it they were going to make this a little bit easier for the strangers.“Do you know where she went?”“The woods. Away. Pity, she really is a big help with calving.”“Thank you for your assistance to the Empire.” Durant turns to Flux as they trudge back to their shuttle.“Well, this is a dead end. I suppose we need to plot out a search grid and start scanning.”“You’ve got to be kidding me.”“What?”“She had help.”“What makes you say that?”“The Jedi always used that commlink kiosk back at that depressing little village.”“Yes.”“This is a traditionalist herding tribe. Ain’t got much technology to speak of. She wrote weekly progress reports but submitted them biannually. This means she didn’t have a commlink of her own.”“It appears so.”“So, who tipped her off that the Jedi’s coup had failed? Think about it, the list of suspects is miniscule.”“News would have spread all over the holonet. It could be a lot of people.”“But who had the tech to find out that night and knew Hazal was just a few klicks down the way?”“It’s probably someone in that family.”“Do your librarian thing back at the ship and see who harbored pro-Jedi sentiments.”Durant gives the trooper a nod and hurries to the boarding ramp.Flux shakes his head. If he were the brains of this operation they were in trouble.“What a sod.”




Notes:

That episode of The Bad Batch had that vine growing all over Pantora so I'm assuming it is not just a weed. The snare is starting to tighten, let us see what happens.










Chapter 9





Chapter Text
“Seven, eight, nine, ten. And six extra.” Meita looked over the piles of credits they had managed to earn. Well, mostly her.“Do you think it’s enough?”“We’ll have to make do, Haz. Do you want yours back?”Meita had gone ahead and exchanged her friends’ Republic credits for Imperial when she picked up her chain code.“No. It’s just part of the pile now. Not like I can go out and spend them anywhere.”“We’ll get you a false code soon and you’ll be as free as anyone.”“Let’s try to save money until then. I’ll pack your lunches. How often do you get paid?”“As often as I complete jobs. I’ve got a binary load lifter I’m working on now, a real beast.”“Best of luck with that tomorrow. For now, let’s get some sleep.”   Durant highly suspected the daughter once they had found an archived cache of Jedi enthusiast message boards and tracked it to her hononet login. Her work was impressive, though her Avar Kriss/Reader story was overly long and could use some spelling correction. Suspicions were confirmed when he found the footage she had shot of the Jedi they were looking for dated just hours before she went off the grid. If he was a cruel man he would have the mother detained for lying. He was pleased to have a lead at least. They ran her employment history and set course to Perseverance.   The streets were nearly empty that morning and the beings that were about hurried along with their heads down. Meita made her way though the entrance of the repair shop and was about to go retrieve her toolbox when the sight of an armored clone trooper stopped her in her tracks. He stood still as a stature while this skinny little twerp standing next to her called out her name. Her boss, Li Chival, stood off to the side not willinng to give her eye contact.“Yeah, that’s me.”“Do you mind answering a few questions?”“Sure. What can I do for you?”“Do you know the whereabouts of Hazal Ahu-Aptal?”“No. I never want to see her again.” She looked down at the cracked plastoid flooring.“Why is that?”“I really looked up to the Jedi, the heroes of the Republic, the generals in the war. It was shocking to find out about their betrayal.”“That’s why you left home?”“Yeah, I needed a change of scenery and routine. Some time to think things over. It seemed like everything I believed had been upended.”“You don’t know where Hazal is?”“No. Probably with those rangifer herders?”The man looked to his clone companion, then back at Meita.“Why don’t you show us where you’ve been staying.”“Is that really necessary?”“Someone tipped off Ms. Ahu-Aptal that Jedi were wanted in connection to the coup attempt. I suspect that person was you. I just want to confirm some facts about your flight from Solitary and arrival here.”“Fine. He’ll just tell you what I did. He’s probably at work. I’ll call him so he can meet us there.”Meita tried not to panic while they retraced her steps back to the townhouse. She knew that clone trooper was deadly, the other one was harder to figure out.Vass was waiting for them at the doorway.“Good morning, who might you be?”“I am Durant Arobri, I have been authorized by the Military Security Bureau to track down a Jedi AgriCorps worker who was in contact with this young lady here. She has been staying with you?”“Yes.”“How do you know Ms. Chiran.”“She’s an old family friend.”“So it wasn’t unusual for her to come to stay?”“No.”“When did she arrive?”“A few days after the war ended.”“Alone?”“Naturally.”“Do you mind if we come inside and take a look around?”“Certainly, do you have a warrant?”“You wouldn’t let us come in out of a sense of patriotic duty? Two men doing our best to enact the wishes of our Emperor?”“Tempting, but you have to understand I am a small business owner. I would prefer to have full legal liability of a signed warrant before letting agents of the state into my private residence. Regrettably it was the Emperors’ wish that I no longer be a full citizen of the Empire. If you come back with the proper paperwork, I would be happy to let you in. Do you have any more questions?”Durant froze. He had no idea what the proper procedure was. Damn that Lieutenant.Flux, on the other hand, was struggling. How dare this civilian stand in their way. The pressure was giving him a splitting headache. His vision blurred. Legions of battle droids and Courscant street thugs couldn’t stand in his way. This blue veterinarian wasn’t about to get in the way of The Mission. He shouldered past Durant and shoved the Pantoran out of the way. “Thank you for your compliance, citizen.”   Upstairs in the guest bedroom Hazal was panicking. A few moments before she had stuffed all her belongings into her bedroll and by reaching out with the Force had cleared a space in the closet floor for her to stash it. It didn’t even occur to her that this was the most potent and controlled use of her abilities in years. There was only one stairwell down. She opened up the little window that looked out onto the alley and eased out feet first. With her fingertips on the windowsill, she telekinetically shut the window. This wouldn’t be enough. She’d have to let go and brace her fall. She had never managed this challenge as a youngling. Mirialans are more dexterous than most near-humans. Maybe she could tuck and roll when she lands. Flux went about clearing the rooms one by one working fast and efficiently. Commander Fox would have been proud of him. All he found were startled tooka. He made his way up the stairs. The rage had him. He knew that nothing would cease the pressure other than a dead Jedi at his feet.  Freefall. She bent her legs a bit and did manage a roll, but pain still shot up both her legs and her tailbone. She clamped her fingers over her mouth to avoid screaming. She scrambled across the pavement over to Meita’s bike which she kept covered with a tarp.  She rolled under its shadow just as she heard the window creaking open.  Flux drew his head back into the bedroom. Damn the gods, no one here. He took off his helmet and took several deep breaths. He could feel that his face was flushed and his heart was racing.The owner stormed into the room. “Please exit my home. As you can see no one else is here. If you want anything else come back with authorization form the local Pantoran gendarmes.”Flux just looked at the man in confusion for a second. He tried to collect what wits he had left and wandered back to the front door. Durant was just standing there like a fool. They should have brought more men so they could have surrounded the building. That’s basic trainee stuff.“Come on, librarian. We need to regroup.”When they were out of sight Meita gave Vass a tight hug and finally allowed her tears to flow. A few minutes later Vass sat on the kitchen floor and wrapped Hazal’s ankles in bandages. Meita was at her side with a hand on her shoulder.“Meita, you’re going to have to give your uncle a call. It would be best for the two of you to leave the moon as fast as you can.”

Chapter Text
The middle aged Pantoran woman, Chief Inspector Tochi judging by the plaque on her desk, clasped her hands together and gave them a look of concern.“I’m afraid there is not much I can do for you, Mr. Arobri. We haven’t had much guidance on how to handle matters of this delicacy since the handover to corporate polity. I advise you visit their new headquarters and inquire there.”“You can’t make one exception? This is a Jedi seditionist we are talking about!”“You mean like Ahsoka Tano?”“Precisely.”“The padawan who rescued the Chairman’s daughter during the Trade Federation blockade? I do so hope you bring that brigand to justice.”Durant looked over at the framed portrait of the Chairman and his family hanging up prominently behind the desk. It was clear he was going to get nowhere with this woman. “I am asking for the sake of our Empire.”“And what is your position with the Empire again?”He closed his eyes and sighed. “Please give me the address of corporate headquarters.” “Mei! How’s my niece today?”Meita leans in closer to the public commlink terminal. “I’m in some trouble, Uncle. I need to get out of here, soon. Are you close?”“That’s a pity, my dear. We were on Pantora a few months ago.” Her uncle looks confused. How much trouble could she get up to in Solitary? “Is there any way you can get off world without me?”“Not without attracting attention. I only want to trust family with this.” Any smuggler who would make a passenger run no questions asked would also be curious why such secrecy was needed, and there was a bounty out on Jedi.“Tell you what, I’ll move some contracts around and get over there as soon as I can. Get me a code I can reach you with and I’ll let you know when we are ready.”“Thank you, uncle.” The shiny gold and orange droid gesticulated wildly as it spoke. “Welcome to your local Pantoran government, brought to you by the Czerka Corporation! How may I be of assistance to you today?”Durant squared his shoulders. “I need a warrant for a private residence and business address to search for a known criminal of the Empire.”“I am afraid the proper executives are still in the process of relocating to this jurisdiction. Please leave a message with your com code and we shall get back to you in seven-to-ten business days!”From the corner of the room Flux began to laugh. “The medication will keep the pain and swelling down. Follow the instructions. Took a bit of math to work out the dosage for a sentient but it should work out.”“Thank you, Vass. For this and everything. I’m sorry we caused so much trouble.”“You were just existing. Trouble came for you from no fault of your own.”“You have a good heart. May the Force be with you.”“Blessings of the Goddess this holy time of year.”Meita burst open the kitchen door. Her appearance was still surprising to Hazal. She tried to dye her hair lavender to mask her appearance somewhat but with her little experience with bleaching it turned out more patchy pink.“We’re all packed up. Ready?”“Only if you will help carry me to my chariot.”The two Pantorans helped her down the stoop and onto the bike.“I owe you an apology, Mei.”“Why’s that?”“I was doubtful when we arrived that using the back alley would make much difference but hiding down here really did save me from the might of the Empire.”She smiles brightly. “Thanks. This time I at least know where we should go ahead of time.”“Where?”“Devotion.”The two put on their helmets and incorporate into the flow of city traffic. Left behind Vass makes one last close sweep to eliminate all evidence they were even there.  Defiance is the political capital of Pantora and its largest city, but Devotion is the seat of its soul. It contains in its center the largest and holiest temple to the Moon Goddess as well as major religious and administrative structures to the other three of the major pantheon and beachheads for many small cults. This makes it an important ecumenical and religious education destination. Most priest, nuns, acolytes, anchorites, monks, and deacons make their way though Devotion for a long stay at least once in their lives. Not to mention the countless pilgrims. And at no time is there more pilgrimage and travel to the city as the leadup to the Festival of the Moon Goddess. There was no finer option to blend in with a crowd on the little moon of one billion residents. Eventually Meita had to set the bike to hover and push her handlebars on foot while Hazal contritely rested her swollen ankles on the saddle. They were safe from notice in the absolute sea of sentients making their way for penance and absolution.Some came because they had unfinished business to lost loved ones and needed to unburden their conscience. The festival was a time to put those hurts to rest by bringing them to the goddess’s attention. Some were absolute villains wanting to wash a little blackness off their souls while they still walked with the living by giving to charitable works. Many more were just common everyday sinners wishing to unburden their common everyday sins just a little bit.The masses would conceal them. The controlled airspace during the festival would eliminate some watchful eyes from spotting them from above.The cramped blocks and looming brass onion domes of Persistence were impressive, but the glittering temple spires of Devotion were awe inspiring. So many contrasting architectures of religious tradition huddled together in mutual glory.Not all was holy in the saintliest of cities. There were pushers, pimps, and escorts of all sorts who were preached to but not wholly prosecuted out of existence. They had to be there. What was righteousness without temptation to define it? There were also all sorts of services to accommodate the mass pilgrimage. It only took a few stops to find a garage complex that accepted hard credits but had a lax attitude towards logging identification.Meita angled their ride into the little duracrete slab rectangle and shut off the engine. Then she detached their streamlined hovering cargo pod to place it in the corner and closed the garage door. Luckily it could lock from the inside and had a bare bulb in the celling.“It’s a cozy little hotel. I’ll unpack some essentials.”When the bedroll, some of Hazal’s deerskins, and sleeping bag where in place she carefully lowered herself down.“I’ve got something to celebrate our safety. I’ve been saving it for a special occasion. We can call it a sacrament for the festival.” She fishes a resealable bag from the pod. “The last bit of jerky from my previous life.”Meita smiles. “Thank you for saving it to share with me.” They huddled together for warmth in the unheated garage that night.“Maybe we can go out and find a Mirialan shrine for you to stop at tomorrow?”“I’m sure there’s one or two about.”“Its not fair there can’t be any formal Jedi representation here. How can you ban an entire religion?”Hazal turned to look at her. She could swear she could still see Meita’s big golden eyes with just the faint industrial glow of the lights coming in though the gaps in the door.“I don’t think it would be entirely possible, at least not without a whole Empire’s efforts over a whole generation. They’ll remember us.”“You’re using ‘us’ and not ‘them’, that makes me happy. That’s progress.”“Why do you idolize the Jedi so much?”“I guess some of it is the power fantasy. You wonder what you would do if you had those abilities. For a lot of it is awe that you have those abilities and that faith, and you use it for good deeds instead of all the stupid stuff I would be tempted to do with it. There’s the romance of it all. The unrequited love of two forbidden attachments. The lusty transgression of those who can’t resist temptation. Its not as flashy but don’t discount the fidelity of those who want to love but transform it into comradeship and mutual devotion to the higher nature of the Force. It’s so alluring, so much history and ways to express what it is to be a Jedi. I’ll never not find it fascinating. I grew up on the edge of nowhere. It was just felt so good to imagine a more adventurous life devoted to something bigger than yourself.”“I found Pantora fascinating just as it was. The north is full of more nuance than you realize. I feel like the Living and Cosmic Force led me here to learn and find a home.”“I’m so sorry you’ll be forced to leave it.” She squeezes Hazal’s arm.“It will still be here. Hopefully the Empire and Czerka Corporation will not change the things about it that I love.”“You’ll be carrying a bit of it with you. These skins and myself. I’ll stick by you.”“Thank you, Meita.”“You’re most welcome, Hazal. Try to get some sleep. We have some waiting to get though.”Hazal fidgeted to find a comfortable angle for her legs and meditated next to the radiating warmth of her companion. 




Notes:

I like how Meita provides me an outlet to explain to myself why I find these stories interesting.I ended so many chapters in my last story with two ladies snuggled up for a chaste sleep but really is there a more lovely way to close a chapter?

Chapter Text
  There was a little piece of Mirial on the moon Pantora. The stone was quarried from the wall of the Xocsali Valley. It was salmon pink sandstone shot through with narrow copper ore veins that oxidized to green. It was then shaped by journeymen sculptors as a test of skill for their mentors. The finished piece was sent to a temple complex on the southern reach and from there taken by a religious studies student to Devotion as a gift to the people of Pantora. It sits now at a far end of the Alley of the Gods by the side of a tenement block. Periodically it is maintained and repaired by the city commission for religious structures.Hazal leaned on Meita’s arm as they made their way down the alley, following instructions they had looked up this morning. She really did not need too much help; Vass’ medication was working wonders. She appreciated it, though. Hazal used this opportunity to try out her Mirialan modesty dress that they had ordered from the costumer. A stiff skullcap with sweeping wings extending a few centimeters over her ears and secured by a cloth strap under her jawline. Black wool robes secured around her middle by a belt with a decorative tabard. She even wore a veil over her nose and mouth just in case. She had to admit she looked the part.The Jedi’s eyes winded when the shrine came into view. “Oh! There it is. I see her.”The Alley of the Gods was particularly packed this morning. There were pilgrims, religious studies students, and quite a few hobbyists carrying datapads checking landmarks off one by one as if they were birdwatchers updating their life lists. The two slowly made their way though the queue. It gave Hazal time to admire the statue. Just a little over a meter tall figure of a woman with curvy hips, pregnant belly, full ample breasts, with one hand raised to the sky and another gracefully arched downward, she wore light flowing robes and stood on a square plinth. Like the other statuary and artifacts the statue rested on a white rectangular stand with a brass plaque with a few lines identifying pieces’ origin. Once standing before the statue the Pantorans gave her a little room, recognizing her as a practitioner of the deity. She lit some incense they had purchased that morning and poured some water into a stone basin that she supposed some visiting Mirialan had placed there some time ago. She took a moment for prayer and was turning to Meita about to let her know she was ready to go when a Pantoran man addressed her.“Excuse me, miss. I am here with my study group. We would be elated if you could say a few words about this piece.”She tried to wave them off, but the students seemed so interested. It tugged at her heart. She turned back to the statue and spoke loudly enough for the group to hear her.“This is She of the Running Waters, She of the Lakes, Rivers, and Streams. One of the most revered of Mirial’s pantheon as most of the planet is desert. She is just one of two gods we carve from stone rather than of wood. This is a sign of her dominion. She is born in the clouds. She blesses us with snow and sleet. She collects in our waterways and irrigates our crops. She is not just the goddess of the waters, but of fertility and fecundity. Whenever we drink or eat from local sources we partake of her favors. She is one of the cornerstones of life and therefore has our respect and penitence. She is beloved of expecting parents and farmers. Her favor can be predictable but sometimes fickle in times of drought. I am glad to see her here so well maintained and respected. Thank you all, Pantora.” She gave them a bow like she knew would be expected of an orthodox ascetic.She sighs as she limps off with Meita. “I’ll be surprised if she’s still standing here in a year.”“Why is that?”Hazal leans to whisper to her friend. “Because she is our avatar for the Living Force. We’re one of the few civilizations that worship the Force directly. The Empire will want to suppress her symbols outside of Mirial. It’s too deeply ingrained in my home planet but out here…”“Is there an avatar for the Cosmic Force?”“Yes. She of the Eyeless Face whose body is the galaxy itself. They are in love, but She of the Running Waters is betrothed to He of the Strong Foundations, god of the ground and soil. But the water evaporates and for a fleeting moment they can touch in the sky.”“That’s so romantic.” Meita smiles. “I’m glad you don’t name your gods, like us.”“How can a mortal name a god? No god is worth worship if they are foolish enough to let their true name get out there to the masses. It should be of such awe that even knowing it would burn a being to a cinder. I’ve always admired that about the Pantoran pantheon as well. Let’s get some supplies and get back to the garage.”   That frazzled librarian was still going all around town trying to make his authority take purchase. He charged Flux with watching the home he recently broke into. As if she would be foolish enough to walk out the door in broad daylight. Fortunately, there was a cantina on the corner with an excellent view of the building. He sat at a patio table and nursed a drink.Flux didn’t get this job. Not that a Jedi AgriCorps would run, it’s the details. Why would a selfless Jedi let some ditsy fangirl torpedo her future for her behalf? Maybe she was tired of the work and wanted someone else to plow her field for a change. He didn’t need anyone to tell him it gets lonely out in the field. Odds are they’re already in the wind and this whole thing is a waste of time. But at this point a waste of time for Flux was golden. He didn’t have any fantasies about retirement.  “Good afternoon, trooper.”It was that blasted veterinarian. Flux had an instant thought about how easy it would be to grasp the back of his neck and slam his nose into the table. That wasn’t fair to him. They had no actual evidence. He could just be a civilian returning from a regular workday. Flux looked him up and down. He looked like the kind of local he would try to warm his bones with at night during a long deployment. Weird how the service could warp your reactions this way.“Evening, Doctor.”“I don’t think we’ve been formally introduced.”He takes a sip before responding. “I’m Flux.”“I’m Vass. They’ve got you on the hurry-up-and-wait routine I see. I did a stint in the Pantoran Territorial Navy I know how it can be sometimes. I didn’t fight in a war like you did, mind you. Thank you for your service. Keep an eye out and take care.”“Wait.” The vet stopped his departure. “Isn’t the Festival of the Moon Goddess coming up?”“It is.”“Aren’t you supposed to do good deeds even for those who have wronged you?”“Yes.”“Why don’t you buy a fellow vet a drink? Old times sake.”Vass gives him a wry smile. “I’ll bite. What’ll you be having?”“Savareen brandy. Get a whole bottle.”“That’s gotten pretty expensive since the trade disruption.”“Doctor, it’s in your best interests. Believe me. Whole bottle.” The pressure was creeping back.Vass contemplates his next move for a bit. Flux thinks he looks like an art professor looking over an unorthodox piece what with that natty tweed cap and coat. He goes over to the bar and Flux glances around searching for the librarian.  Best not to have interlopers.Flux pops the cork and fills the two shot glasses Vass bought once he’s taken a seat with him. “To the old Republic and fallen friends.”“I’ll drink to that.”He swigs down the glass then raises the bottle to his lips and downs as much as he can with gusto, air burbling though the narrow neck. Vass looks concerned. He begins to rise but Flux grabs his arm. He only stops when the bottle is dregs.“Whew! I’ve had better vintage but that gets the job done.” It will take some  time to fully kick in. Time to attempt small talk. “Do you have any questions for me, Doctor? Pass the time, please.”Vass shrugs. “Why did they name you Flux?”“Because I kept fluctuating around half the GAR divisions. My squads and even generals kept getting wiped out. Ryloth with General Di. Got sent to this whelp Nadar Vebb next, he got himself nice and killed when I was up on the Venator waiting. Finn Eartay, Adi Gallia, most of them were off on their own little missions and I wasn’t even there. But the reputation as a bad luck charm got around. I was right there on Ringo Vinda for General Tiplar, though. Nasty stuff, that. In the end they sent me to Commander Fox so I couldn’t inadvertently curse another Jedi. Failed my way up to be a cop. Now they got me hunting Jedi. Run tell that.”“Sounds like a storied career.”“I’ve seen many worlds and gotten knocked around on almost all of them.” Flux smiles, he feels the alcohol kicking in. He hardly felt the pressure naming all his former Jedi Generals. Just a little more time. “They called me bad luck but I’m the one who lasted past the end of the war. I’ll have to sass them about that once I kark it and we meet in the afterlife.”“Well keep drinking like that and it won’t be much longer.”He stared the man down and refilled the vets’ glass before downing the remainder.“Talk to me now, tell me about your blasted pets.”He prattled on about his beloved tookas. When he didn’t feel like punching his lights out despite this Flux felt like he was drunk enough to make his move.“Listen Doc. This Jedi washout. The one you know nothing about and had nothing to do with. I feel for her. She got left behind like so many of my brothers. Not even for any worthwhile reason it was a damned computer error. But no one cared enough to notice. But she kept doing her duty. That’s admirable. Maybe even honorable.” The pressure and pounding were back but it was easier to ignore. “That girl. She’d better get off planet and far away as soon as possible.” He was gritting his teeth. It was getting harder to keep the saliva in his mouth. “We’ll be coming for her. I can tell you that, because as you say you have nothing to do with the matter. So, it’s safe… Catch my drift?”“I think I do, soldier.”“Have a happy festival, then. You can move along.”“Are you sure you don’t need some help somewhere to get your stomach pumped? Or just a place to sleep it off?”He laughs. “You’re one of the good ones, Doc. I’m Kamino issue. Tough as nails. I’ll be right as rain. Move along before I become boorish.”“Be well, soldier.”Flux sat along and massaged his temples. It was a while before it no longer felt like his head would explode.

Chapter Text
 Though she was holed up in that garage for most of the day Hazal was not uneasy as she had found some research to keep her occupied. It was bit of a hassle dealing with the shaky public holonet connection, but it put her at east to study where they should move on when they managed to sneak off Pantora. She looked up expectantly when Meita got back.“What’s the timetable?”“Tomorrow afternoon. He wants to meet us in the bogfields to the west of the city. Best to avoid the spaceport and its bureaucracy.”“I couldn’t agree more. We can do this, Mei! Not too much longer now.”“Then off into the beyond. You’ve got our route planned out?”“Some of it, we’ll improvise the rest.”   Things were turning around for Durant. Czerka Corporation had finally started cooperating with him, but too late to catch the suspect. The young Chiran and the suspect had obviously fled. There was no trace of her in Perseverance. He had set MAX on the task of scanning local holorecorings for facial and voice matches basted on the footage they had, and he had picked up an 86% match in a nearby city! Finally, a break. He could return to Courscant with laurels.“What’s the ‘Alley of the Gods’?” Was looking over the footage, getting to know his target.“Seems in this city they invite visitors to put up religious icons as a kind of cultural exchange. It loops all the way around the city center. It can’t rival Courscant’s museums, but it is quite the collection.”“Reckless of her. I wouldn’t have stuck my neck out like that. I guess it’s a testament of faith.”The CorpSec officer in Devotion was already on high alert overseeing the closing of the Moon Goddess Festival. It didn’t take much convincing to let him input the Chiran girl’s speeder on to the traffic monitoring system’s flag list.  It was hard waiting the next morning. They had everything packed up soon after breakfast. Meita had her toolbox out and was tuning up their ride, making sure it was in top condition for the aging beast that it was. Hazal mediated and did some math. She is twenty-three years old. She left her home to be trained by the Jedi at age three. When no master had selected her by age fourteen she went before the Council of Reassignment and was selected for the Agricultural Corps. One year of training. Another for assorted minor missions. Then she came here to Pantora as a team and volunteered to stay behind and complete their mission. She was not quite a legal adult when she came to this moon and spent seven years here. It would be quite the transition to move on again. It terrified her but it was time. She had to be ready.That afternoon they paid their final fees at the garage exit. Meita climbed to the skyway exit and followed joined the flow of traffic heading west. At one of the floating markers delineating the skyway a sensor read the machine-readable tag on the side of the bike, dutifully logging her license information with the central traffic computers. One of the CorpSec technicians sat a bit straighter in his chair. “We have them. Northeast quadrant of the city heading West”“Flux, get to that garage and have them loan you a speeder.”“Sir, yes sir.” Hazal looks out over the horizon. It’s a mild spring day, the ground fog hasn’t even burned off yet. She turns to admire the spires of Devotion one last time. It was a brief visit she mostly spent indoors but she was glad to have those memories. Such beautiful cathedrals, temples, chapels, and universities.And traffic police. Closing in on them.“Mei! We’ve got sirens going off behind us!”“Huh?” She turns to look as well causing the bike to wobble a bit. “Hold on!”Meita angles their trajectory upward and in an arc out of the skyway. They were so close, almost out of the city limits proper. Nothing to do but drop altitude and put on speed. Try to evade while sticking to a general westerly course. Flux gunned his engine. They had been spotted, of course, but better to lure them out of the flow of civilian traffic. He mused that if it was Skywalker or someone like that they would have swerved into the opposite lane of traffic daring them to endanger their own lives and the lives of commuters daring them to follow. Lucky for him this washout was no Skywalker. Still, it bothered him that they would catch her because she chose to express her faith. The only way to relieve the pressure was to take her down. Focus on the mission.
Good soldiers. Good soldiers.
 The buildings were mostly behind them. It was mostly lakes and sallow bogs now. Meita skimmed over the water creating quite a rooster tail wake behind them. They were still ahead of blaster range. Let these goons in their chintzy orange and yellow Corpo issued rides try and catch her. Her father assembled this ride with love and souped it up for her entire life. Plus, the Force was on their side. She clears a lake and weaves though a grove of Swamp Cypress trees.  Maybe she could lose them if she was clever. Most of the CorpSec team pulled up to clear the trees. Flux heard one splash into the water because they made the choice too late and raked the branches causing the speeder bike to spin out of control. Foolish. A soldier stays on target and commits.
Good soldiers. Good soldiers.
  Meita weaves the bike thought he swamps. Under branches. Over dead and bent trunks. Shooting trough gaps so small they must huddle down and have vines slap against their visored helmets.“Mei! How close are we to the rendezvous point?”“I dunno! Close?” He’s close. The clone’s vision sharpens. He reaches to the holster of his blaster, an action so well practiced it comes as natural as breathing. His mind is a focused point. He takes aim. A blaster bolt hisses by and the Pantoran girl yelps. They’re trying to kill them. It had been an abstract existential fear until now. Now it was all too present.“Meita! Can you think of your uncle and still keep flying?”“I think so.”Hazal places her fingertips at the back of her friends’ helmet and hangs on tight around her waist with her other hand. She draws from her the feeling of her relative, what his presence feels like. She closes her eyes, exhales and then inhales slowly reaching out with the Force.They fly clear of the trees and over a small sleepy town. Meita hugs the median of the street for a bit then cuts down an alley. They pass over a lakeside marina. Water ahead, no cover.“Mei! Climb! Three O’Clock! He’s a few hundred feet up!”“Got it!” She pushes all the speed she can accelerating towards a dot in the sky. Flux has them. He raises his weapon and lays down a line of fire trying to gauge their speed. He’s going to fall behind; his vehicle can’t match their trust. It has to be now. The passenger turns around to look at him. Fine, witness your doom if you like.
Good soldiers. Good soldiers.
They are a few dozen meters ahead but Flux can make out the woman raise her arm up, her hand splayed. She then jerks it down while making a fist. There is a loud metallic pop over the whine of engine noise. His bike shutters suddenly and goes into a spin. Flux leans to look at the fore of his craft and one of his directional veins is slightly bent. He has to struggle to maintain his course one-handed while maintaining fire. “Almost there!” Meita says it for her own sake as well as for her friend.Salvation slowly grows and takes shape before them, a XS stock light freighter. She pulls up alongside and waves to the cockpit. The craft banks a bit and their portside carbo pod doors open up. Flux grimaces behind his helmet. He can’t draw a bead on them with the nose of his bike wandering around beyond his control. He fires a few shots off in frustration before holstering his weapon so he can use both hands to limp the craft to solid ground. They’ve won this round. His head is pounding. “Relax your joints, Haz! I’ll need to cut the engines once we are aboard, so we don’t jostle around in there. We might have to leap clear of our ride!”Hazal pats her ribs to signal she heard. Almost there, they can hear the wind howling though the hollow space as they pull alongside. Meita kills power to the engines. Hazal grips her under her shoulders and leaps up, clear of the speeder bike which goes skidding across the hold until it is caught up in some cargo netting. The hold goes dark as the cargo door hydraulics engage and close up the doors. The wind is gone. The chaos is gone. The blaster fire is gone. Meita laughs from her spot on the floor tangled up with her friend. “I can’t believe. I just can’t.”A young human approaches them, their hair mussed up from the wind vortex a moment before. “Welcome aboard the Merganser, let me help you up.”Once on her feet Meita peels off her helmet and wipes the flop sweat off her forehead with the back of her hand. She gives the Jedi a wide grin.Hazal struggles to get her balance on her sore ankles. “Thank you so much for the rescue.”As she also removes her helmet Hazal feels a wash of surprise and then a pang of sadness wash over the human, apparent even with her novice ability to sense emotions from sentients.“Oh, hey…”

Chapter Text
 The two fugitives relax once they feel the freighter launch into hyperspace. Meita’s uncle came strolling in from the cockpit, carefully removing a pair of gloves. Hazal felt he was a surprisingly elderly man to have a niece her age. He had a scraggly grey beard and the shared the family cheek tattoos.“Just tree cruisers guarding the hyperspace route. It’ll be a sad day when my ship can’t make it past that. Introductions first. I am Captain Telma Chiran, this is my young associate, Tepoh. Now that I’ve broken my vow never to scramble my transponder code again and return to smuggling, what’s this mysterious trouble you couldn’t get into before?”Meita looks over at her. “I told the story last time, why don’t you tell it.”She nods. “Well, sir-““Captain!”“Captain. My name is Hazal Ahu-Aptal. I was with the Jedi Service Corps.”There is a fresh wave of wary emotions that wash off Tepoh. Hazal worries that she’s bungled it already. “I’ve been living with the rangifer herders of Levona Province over the last few years.”“That explains how you met my niece.”“Yes. She’s been my acquaintance for years. She rode out and rescued me, I wouldn’t even have known about the end of the war or the Empire if not for her.”“Uncle, we need to get her someplace safe, where she won’t stand out. And a fake identity card.”“No, we need two cards for the both of you, plus fake registration for your bike. I know you would want to keep that antique. It’s a tall order but I know some people, don’t fret.”“I’m sorry, uncle.”“Sorry for saving a life? You’ve got the blessings of the Moon Goddess and the luck of the Trickster it seems. Don’t apologize for doing a good deed. I’ve gotten myself out of plenty of trouble this is nothing out of the ordinary.” He and Tepoh share a glance. “She’s family. That’s what family does for each other.”“Thank you, uncle.”“Let’s get your things unpacked, it will be a few days. Tepoh my dear, why don’t I bunk with you for a spell? They can have the captain’s quarters.”Zhe nods then starts towards the cockpit. “I’ll keep watch for a bit if you don’t mind.”Captain Chiran watches zher exit and shakes his head. “I guess I’ll lend a hand with the unpacking.”   An hour later Hazal is alone nursing a mug of kaff with the ship’s tooka on her lap. Telma must have gotten him from his ex because like Vass’ pets he was named after a former Chancellor. She makes a mental note to ask the Captain about that after he and Meita are done looking over her bike for damages. Tepoh steps into the room and pauses when zhe sees her and tenses to backstep.“Hey, please don’t let me being here keep you from walking around your own ship. If I’m doing anything to make you uncomfortable, I’m sorry.” Tepoh sighs. “No, it’s not you. I’m just being stupid. You remind me of someone. Someone to which I had little bit of heartache recently. It would be speciesist of me to avoid you, though. It would be like someone being weird around me just for being human.”“Oh. Okay… Well do you want to relax a bit?”Zhe contritely nods and grabs a mug for zherself and takes a seat. After an awkward few moments Hazal speaks up again.“Do you want to talk about it? I’m a good listener and might be able to lend some Mirialan insight.”“Okay.” Zhe was quiet for a moment. “Her name was Mavi.”“Blue.”“Pardon?”“That’s what her name means. It’s a pretty common one, what with most of us having blue eyes.”“Yeah I guess that makes sense… Do you ever meet someone and it’s like you spot some abandoned pet in the rain by the side of the road? And you don’t care what put them there you just want to see if you can help?”“Oh absolutely, though mostly with reindeer.”“It was a pretty sad time in my life. The Senator and former Queen of Naboo had just died. My boss was really close with her, so she and I were all caught up in planning the funeral and morning rituals. It was supposed to be an exciting time for me. I was just about to launch the freight cooperative. Anyway, Captain Chiran met her first. She was applying for our first mate position. Just another refugee seemed like. I know just what that old bastard thought when she saw her.”“What did he think?”“Something along the lines of ‘look at this piece of flotsam that just washed to our shore, here’s what will cheer Tepoh up, another broken doll for zher to fix up’. I get so mad at him sometimes, not only because he makes assumptions about me. But since he was partners with my father and knew me my whole life he was absolutely correct. I've gone to him for advice after breaking up with all my exes. And then I want to be that much more upset with him when he pulls something like that because he has my number. You know?”“Yeah, a lot of the elders I lived with were like that. It’s the discomfort of being seen and seen so clearly.”“Just when you think you’re your own person and in charge of your own decisions. I didn’t, like, fall for her immediately. But I got interested because I saw someone that was maybe going though a familiar crisis of self-identity and wanted to mentor her. She had freshly buzzed off all her hair and was wearing tattered boys’ clothes. I thought I could help her find a new identity if that’s what she needed. I took her to shop for some decent clothes and she just picked out unisex work clothes. Got me no farther to understanding. That was another part of it, I guess. You could tell she was going through something but was just so hard to figure out. And little things were weird. Really good pilot but was clueless on a lot of basic aspects of spacer life. She was meek and timid a lot of the time but had at least one huge outburst of violence. Fortunately it was to save our lives not threaten them. Then she was scared of herself”“It’s part of sentience to be intrigued by a puzzle.”“And I had just gotten her to open up about her past and was really getting to care for her when I had to call it off. It was frustrating. Heartbreaking.“What happened?”Tepoh looks into zher mug for a time before answering. “Turns out she was an antiwar terrorist and escaped convict.”“Woah.”“Yeah. I would never have guessed that was what she was running from.”“Terrorist how?”“Like the one who sets off bombs and killed a bunch of people. Wasn’t even pro-Separatist or Republic, just wanted the war to end. I guess that’s a noble impulse. But a really dark mark to have to deal with when you’re falling for someone.”“I don’t blame you.”“We didn’t turn her in, but we had to let her off the ship after we found out about that. And I had to push for that. It would have broken me to give her up to the Empire.”“Wow, she must have had some really impressive tattoos.”“She did, but she had them all removed when she broke out of prison.”Hazal gasps.“What?”“I’ve just never heard of any Mirialan doing that!”“She was probably just disguising her appearance.”“Oh no. No. How many did she have?”“I don’t know, twenty to thirty?”“TWENTY to THIRTY?” The AgriCorps worker couldn’t imagine having that many.“Is that a big deal?”“Our tattoos mean a lot to us. Tepoh. I can tell you now she was going through a major crisis of self-identity, and you absolutely were a mentor to her.”“How do you mean?”“Mirialans believe our actions create our destinies. Like if you decide you’re too lazy to brush your teeth before bed that’s such a small decision, but if you make that a habit it leads to a lot of health consequences for you. Right? The bigger the impact of your actions the more it actualizes your destiny, your fate. Our markings are not self-expression. They celebrate important deeds and communicate our choices to other Mirialans. They communicate our fate. We get them for good actions and bad. Like if someone burns down an orphanage even if they weren’t caught it’s going on their face as a sign to others that’s who they are. I’m sure a part of it was that she wanted to disguise her appearance to avoid going back to jail. But it also tells me she wanted a complete break with her fate and disavowal of her past. Removing your tattoos, it’s just a huge thing to do.  I’d never give up mine.”“You have facial tattoos?”“Yeah, right here.” She points to her temple.“Oh. Sorry, I thought that was a birthmark.”Hazal runs her hand down her face. “Well, some of us have been separated from their culture for many formative years and maybe wasn’t talented enough to get twenty to thirty of them. Anyway, after doing something that drastic and not instantly spinning out in a self-destructive nosedive means you were likely a big help to her. Sorry things didn’t work out. But you can at least take comfort in that.”The Jedi can feel zher spirits raise a bit and can see it in zher expression. “Thanks for the advice. I won’t be weird around you anymore. You’re obviously very different than Mavi, and in a good way. If you’ve somehow ended up with a Chiran solidly in your corner it means you’re doing something very right. I can tell she’s devoted to helping you.”“I feel the same about her.”“I’ve heard a lot about her from her uncle. She’s a good person. Excitable, maybe.”“You’ve got that for sure.”“Stick with each other. It’s a scary galaxy out there and we all need someone we can count on.”With a nod Tepoh rises and goes back to the cabin. Hazal touches her tattoo and contemplates whether it would be possible to get some added retroactively. 




Notes:

This chapter solidly makes this story a sequel to Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Barriss Offee. I really enjoyed writing that in first person perspective because I wanted to explore Barriss'/Mavi's thoughts and emotions, but the downside is you miss out on the perceptions of the other characters. So, this was really fun, to explore what was going on in Tepoh's head in chapter 3 of Inevitable Rise.










Chapter 14





Chapter Text
  “Okay, fire him up.”Meita switches on the ignition and the bike raises off the scuffed cargo pod floor. She hurries over to her uncle’s side to watch the diagnostic readout. Everything up to spec, maybe not ideal for all the modifications.“Alright, help me with the hoist.”Telma swings the robotic arm over and they attach the straps and tighten up the slack to hold the speeder bike in place for repairs. Meita goes though the familiar task of measuring out metallic dust into a bottle, adding the precise amount of chemical catalyst, and connecting the mixture to the paint roller. By the time it is ready Telma has the scratches buffed out. They trade places and the young woman carefully lays down a coat of metallic epoxy over the bottom of the chassis. She muses this may be the hundredth time she’s done this. A lot of the bike is more epoxy than original.The two stow and clean the equipment they no longer need. Telma gets them both drink they can nurse while they wait for the epoxy to dry. It is a tradition they started once his niece was old enough to drink.“Alright, poppet. I want to have a talk.” He looks over at her. “It’s a bit late to ask ‘are you sure you want to do this’, you’ve committed. You’re on the Empire’s sensor screen and will have to dodge them at least until there is a regime change. The question now is what is your intention? What do you think you are doing?”“I didn’t intend anything. I was in shock and had to do something active to counter horror. I had to preserve whatever life I could.”“You’re sure about that?”“It just came from deep in my bones, uncle. I couldn’t not go warn her at the least.”“Do you think you two can keep traditions alive? Think she can train a padawan? She wasn’t trained as one herself.”“I think she can stay alive until she cannot anymore and that’s enough.”“She won’t be able to train you.”Meita’s shoulders slump. “I know that! I never wanted to actually be a Jedi. I’d fantasize about what it would be like. It’s interesting to me. But no.”“What do you want to be to her?”“Supportive? Cody to her Obi-Wan?”Telma grins. “Now you’re really telling on yourself.”“What?”“You think I’m so old I don’t go on the holonet? I’ve lurked in your boards. I know what you write about those two.”“That’s not what I meant!”He takes a sip from his can. “Are you sure?”“I write about romance, but I’d never dream of tempting an actual Jedi with that kind of attachment.”“Even with the Order functionally extinct?”“The Order is not the Jedi. The faith is the Jedi. The people and the practice are the Jedi.”“Alright.” He lets some silence slip in for a visit. “What if she makes the first move?”“I don’t know, uncle.” She looks down at the can in her lap. “I guess I’ll burn that bridge when I come to it.”“Are you sure you didn’t make this huge selfless gesture just to get out of Solitary?”This she can give him eye contact during response. “You left too. You were drawn out here. You know what it feels like to want to leave.”“That is true.”“I would have anyway once I worked up the nerve. This was just shock treatment.”“It’s the Chiran wandering spirit skipping a generation, I’m sure. I’m not going to condemn your choices. I just want to make you aware of the gravity well you’re caught in.”She nods.“Oh, before I forget. I received a strange call from Vass. He had a conversation with a clone trooper. Probably the one who was taking aim at you down there. He said to pass along ‘it was a computer error that caused her people to abandon her’, I assume that means Ms. Ahu-Aptal?”“Woah. That’s both relieving and upsetting I guess.”“The perversity of the Trickster plucking the threads of our fate. You should let her know. I thought it would be better from you than a relative stranger.”“You’re one of the stranger relatives I have.”“Hush, poppet. One more thing, will you rename your ride?”Meita glances over at the green lettering on the side of its engine. “Nah. I’m sure everyone will assume it’s ‘Great Storm’, two words. Isn’t it bad luck to rename a vehicle without selling it first?”  Hazal lounged in the captain’s bunk snacking on a common spacer staple, something that used to be vegetables but were dehydrated pulverized into a powder then extruded into a baked rod easily grasped by most sentients and dusted with salt. They were pretty cozy quarters full of shelves of little knickknacks collected from all his travels and dominated by a large oil painting of a Pantoran sailing vessel in a windstorm chasing after a breaching thall whale.Meita enters and flops onto the second bunk with a dramatic sigh.“How’s your ride?”“He’ll get us where we need to go. Why are you wearing your riding clothes?”“Because I’ll have to leave them here. Too identifiable.”“That’s sad.”“I will adjust.”“Hey, Vass found out something from one of the goons chasing us. The Jedi didn’t forget about you, there was a computer error.”“Oh.” Hazal pops another into her mouth and chews while  thinking this over.“How do you feel about that?”“Well, it was one of the options I considered. One of the least hurtful. I guess no one noticed.”“Maybe on some Cosmic Force level they knew you were where you needed to be.”“Maybe. Maybe it’s just comforting to believe that.”“I think it’s comforting. It’s one thing we’ve got going for us. This hulking political/military apparatus is out hunting for us but in the grand scheme of things we can often be too small to notice. We’re just two people. Pass me that bag, I’m starving.”“Is that going to be our goal, to be too insignificant to attract notice?”Meita crunches on a mouthful before replying. “Maybe until we find a community of some sort?”“Force knows how long that will take, and what form it will take.”“I’m certain that the center cannot hold on this whole Empire thing. You’ll be back with the rangifer eventually. They’ll make you Elder Lichen. Get you a fine headdress.”“Maybe you can convince them to adopt more technological gadgets and you will be the only maven who can fix them.”“Oooh, I don’t know if I could take that many cold nights in tents out in the wilderness.”“Yeah, took me a while to adjust from Courscant, but you get used to it. Did your uncle tell you where we are going?”“Somewhere in the Quence Sector, so not too much further.”“We’d better catch our breath and rest while we can.”Both girls lay in silence for a bit. Meita wondered what sort of scoundrel her uncle had in mind to get them proper paperwork and Hazal considered how her life path was forged by a few altered lines of computer code. 









Chapter 15

Chapter Text
  The Merganser slides smoothly back into realspace, swirling blue hues to star streaks to starfield.  A planet hangs in the distance with one red moon and two white. The four beings occupying the freighter are in the boxy cockpit contemplating the future.Telma Chiran weighing all the favors he can dangle in front of a powerful business contact in exchange for his niece’s continued safety and future life. He decides there is no ceiling he will not surpass but is willing to lay down a fight if it means avoiding binding her to this iniquitous planet.Tepoh is cautiously cultivating an inner garden of hope. Maybe it will bloom one day. Zhe thinks of all the tasks that require attention in the next fifty-two days and if zhe can find the time to break out zher art supplies and start a new painting, a gift for a friend. It’s been a long time since zhe made art. Fifty-two days until zhe can return to Ryloth. A lot can happen in a month and change. One could renounce their fate and remake themselves in that time.Hazal Ahu-Aptal thinks of the collection of credits she and Meita have assembled and how long it can last once they complete this last bothersome step. She looks forward to when they have will relative freedom of movement. If they can afford it she wants to take a few days for a religious ritual. She struggles to remember all the steps of bodily and mental purification required as preamble. It is all half-remembered lessons from Mirialan Jedi masters back when she was 13 and younger. She struggles to reassure herself that she is worthy.Meita Chiran has been going over and over her uncle’s questions over the last few days. She has been doing a little research on pop psychology in the holonet reading articles on maladaptive daydreaming. She frets that she has traded away a mundane but safe life for a handful of candyfloss. “This is Elishandruu Pica. Home of hot springs, health retreats, and pleasure palaces for the rich. One of the few spots like it in the Outer Rim.” Telma turns to his niece. “There were plenty of places closer to Pantora that could provide forged documents but those are all dens of spice runners and slavers.” One of the reasons Pantorans are so prideful of their heritage and why they were so loyal to the Republic was due to their close proximity to criminal empires.“Are we going to meet a slicer who hangs out in health spas?” Meita twists a lock of her hair. Tepoh was kind enough to sort out her bungled dye job and give it a trim.“I happen to know and have an in with a prominent businesswoman here. She wants to meet the two of you in person before she provides the services we need. Be careful, she might be a human, but she has the aspect of a karkarodon when it comes to making money. Do not tell her anything true that could be later leveraged against you.”“Do you trust her?”“To come through on a negotiated agreement, yes.”They drew closer to the planet and the largest city, Picavil. A huge entertainment complex dominated the urban area.  All the neon lighting was apparent in the afternoon sun. Hazal found it showy even by Courscant standards.“What’s that?”“That, my dear Hazal, is our eventual destination. Margath’s on Eishandruu Pica. It is a collection of health spas, fine dining, live entertainment, nightclubs, shopping districts, luxury hotels, and casinos. When the wealthy of the Mid Rim or Core Worlds want to make a deal or act out safe from the prying eyes of home they come here where anything goes, as long as you have the money. We have a meeting with the owner at the 27th Hour Social Club.”“And who is that?”“Kina Margath. Gods help and guide us.” They landed at a sizable spaceport seemingly abutted up against Margarth’s. There was still some time before their scheduled meeting so Hazal changed into some more appropriate clothing provided by Tepoh. She was far too tall for Meita’s wardrobe.  Right on time a representative arrived to escort them.“What about customs? Won’t I have to log my chain code here?” Meita glanced warily at her uncle before they descended the ramp.“Kina put up most of the funds to build this spaceport and her business taxes are a lifeline for the city, there won’t be any record of our arrival or departure if she doesn’t want there to be.” After travelling by foot and tram lines though underground service tunnels the three found themselves in a conference room. Meita guessed this was where Kina met for private deals due to the rather understated furnishings. Her anxiety increased with their travel and wait, her imagination running wild. What kind of vile gangster had her uncle gotten mixed up with? She was surprised when Kina Margath finally made their acquaintance. She entered the room with poise, giving them all a warm smile. She could not place Kina’s age, certainly over mid-thirty. But a woman who owned not one but a series of health spas surely had ways of masking her true age. Everything about her, from her precisely styled hair to her shimmering red and midnight black dress, radiating hospitality and luxury. She was undoubtably a fine master of ceremonies.“Captain Chiran, pleasure to see you again. It’s been far too long.”“Kina, you look amazing as usual.”“Let us make this quick.” She took a seat at her side of the table. “I need to get back to entertaining some friends of mine. These are the two young ladies in question?”“Yes.”“Don’t tell me your names. Tell me what you want your names to be on your identification.”“Disi Tavsan.” Hazal had hers all picked out.“Mergina… uh, Kvaila” Meita had to think on her feet.“Excellent. Now Chiran, Let’s hear your offer.”“I think five casks is more than fair.”“That’s rubbish, my friend. These are turbulent times, and this service is in high demand.”“I couldn’t go further than ten. Does that suffice?”“I don’t want to bankrupt you, Captain. I have a proposal that would cost you no credits at all. Just a few words and goodwill. I want an in with your supplier.”Telma frowns. “That’s as good as saying you no longer care for my company. You’re asking me to forfeit all the leverage I have.”Meita’s eyes flicked back and forth between the two of them. Five to ten what? Supplier of what? What sort of narcotics business was her uncle wrapped up in?Kina flashed a disarming smile. “My dear Telma, is this woman not of your family relation?” She taps her cheek referencing Meita’s tattoos. “Wouldn’t you want the best, safest alternate identification I can manage? I am talking about full references. If some law enforcement agent looks up her supposed primary school teacher, I will guarantee someone will answer the coms and vouch for her attendance. That is the sort of thorough work I am willing to provide. Because of our old and continued friendship. Isn’t she worth it?”“How about a counteroffer? I am part of a growing trade network who could supply you with an endless chain of the luxury goods you require. Would such a partnership appeal to you?”“Chiran, you know how I feel about unionized labor. I can’t have your trade cooperative landing here giving my staff ideas about collective bargaining. No deal. Just let me know who your supplier is and put in a good word for me.”“Excuse me, supplier of what?” Meita could no longer hold her tongue.“Oh, it’s nothing scandalous I assure you. I am a humble entertainer at heart. I love to be a good host. I love to hold court at my bar. Any entertainment complex such as mine needs marketing. At the 27th Hour my gimmick is if you order a drink recipe and we cannot make your nightly tab is on us. But you have to tell us the recipe. I have amassed tens of millions of them. Your relative here is my only reliable supplier of a particularly obscure and expensive fine liquor. I will not and cannot be seen selling an inferior stock at the 27th Hour. I’ve been trying to get him to pass on the secret of his supplier for years now. You’d think the safety of a pleasant lady like yourself would suffice.”Kina glances over at Hazal. “You, I’m not so sure of. Why do you think you can run off with such a polished Pantoran sapphire and not make an honest woman out of her? I see no ring on her finger. You know we have a fine selection of jewelry shops nearby I’m sure you could find something pretty.”Hazal crosses her arms. “I would love to, but we are just two struggling college kids, Lady Margath. Perhaps if you needed some part-time work while the IDs were being prepared, I could put something on layaway.”
“I’ll send my majordomo by to interview the two of you maybe we can work something out. I can provide you two with room and board, of course. All I require is your supplier.”Meita hopes she is not blushing too darkly. She looks over at her uncle.“Alright. It’s a deal. I hope this doesn’t mean my usefulness is at an end.”“My dear Chiran you tell such interesting stories you’re always most welcome at the 27th Hour. I’ll have my droids come by to complete the arrangements. Most pleasurable to meet you, Disi, Pana. I must get back to my guests if you will excuse me.”Telma lets out a long breath and Hazal can feel the tension draining off him. “That went as well as could be expected. In her favor, as usual. Good work wrangling some wages out of her, ‘Disi’. She has a point though you could at least ask permission to court my niece.”Hazal laughs while Meita desperately grasps for composure. 




Notes:

Ok, ok. I know I wanted to have mostly original characters for this fic but if I find one that fits the narrative from a sourcebook in the old West End Games roleplaying game which I haven't even read but sounds cool I'm going to use her.

Chapter Text
 Hazal did not bother to turn on the lights upon entering their apartment. She slouched over to her twin bed and eased onto the mattress. It’s not like it was difficult to navigate the staff housing in the dark, it was much like any economy hotel room you could find anywhere in the Galaxy. It would be a good time to meditate but she was too exhausted. How was this more mentally exhausting than following the heard for nine hours over the tundra and snowdrifts? She just rubbed her eyes with the palms of her hands and waited the short time left until Meita was also done with her shift.Meita was massaging her trapezius muscles when she entered. “Hey.”“Hey you.”“How’d it go today?”“I hope I never see another Tragon as long as I live. Who knew animals could be such divas? They’re supposed to be slightly empathic, so they must know how difficult they are. Being around all the other talent is do draining. Makes me feel so plain. My nose is too long, my brows aren’t professionally threaded, my chin is too strong. Even all the male performance talent are so beautiful.”Meita held her tongue. Hazal didn’t need a fangirl right now telling her that she was the most beautiful person on the planet in her opinion, even in ways surpassing the physical. She needed an ally. And she needed someone who saw her as a person not just a Jedi. “You should hang out down with us Ugnaghts in the maintenance levels, then. Keep us cave-dwellers company as we repair endless rows of slot machines.”“Don’t talk about my pretend fiancé that way or I’ll be forced to defend her honor. What do you want for dinner?”“You didn’t see it’s already here?”  She walked over to the dresser next to the unoccupied of the two beds. There sat a pewter tray with a lid and a pail of ice and chilled wine. “There’s a note. ‘To the happy couple who are to depart soon, K.’”Surely she must realize her joke was running thin. Why did she persist thinking they were a couple then issue them separate beds?“That’s nice of her. Do you want to have it out on the balcony again so we can watch the fireworks?”“Do you think they’ll be any different than last night?” Furniture was not provided for the balconies on the employee housing blocks so Meita sat up on the railing and Hazal leaned against the glass door. They shared the plate of finger foods and passed the bottle back and forth. It wasn’t much but the food was rich and would suffice. A few kilometers away fireworks and a lightshow brightened the horizon as it did every night they had been on Eishandruu Pica.“Tell me where we’re going again?”Hazal smiled, Meita was as eager to get there as she. “Saminiyet Chasma is on the more populated southern hemisphere. It’s a long canyon dotted with settlements. I remember it being beautiful. Hopefully there isn’t too much damage from the war.”“And it’ll be cold.”“Just a little colder than you’re used to, but dryer. We don’t have all those swamps and bogs like Pantora. I think the gravity is a bit stronger.”“I can’t wait to see it.”“Same. I fell in love with your home planet, I am looking forward to showing you mine. I just hope you like the color pink.”     Flux decided that his form of radical defiance against authority was to not take any of this seriously. They didn’t order them back to Courscant. They had them meet halfway in the Mid-Rim. Durant was taking this all very seriously. Here they were in one of the conference rooms on one of the new Victory Class Destroyers and Durant was sweating bullets. He’s been going over a defense of his after-action report for days now. Flux was determined to balance the scales by not caring as much as possible. In war dumb stuff like this just happens and mission objectives are not fulfilled. It shouldn’t be a big deal.The door hissed open and an old woman entered, tap-tap-tapping with a cane assisting her along. She wore a pressed grey uniform like the other officers but with a thick-fabric A line skirt and little differences in tailoring in the coat, plus a half-cape with the Imperial cog on the shoulder. The hat was a cute addition too, Flux thought. A little bit more of a brim with a grey lace widow’s weeds veil obscuring her features. She maybe had purplish skin. Flux couldn’t tell. Durant found her terrifying. Flux stubbornly refused to be anything but amused in a detached manner.The old woman dragged her chair out so she could ease to a seat with the assistance of her cane. She let them wait before responding for just the right level of discomfort. Damn, flux thought, she was a pro at this.“I have read your report and found it to be sufficient. Thank you for your service to the Empire.”That hung in the air for a while.“That’s it?” Durant was put even more on edge by the abruptness. “We failed to apprehend or neutralize the target. There’s to be no consequences?”“The lieutenant who assigned an unqualified field agent with insufficient resources has already been reprimanded. I will not make waste of a decent digital forensics technician. You are to return to where you belong. You are dismissed, Mr. Arnobri.”A look of relief passes over Durant in facial expression and posture. He looks over at Flux and wants to say something but instead decides to hurry out of the room before his luck changes. Flux gives him a shrug and a nod goodbye. To be honest he’s going to miss the pathetic bastard.“Now, trooper. I read your reports as well. I appreciate your candor. I have put in a request for transfer to your commander. I know, not another one. I feel you have a lot to offer us. You’ve served with so many Jedi generals and commanders. It offers us unique insight into their pathology. The clones they stuck us with are right out of basic and they are, as you say, shiny. I would like to have you in my personal guard as I go about some business.”“Sir. Permission to speak.”“Go ahead.”“What of this Service Corps woman, is she just going to slip though the cracks?”“I wouldn’t worry too much about her, trooper. We may just cross paths. She is fleeing to our destination. I have foreseen it.”Flux decided his detached schtick was getting a little tired. This old woman was starting to get his hackles up. What’s he to do though, orders are orders. He follows orders.“Sir, might I ask for your name and rank?”“I am the First Sister. And I am the Frist Sister. Just treat me like any other officer and we shall be copacetic.”“Yessir.”“This should be easy work for a seasoned veteran such as yourself. Bodyguard duty while we grow a little family. That should be familiar to you, as you have millions of brothers.”“I suppose.”She rises. “Come with me, then. I have some fancy new black armor for you.” 




Notes:

A no-prize to anyone who can identify who the First Sister really is. I'm not gonna tag her.

Chapter Text
 Meita studies Mirial as they maneuver into orbit. The small yacht Kina chartered for them had an excellent passenger viewing platform. From a distance the planet was a blurry pink and green ball. Now on approach she can make out nuances of color, salmon pink, rusty mountain ranges, blotches of olive green forest and scrubland, painted deserts, long escarpments along the continental shelves, wispy clouds, the swirl of an ice cap on the closest pole, even a few deep blue lakes.Hazal tempers her excitement until they work their way though planetary traffic and make their decent. After landing they wait by the entry ramp. It opens letting in a gust of wind and a few particles of snow. She makes her way down, savoring a long breath of bracing air. Wind tugged at her dress seeking to steal away the warm pockets of air close to her body. This is what a proper planet feels like, you should be able to feel it in the stinging joints of your fingers.Behind the ship was the wide expanse of Saminiyet Chasma. Saminiyet City, North and South covers the walls of the great canyon for many kilometers. The canyon floors were lined with greenhouses, irrigated by the river that ran though the canyon. Only the far side of North Saminiyet was visible from the spaceport on the canyon’s edge. There was a slight orange haze along the horizon even in the early afternoon sunlight.“Let’s make our way though customs and immigration.” Hazal took her companion’s arm and they walked along a painted yellow line on the tarmac. “They’ll unload your bike and our luggage. They will be waiting for us.”“There’s a lot of troopers here, Haz…”“Mirial was behind Separatist lines during the war. They’re probably keeping a heavy presence here in case of rebellion. Just behave like we deserve to be here. We do deserve to be here.”The administrative building was a blocky two-story building. It looked to Meita like someone took a rectangular sheet of durasteel, folded it into a box with rounded edges, and built a building inside the length of a city block. “Is that the local style of architecture?”“You really haven’t seen one of those before? I thought Pantora had long ties to the Trade Federation.”“It did, but no.”“That is a pretty standard Federation prefabricated multi-use construction. The lip around the frame makes it easy to attach to a cargo ship and they just bring them down from orbit. They can be fully self-sufficient or be hooked up to local power and sewer services. It looks like this whole spaceport was bombed out during the war, see there were their used to be a foundation? You can find these all over the planet. I guess Pantora was a little better off than here.”They made their way through the line with bureaucratic efficiency as screens lining the walls issued compliance instructions interspersed with messages from members of the Legislative Assembly praising the new Imperial regime. Kina’s chain codes held up to scrutiny. Mirial was hungry for immigration and investment after years of war. Soon they were making their way down a ramp with fellow newcomers towards the city.Hazal squeezed Meita’s arm from her seat behind her on Greatstorm. “Let’s get you your first taste of local cuisine.”They rode down a broad ramp to the city proper. There was less damage from the war. Buildings were primarily made of brick and huddled close to the canyon wall. A hover tram line, speeder lanes, and pedestrian walkways arced along closer to the canyon’s edge. They pulled off the road at street vendor that like the customs house was built out of three nine foot tall rectangular steel structures linked together. Meita guessed it was probably also a Trade Federation model. At least these buildings were colorfully painted. They took a seat at an adjacent table and were soon greeted by a mauve skinned Mirialan woman who provided them with two mugs and a teapot. She looked at Meita with curiosity but spoke with Hazal in their native language.“She’s curious about your tattoos.” Hazal translated.The server touched her own tattoos, an asymmetric collection of hexagons on one cheek and addressed her in accented Basic. “She tells me it is a family pattern? What did you do to earn them?”“I guess I was just born and reached adulthood, I guess.”The server gave her a sardonic look then spoke a few chiding words to Hazal.“What did she say?”“She could tell my clothes weren’t made with local wool. Sharp eye. I decided to ask for their specialty. Hope you don’t mind me ordering for you.”“I honestly wouldn’t have known where to begin.”“What do you think of the planet so far?”“Picturesque. This whole city must have an amazing view of the canyon.”“Yeah, it’s mostly to get shelter from the winds while taking advantage of the river valley. There are a lot of cliff cities like this. We have to take advantage of local water supplies however we can.”“How do you feel about being back.”“I’m not sure it’s quite sunk in. I mean, I spent just my first three years of life here. Then I would go back ever two or three years on a sort of pilgrimage. I’m lucky I still remember the language to tell you the truth.”“Hopefully we can stay here a while. It feels good to be able to walk around in public again.”“Oh yeah. I hope the trinkies in Vass’ tree are doing okay. I got really attached to those two.”Their specialty dish turned out to be soup. Meita took her first spoonful, swished it around in her mouth.“What do you think?”“What is that flavor?”“It’s mostly cactus and nut milk. There’s some root vegetables and tubers. Looks like some reed shoots. I see some mycoprotein in here as well.”“And the spices?”“That’s just pepper flakes. Mirialans have been growing them in greenhouses since they were introduced by traders. A more traditional recipe would be spiced with ant venom.”“Really?”“Yeah, roasted stinging ants. There are two things we don’t take for granted over here, water and sources of protein. You use whatever you have on hand.”Meita looked over at the server who was chatting with another customer. “Do you think I should learn the language?”“Maybe if we decide to stay for the long-term. Most people speak Basic here anyway. What you should learn is how to repair the most popular brands of moisture vaporators. You’ll never go without work then.”“I imagine we aren’t staying in this city for much longer?”“You’ll be able to find work most anywhere, but I need to go seek out the cattle stations out in the plains and mountains. Hopefully you’ll come with me?”“Naturally. Hey, why am I seeing that star painted all over town?” She points with her spoon to a decoration on the side of the eatery.“Oh, that’s a compass blossom. Some call them compass winds. It’s important to know what direction you are travelling in the desert, so it’s considered to be a sign of good luck. Since we’re in the Southern Hemisphere these mostly point South. Each direction has a spiritual connotation.”“How so?”“Well, She of the Flowing Waters is associated with the North, towards the Equator where it’s warm and there is more water. The Sun is the East, naturally. The South is associated cold winds and The Still One, spirit of stasis and remembrance. She of the Eyeless Face is the West since that is where the night sky retreats in the mornings. Pretty standard symbolic cosmology, really.”“We don’t have anything like that back home.”“Well, you have oceans and lots of landmarks.”“The War God is associated with the North I suppose. The others don’t really have much directional significance, we’re seasonal. We only travel North to celebrate the War God to commemorate his conquest of the cold during summer, come to think of it.”“That’s what I love about religion, every planet interpreting reality in unique ways. I’m glad this soup is so good. It’ll be my last meal for a bit.”“Why?”“I need to fast for a day or two.”“Why?”“I need to ask a goddess for some advice.”   They traveled for two days along the canyon wall, North by Northeast, towards the Equator. The landscape around them changed from hearty scrub brush clinging to the precipice to actual tree groves when the ground flattened a bit. They wove though mesas which usually had little villages clustered in their shadows. Close to sundown on the second day they arrived at Hazal’s destination, the Monastery at Aureum Kargasa. Two red brick pillars marked the entrance, peaked with pyramids and covered in calligraphy prayers. The main buildings beyond sat on a small hill. Sunlight pained the walls in brilliant orange.Hazal eased off the speeder bike. “Feel free to go back to that hostel we passed a few kilometers back. I won’t be done until morning.”“I’m worried, somehow. This is a big thing for you. I wish I could be there.”“It’s a solitary experience, I’m afraid. I’ll be fine. Maybe a bit drained afterwards. You can treat me to a big breakfast then keep me company while I have a nap.”“I’ll see you soon.” Her big golden eyes waver a bit. “May the Force be with you.”“Thank you, Meita. See you soon.”  She bowed and said a prayer before passing between the pillars and up the gravel path. She bypassed the cathedral in favor of a one-story durasteel structure off to the side. A cleric rose from her seat by the entrance to speak with her. She was dressed in the head-to-toe black wool garments of her faith.“Are you of good health to endure the ritual, and have you prepared?”“Yes.”“Go in faith.”She entered the foyer and the door sealed tightly behind her. It was already several degrees warmer. There were a series of lockers here. Hazal chose one that contained a simple undyed linen camisole her size. She then went to an adjoining changing room, returning to place her possessions inside and securing the locker. She then entered the building proper, she hurried inside to avoid letting out an abundance of steam. The main room of the building was a huge sauna. A heating element ran down the center of the room, covered in round stones. Attendants walked its length occasionally pouring out water resulting in soft hissing sounds. The air was thick, humid, and very warm. Hazal was lucky, there weren’t too many worshipers here tonight. She would still have to spend some time getting into a proper emotional state but on high holidays she wouldn’t be guaranteed an audience.She took a seat on one of the hardwood benches. Now she just had to meditate. Ignore the heavy mist in the air. Ignore the wet heat. Ignore the rivulets of sweat running down her back and the fabric sticking to her skin. She reflected that her sweat was a sacrament. The building was designed to capture and reuse as much water as possible. The water poured over the stones was the past sweat of countless previous parishioners.  She was donating water from her body to be here.She reflected on her faith. Like the other Mirialan Jedi she had regular classes as a youngling focusing on the religion of her home planet. She held on to their teachings during her time with the rangifer herds. It was maybe not a core part of her life, but she remembered and recited the prayers. And now she was back for the first time as an adult. She hoped the gods would not forsake her long years away. She pushed back the knowledge that many seekers before her come to perform this ritual and leave without the proper experience.After what felt like a few hours an attendant gave her a tap on the shoulder and helped her to her feet. She was careful to move slowly and be wary of a drop in blood pressure. She was still young. She could withstand this. It was meant to be an ordeal. At the far end was an identical set of doors and an identical foyer. Hazal paused and took a few long, slow breaths now that the air wasn’t thick with moisture. This was it. One last precipice.She opened the door and stepped outside. She gasped at the shock of it. The cutting cold wind tore at her, at her wet clothes. Her exhaled breathes came out in brilliant white plumes. Sleet stung her eyes. She was disoriented. Another cleric wrapped a blanket around her shoulders. This was meant to be an ordeal, but a survivable one. She led Hazal down another path to a mosaic stone clearing with four smaller ceremonial pillars set in alignment with the cardinal directions. She faced to the West and the cleric helped her shakily to her knees.This was a true test of meditation. Her body was shivering, her teeth chattering. She already felt weakened. Focus, now, Focus! She calmed her mind. Slowly the outside world fell away. The sound of the wind. The light from the surrounding buildings, the moons, the stars, the hard surface of the mosaic floor behind her knees and feet. Most difficult was the cold. But Hazal was determined. She was one with the Force, and the Force was with her. An immeasurable time later she was at peace. And she was not alone. Hazal opened her eyes and the whole Galaxy was before her. Then the stars shifted and formed into a new shape. The shape of a woman. Pointillism stars formed her body, hazy nebulae formed the cloak she wore. The was made of stars, all except for her eyes. Her eyes were the void. The form was familiar to Hazal, she was the shape and relative size as her hazy memories of her mother when she last saw her at three years of age.“Child of Mirial, daughter of the Force, you have returned.” That’s not right, that’s not what she’s supposed to say. “Do you come in faith?” That’s more like it.“I come in faith and ask for your hand to guide me.”The goddess came closer. “Hazal Ahu-Aptal. You seek my advice.”“Yes.”She smiled. “I am glad to see you. I was beginning to worry I would seldom see your kind again.”“No other Mirialan Jedi have sought you out?”“Come now, you know I cannot disclose that. Just as my words for you are for you alone. Now please, speak.”“I don’t know what to do.”“You know very well what you should do.”“What?”She changed shape, stars shifting closer together until she was a much smaller figure, one Hazal quickly recognized as her role model Vernestra Rwoh as she appeared in illustrations as a newly knighted youth. The nebulae of her clothing shines brightly like her white and gold temple robes being closer together.“Survive. All I would ask you to do at this time, all anyone could ask of you is to survive. You’ve been doing admirably.”“Just barely.”The goddess began to pace. “You defeated a clone trooper, did you not?”“Maybe delayed him. I bent a sheet of metal.”“That’s more than most Jedi Masters managed, even after nearly four years of wartime experience. Don’t sell yourself short. You survived and you had the shield of a true friend’s affection to defend you.”“I don’t know why, when so many others died.”“You feel inadequate, unworthy.” The goddess shaped like Rwoh fixes her with a steely void-eyed glare.“Yes.”“It’s true, you were passed over. You did not have the talent, the power, the finesse to be chosen as a padawan. But did it ever occur to you that was your destiny? It was your fate to be passed over so you could survive?”“It did occur, it seemed like I was trying to justify myself.”“I thought you said you came to walk a faith guided path.”“Yes.”“Well, this is your path. If you feel there must be some greater symbolic cosmic reason or justification for your continuation despite great tragedies think of it as your destiny. This is your great trial. You need faith. You need to survive. It doesn’t matter how dim the ember you carry; it is the light of the Jedi. For Light and Life. If almost all my stars winked out, do you think I would forsake the dimmest of them?”“No.”“Then forsake self-loathing and doubt. You are to survive, and you are to run, and when you cannot run to defend. What comes after that is community. There is strength in numbers.”“Alright.”“I’m still not hearing what I want from you. Listen, you were passed over, it’s true. But then you had to rely on your knowledge and your wisdom. Do not discount that. How many other Jedi discounted wisdom because they had a surplus of talent? It was to their detriment. And then you were abandoned, were you not?”“Yes.”“And you found community, and that was your strength. Do not dwell on your weaknesses, feed your strengths. Because you have them, I assure you. And you have a caring heart. Use it. You had little talent with a lightsaber, do not seek one. Seek what will truly protect you. What makes you strong. Understand?”“I will when I need to. I need to dwell on your words.”The goddess smiles. “Good. Anything else?”Hazal hesitates. “You, you are in love with She of the Flowing Waters.”Her form expands, grows taller, she takes the familiar shape of Luminara Unduli. “Very much so. I can feel her waters flow through the blood in your veins. It calls to me.”“I’ve always wondered, how does that fit in with what I was taught about attachments?”“It is true, that was a troublesome point of contention when the Jedi came to Mirial and sought to train our children. We had to stand firm to hold on to our traditions. It is true I love her. But do you think I am attached to her in a destructive way? I allow her to fall back to Mirial. I permit us only fleeting touch. If I jealously held on to her she could not perform her destiny and give life to our people.”“I see.”“Why do you think I love her?”“Some use a scientific metaphor. Substance seeks the void.”“But you know this is not true.”“No. Because you are the void. But you are more than that.”“I am the cosmic. I am mostly void, but partly everything. Even my dark matter has substance. That being so why do you think I love her?”Hazal struggles a bit to think. “Duality. The Cosmic Force is linked with the Living Force.”“See, you’re smarter than you give yourself credit for.”“But what of attachments?”“Attachments are to be interrogated for the mental and spiritual health of the Jedi; it is true. Would it surprise you to know unhealthy attachment was the doom of your Order?”“Should I forsake attachments?”“You should be wary and aware of your attachments. You should not forsake love. I would be a hypocrite to ask you that. Love is important to all of us.”“There is a nuance I am missing but I will think over your words.”She shifts form again, a little shorter, a woman a little younger than Hazal in a hooded cloak. She seems vaguely familiar and speaks with a Courscanti accent. “Is your worry of attachments due to defying the will of the Council?”“Um.”“There is not Council left to defy. The Council had to deal with the ramifications of their mistakes, of their hubris. The Galaxy is suffering because of inequities of the Council. They are not here to guide you. That makes this a dangerous time for you. But do not ignore your feelings. Listen to them. Learn from them. Your heart is one of your guides as well as your faith. Never forget that.”“I will heed your words.”The goddess shifted one last time into the formidable form of Cyslin Myr, the Master who trained Mace Windu. “That is all the advice I have for you for now. I dare not further test your fortitude keeping you here much longer. Go now, Hazal Ahu-Aptal. Go in strength. Survive and thrive. Do so in the name of those fallen. Do so with faith.”  Hazal gasped. She held her arms out to catch herself from falling over. The cold returned. The hard floor returned beneath her. The stars to the West were disappearing into the violet sky of dawn.Cathedral attendants hurried to her side. “Let’s get you to your feet, child. See if you can walk.”“I walk a faith guided path!”“Of course you do, dear.”One of them offered her a mug. Its warmth seemed to burn her hands at first, but she accepted it. She sipped deeply. It was a slightly salty bone broth. They refilled her mug. She gratefully drank it down. They took her back down to the sauna. Thankfully the heating element had long been turned off. It was not shockingly warm. She was glad to be out of the elements. One of them stayed to provide for her needs as she recovered. Eventually she was stable enough to shower and change back into her clothes.It didn’t matter to Hazal whether what she experienced really happened or was just a hallucination or her subconscious talking to herself. Those words she heard were the truth. She was sure of it. Meita was there waiting for her outside. She beamed and waved. Silly town girl. She was wearing her parka and a knit cap with a ridiculous pom on the top. Hazal’s affection and gratitude upon seeing her almost overwhelmed her. She could feel her chapped lips split a little with how widely the sight of her friend made her smile.“Hey, are you okay?”“I will be with some rest. And some more warm drinks. And maybe some breakfast.”“Let’s get some, then.” She gave her a warm hug.“Did you get the answers you were after?”“Yes, I think I did.” 




Notes:

The fourth form of the goddess was Barriss Offee if that wasn't clear. Hazal hasn’t seen her since Barriss was like nine years old so she didn’t recognize her. My gratitude to the late Fritz Leiber, thank you for inspiring me borrow the idea of ""___ of the Eyeless Face"" for the name of a powerful being. We do not have the names of any of the Mirialan gods in canon so I'm having to make them up as I go.

Chapter Text
  Hazal had never had to search for employment. Meita was a novice having only started this year after a lifetime of being groomed for the family business, but she was a great help creating a spreadsheet with names, locations, and contact numbers for cattle stations. The two claimed a table in a spacious tea house with free holonet access and started calling. To keep their spirits up they made a game of guessing which excuse they would hear as to why that next station on the list was not hiring. Mostly it was due to the war creating so many internally displaced refugees. It was an insular community, so station owners tended to give priority to herders they already knew. More than one was in foreclosure and in a personnel freeze. Hazal found it harder to cultivate hope the further they got down the list.Meita tried to cheer her up. “I’ll find a job in one of the cities and you can find some fill-in work.”“No, I don’t want to repeat what we had to do in Perseverance. I don’t want to burden you. There’s one on the list we skipped because we couldn’t find a number. Let’s go there in person and state our case. We’ve got to find one before our credits run dry.”“Why do you think they’d take us on?”“It’s not the biggest in area and probably have less heads but they have something that gives them immeasurable wealth. They have a lake.”They loaded up Greatstorm once more and made their way through the rolling foothills of the Iani Mountains. Towns became steadily smaller and further apart. After a day on the long straight roads they switched to narrow switchbacks that wove though the mountains proper. When they stopped at a scenic viewpoint to stretch their legs a bit Meita looked over at the cliffside.“That’s weird.”“What?”“I thought you said the compass blossoms usually pointed South here.”“Usually, yeah.”“That one points Northwest.”Hazal looked over at the spraypainted design. The eight pointed star was, indeed, tilted a bit. “Huh, yeah. I don’t know what that could mean.” When they got within sight of the fence boundary of Renkil Station the ArgriCorps Jedi felt like they were being observed, like there was a sense of unease about this place. She tried to brush if off. At the main entrance they were met by two guards, a grey-furred Cathar male and a Mirialan woman wearing a broad straw hat. Both had slugthrower rifles on shoulder straps poking their muzzles up behind their backs.“Hey.” The woman approached them. “Do you have business here?”“We’re looking for work. Are you hiring?”The woman retreated a few paces and spoke into the commlink attached to her shoulder. The Cathar just gave them a cool appraisal with his ears flattened down while his compatriot completed her call.“We’re not particularly looking but you can come up and try your luck. Stick to this path and you can’t miss the main house.”“Thank you.”They left the road and once over the cattle grate started down a broad unpaved well-worn path. The terrain was gently rolling here, though mountain peaks lined the horizon. The ground was covered with tan grasses along with some stunted shrubs and a few species of wildflower. It didn’t take them long before they spotted the animals, mountain nerfs with huge, peaked shoulders, curved horns, and black thick coats that were neatly trimmed except for long fringes to keep their legs warm. When they were grazing close to the path they instinctively moved on when they heard the roar of their speeder bike.After passing over pastureland they crested a ridge and there it was, a sloping valley emptying out to a winding deep blue mountain lake. Tree groves lined the shore, and they could see waterfowl and nerfs slurping up the water. There were many buildings clustered beyond the high-water mark of the lake. Steel structures surrounded by cattle pens. Huge garages. Circular brick houses for the staff with conical rooves. Most impressive was a large mansion with a brick ground level and two timber floors above.Hazal pointed it out. “That’s another sign this station has had good fortune. Not many houses here have that much wooden construction.”The station workers must have gotten he message they were coming because they waved them over to park by that building. A youngling of maybe seven or eight years came to greet them. Hazal tried not to be jealous that the boy had two lines tattooed above one eyebrow, one more than her. He was dressed in a practical button-up shirt and trousers with suspenders and had a rather serious look for someone so young.“You’re the two here for a job?”Hazal took off her helmet and gave him a smile. “Yes.”“Follow me.”He led them to the broad covered porch where three Sibian hounds were lounging around a portable radiator. They removed their boots at the little room past the entrance as not to track dirt into the house. Though a broad foyer and up the stairs. Finally they were ushered into a large office with large window along one wall and an antique desk. The man inhabiting the office was not sitting at the desk, however. He was standing next to it swaying back and forth because he had a baby in a cloth sling slung across his shoulder. He was a lean handsome man with shaggy hair and two lines of triangle tattoos running below his eyes and across the bridge of his nose, a top row pointing down interspersed with one pointing upwards. He had a casual smile but his eyes keen and dangerous.“Good afternoon, ladies. Welcome to Renkil Station. Please, have a seat. I hear you are looking for work.” He spoke soothingly, probably because of the child.The two women took their paces on upholstered chairs before the desk.Hazal took the lead. “We are. Do you happen to be hiring?”“Depends on what you can offer.”“I’m Disi. I have worked in animal husbandry my whole adult life. I can do veterinary work. I have agricultural experience. I’ve done research in ground and water disease vectors.”“Have you ever worked with nerfs?”“A little bit, recently it was Pantoran rangifer.”“And you?”“Mergina. Electrical engineering and repair. I’ve done a lot of work with speeders and appliances, mostly.”“I’m Hasad Sahibi, I’m the owner. This is my daughter, Kadri. I’ve left her all of this in my living will and since she’s the boss of me that would make her everyone else’s boss as well. That’s Enver by the door.” The boy gave them a nod. “Been a while since we had new applicants, we’re pretty remote.”Meita shrugged. “No other stations seem to be hiring.”“We are a bit short handed here these days. What do you think, Enver?”“They seem nice enough.”“How about you two try things out for a week on a provisional basis, see if the lifestyle fits. I’ll get on the coms and let the staff know. Efe is the coordinator of the herders, he can show you the veterinary station. Nehir runs the machine shop and vehicle repair bay. I know she’ll be grateful for another pair of hands.”“Thank you so much. We were starting to feel desperate. Blessings and good fortune be upon you.” Hazal gave him a bow, to which he nodded.“If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to attempt to put this one down for her nap.” They went their separate ways, getting tours of the facilities. Hazal quite appreciated the veterinary station. They might not have the most up-to-date equipment, but they were more than adequate. Efe turned out to be a burly, deep voiced, but very patient man. He introduced her to the only current full-time vet, Rezan. She had a constant sly smile and quizzed her several time on her knowledge of the equipment and procedure. She didn’t have any work for her that day but promised she could help when they brought over young bulls the next morning for vaccination, ear tagging, and castration.Meita was elated with the machine shop. Shelves and shelves of every possible tool lining the walls. Nehir was a middle aged woman with short cropped hair. She wasted no time finding a pair of coveralls that fit her and got her to work stripping the engine of a boxy cargo landspeeder. She made it clear that Mergina had to have her hair secured at all times to avoid injury so she put it up in a bun and wore a kerchief just in case.Much of the staff ate in a long communal dining hall. Dinner was nerf sausage in a curry sauce over grain mash with lots of vegetables. There they met a lot of the other workers who pressed them with questions. When things were winding down Hazal gave Meita a tug on her sleeve.“Let’s have a walk around the lake.” They walked arm in arm. When they were a distance away from everyone Hazal broke the silence.“What do you think?”“Something’s going on here.”“Yeah, there’s not a lot of farmhands and too many soldiers and mercenaries.”“How do you know that?”“It’s literally written on their faces.” She pointed to her tattoo. “A lot more people armed than is necessary to fend off predators and raiders.”“What do you think it means?”“Dunno, they could be Separatist planetary militia veterans from the war trying to start over. Something mundane like that. Could be something else. Could be anything else.”“That shirt bossman was wearing was absolutely military issue. It goes to the top whatever it is. What do you think we should do?”“On one hand work is work and hard to find right now. Maybe I should think of it as a Jedi mission. A little mystery to sort out. You don’t have to be here though if you don’t want to.”“Just try to get rid of me.”Silly town girl. “I feel better having another pair of eyes, then. Try to keep an eye out for clues.”“You can count on me, Master Jedi.”  That evening Hazal had trouble getting to sleep. She decided to slip on her parka and boots and walk over to the shrine she spotted by the lake. Some meditation and prayer might help. The night was clear with no breeze for once. Moonlight glittered off the lake. The small shrine was the only other timber structure on the property so far. Its windows had no glass and the shutters were propped open to let in the air. There was another statue to She of the Flowing Waters inside. Hazal kneeled to say a prayer then went to sit on a pew in the first row.“Hello.”Hazal tried not to yelp in surprise. She wasn’t alone. Sitting casually cross-legged nearby was a Mirialan woman. She was quite beautiful, her long dark hair barely contained under a loose-fitting headscarf. Her dress was partially unbuttoned, and she was nursing Kadri.“I was hoping I could meet you soon. My husband told me about you. Disi, is it?”“Yes.”“Afret. Pleased to meet you. I like to come here and thank the goddess for watching over us while I was growing this one.” She smoothed down Kadri’s bountiful curly hair. “Plus, it’s very peaceful out here. I am the night parent, so I don’t often get company.”A family having a day parent and a night parent during a child’s early years was a bit of an old-fashioned parenting technique that wasn’t practiced much in the cities. That explained why she wasn’t there for their informal interview. She must have been sleeping.“I would like to get to know you and your friend. I’m your employer too, after all.”“Certainly, what do you want to know?”“What brings you here?”“I was working on Pantora for many years, so I couldn’t get back during the war. I needed a homecoming and my friend wanted to see where I came from.”“Family is important to us. Are you close to your parents? Do you have siblings?”“No. Orphan, I’m afraid.”“Hopefully you’ll find comradeship at Renkil. Are the two of you together?”“Together like?”“A couple.”“Not as of yet. We’re fond of each other.”“Good to hear. Did the Republic say horrible things about us during the war?”“Mirial in particular wasn’t a regular topic of conversation. People mostly feared the droids.”“Yes, we don’t have many around here as you can see. We’re traditional like that.”“My former community was like that as well.”“But your friend is a tinkerer.”“She was a townie.”“Interesting that she would come all this way with you.” She carefully broke the child’s suction with her pinky finger and switched her to the opposite breast.“Her family ran a general store and she found it very boring.” Hazal was grateful that she didn’t need to tell many lies.“It’s good you have each other. These are tense times. Times of great change. We have to stick together.”“Definitely. Is she your first child?”“So far. You must be too young for children yet.”“Yeah. I never really thought about kids.”“It changes everything, motherhood is a big commitment. But rewarding if you have the temperament. I know it’s not for everyone.”“I can only imagine.”“I’ve taken up enough of your time and you have a big day tomorrow. You should try to get some rest. Take your friend around for dinner sometime, I would love to meet her.”“I will. Thank you, Afret.”Hazal reflected on their conversation on her way back to her bed. She seemed nice enough, but she shared her husband’s clever appraising gaze. They were being assessed. Whether it was as a potential threat or ally was unclear.




Notes:

A little note on names: I like it when Star Wars characters have regular ass Earth names. I wanted to stay away from Euro-centric ones. All my Mirialans have Turkish names since they were clearly racially coded to that part of the world. Hazal's names reference deer or doe. Some of my Pantoran names were from a name generator but others are Lithuanian. Meita means daughter, for instance.

Chapter Text
 Nehir cracked her knuckles. “Okay Miss Mergina. Tell me what is the most important system we have here on the station? Which can we never let go down?”“Umm.” Meita was drawing a blank.She tapped the device on her shoulder. “The coms! If a herder gets trampled out in the field it could be hours before we can get them to a proper medical center. We must be able to com for help at all times. The Coms Never Go Down, understand?”Meita nodded.“What’s the second most important?”Her eyes wandered around her surroundings until her eyes found the big land speeder they worked on the previous afternoon. The one nicknamed ‘The Rancor’ because of the big imposing cattle catcher on the front. “Transportation!”Nehir grinned. “Now you’re getting it my Pantoran friend. Bikes, land speeders, air speeders. We need to be able to get help to those who need it as soon as we get the call. Everything else is subordinate to those two. Power systems, irrigation, water pumps, everything. Nothing gets done around here without communications and transportation. That’s always our priority. Got it?”“Yes ma’am. I think I can get The Rancor up and running by nightfall if I work at it diligently.” Speeder repair was at least the skill she had the most experience and confidence with.“I like your drive, young one. I’ll help you out, it’ll go faster.” Hazal arrived at the vet center before she was done with her second mug of tea. She just wanted to get an early start organizing everything. Rezan was surprised to find her there first. Together they prepped the vaccine doses and lay out the ear tags on a long table. Soon the field hands where prodding the young bulls along the cattle run. This was Hazal’s first close contact with the Nerfs. In this cold weather they had less insects nesting in their pelts so while they were musky they weren’t quite as fragrant as their reputation. She found them less emotionally complex than the reindeer but easier for her to calm down utilizing the Force. Of course they still panicked a bit once they got past the hydraulic doors and into the squeeze box. But that was perfectly understandable. She then gave them their dose with a jet injector and affixed both the radio tag and larger numbered tag to one of their ears.The next part was the tough one. A robotic arm lowered the squeeze box down on its side causing the nerf to startle and try to struggle free. She stepped in and tried to calm the first one.“Just give him some time, it’s strange for them the first time. Imagine how you would feel. That’s it.” She scratched the big animal between his rolling eyes. “It’s important to consider their feelings, even when we’re about to take off their balls. You can get to it now, Disi.”Bull castration wasn’t her favorite procedure, but she knew it was important to the maintenance of the herd. She had certainly performed the procedure on countless reindeer. It went off with minimal blood loss and was easily cauterized.“Very good. You are practically an old hand at this. I can finally retire.” Hazal operated the controls to bring the box upright once more and they let their patent run free. “Now we just do all that to a dozen more and we can break for lunch.” Meita looked doubtfully down at her dinner. “What is this?”“It’s just meatloaf. Maybe a little spicier than you’re used to. Look, you put the greens and vegetables on the flatbread, then a bit of the meatloaf, drizzle it with the yogurt. Fold it. Now you’ve got a sandwich.” Hazal took a bite. “Mmm! Try it, you’ll like it!”She assembled her meal and took a tentative bite. “It’s different.”“A whole other planet, town girl.”Afret seemed to glide over to them, graceful as she was. It was after sundown so she was holding her daughter in one hand and a plate of an omelet breakfast in the other. She made her introductions to Meita who had to awkwardly swallow her last bite before responding.“I’ve heard good things about your work at the machine shop so far. You’ll go far here. Enjoying yourself?”“Like a kid in a candy store. It’s endless work but rewarding.”“Good. I’m sure you’ll fit in here. I look forward to speaking with you at the end of your trial week. Might want to switch to evening showers, however. You’ve got some grease on your lovely gold tattoos.”“Oh!” Meita took her napkin and started scrubbing the wrong cheek.Afret smiled. “Have a pleasant evening Mergina, Disi.” They walked arm-in-arm around the lake a second night in a row. Meita reminded herself that this was for appearances, and she shouldn’t try to enjoy it. It was difficult work.“So. What do you think?”“I dunno, she seemed nice.” Meita shrugged.“She seems intense. Like her husband.”“She’s got those new mom hormones. I’m sure Mirialan first time moms are kind of like Pantorans.”“Who intimidates you the most around here?”“Oh, the Cathar. Hands down. What’s his name again?”“I asked Efe so I could be as nice as possible to him. He said it’s unpronounceable to us. They just call him ‘Kedi’. Everyone else seems to get along with him. But he’s especially suspicious of us. Its that boy I’m most unnerved by. He came by to help out this afternoon as I was treating an infected cut on an old heifer. Said he wanted to be a veterinarian like me when he grows up. But he watched me instead of what I was doing. It was like a kid in a horror holo. He’s very focused.”“Did it tickle your Jedi senses or anything?”“I didn’t try. I’m only using the Force on the animals. Do you think I should try to sense him out?”“I’m just an armchair Jedi enjoyer. You’re the real deal. Up to you.”“Shouldn’t there be more kids around here?”“I hadn’t noticed.” Since they got The Rancor up and hovering Efe took Meita out to inspect and mend the fence line the next morning. Then that afternoon they traveled all over the station making sure the windmills and solar panels were functioning. He took Hazal up in a claustrophobic two-person air speeder later that week. They chased after the nerf herds looking for stragglers who might be sick or injured. Efe kept a close eye out for predators as well. Slowly the two women were introduced to all the various tasks that would be required of them in a secluded industrialized cattle station. For Hazal it was partially familiar but full of little differences form her previous life that put her on her toes. For Meita she wasn’t doing much more than she was used to back at Solitary just more off it, larger, more consequential. Both women found themselves worn out by the end of the day, but they tried to find time to exchange information. “Okay.” Meita frowned. “Theory one. They’re ex-Seppie militia. Maybe they’re planning anti-Imperial action, maybe they’re just seeking a change of life but are paranoid. Not our problem.”Hazal chimed in. “Theory two. They were Republic loyalists holed up here in the mountains. Maybe they’re Imperial paramilitary now. Very much our problem.”“Theory three. Some weird cult. Problem. Lock your doors.”“That seems remote. You’ve got holonet brain bad, girl.”“I thought you said we were blue skying at this point.”“True. Theory four. They’re just well-armed and concerned citizens hoping to be left alone. Probably the best for us. Very similar without the well-armed bit. Works out in our favor.”“I don’t have a theory five yet. I’ll work on one.”“Keep sharp and don’t loose your uncles’ number.” Hazal patted her hand affectionately. The last morning of their trail period Efe came and got Hazal. She was sterilizing some surgical equipment at the time.“You know sentient first aid as well as veterinary medicine, right?”“Yes.”“I’d like you to come with me, just in case. Some bulls got past the fence last night and we’ve got to run them down. Need you on hand in the chaser vehicle in case anyone gets hurt.”These were huge, armored land speeders, maybe military castoffs. After a brief but pleasant introduction to her driver they were off. It wasn’t hard to follow the radio tags. More difficult was running the beasts down. Hazal braced herself as the chaser vehicle menaced the bull nerf closer to the catcher vehicle. All the time all three large moving objects had to navigate though the trees. The stunted mountain trees probably wouldn’t stand up to a full impact of the armored speeders or the bull. That didn’t make it any less scary for her. When the bull got close enough a robotic arm attached to the passenger side of the hood raised up to hook around the beasts’ neck just behind the head and curved horns. Then they just had to stop in front of one of the trees without injuring the poor thing. What really amazed Hazal was the graceful way Efe looped a lasso over the enraged nerfs' head without snagging the horns, then he quickly tied it off to the tree trunk. That a man built like a gridball linebacker could have that finesse was just amazing. It was then up to her to tranquilize the bull for later transport home. Hazal almost called off the lake walk that night due to fatigue. Her friend was insistent.“So. Listen. I was in the kitchens today. The big mixer broke down. They wanted to make loads of puffed pastry for that desert we had tonight so everyone was in a panic. I spent a lot of the lunch rush down there.”“Okay.”“I swear. They’re making more food than we all consume. Something’s going on.”“What do you think it is?”“They’ve got more people here, somewhere.”“Between the two of us we’ve been to most of the buildings, Meita.”“Maybe the mansion has wings we don’t know about or something!”“And whom do you think they have hidden away?”She dropped her voice to a whisper. “Maybe other Jedi. Maybe it’s a honeypot.”“One that would only work for me in particular. I only came because I had the experience to work here and no one else were hiring. Not many other herders at the Temple.”“Okay, maybe it is Seppie high command or something. They said they all died but what if that’s just propaganda?”“Do you want to keep working here?”“Are you kidding I’m riveted. I’m having the most fun in my life and that’s not counting the mystery.”“We should focus on settling down here permanently then. Don’t rock the boat on just your imagination.”Her friend looked disappointed but relented as they continued their pleasant evening walk. That evening loud engine noises woke Hazal from deep sleep. The air speeders were buzzing about shining their spotlights across the main path. Hazal peeked out the window though a narrow gap in the curtains to see a land speeder pass by her hut. It was loaded with armed station workers. Then a civilian vehicle she didn’t recognize, its back windows all covered over in flimsy. Then another two of their speeders with armed workers. She spotted Kedi glaring over at her hut in particular checking to see if she was observing. She dropped down to the floor, her heart racing. They were heading in the direction of the mansion. Maybe Meita wasn’t paranoid after all.  Flux hated being an officer. His men were all shiny. They were just finishing up their training when The Mission was initiated so he found them to be overly literal and unimaginative when following orders. They didn’t even seem to like cutting loose after hours to have a drink or get laid. For Flux this was uncanny, strange. He missed his old platoon mates.Then there was the actual work the First Sister had them doing. So far it was just shlep over to Mirial and guard some archeological expedition. F.S. was dead set this was important to the Emperor’s vision and sure it was kind of an extension of his so-called vacation. He wasn’t doing much shooting. It was better than the war, but it was dusty and boring. His new black armor had climate control, but it just left him with spots that were too hot and joints that were far too cold. It left him in a bad mood most of the time and that just bought on the pressure in his head. Maybe he should see a medic.Another day scanning the horizon for nothing. The First Sister walked past with another basket of what looked like ancient junk and her cane held firm under her shoulder.“Chin up, Sargent. We’ll be leaving on an excursion to peruse our secondary goals for this cold little world soon.”“To be honest, Sir, I do not know what our primary goal has been.”“Mirial has the misfortune of always changing hands in galactic conflicts. Most recently the Separatists occupied it. Thousands of years past it was part of the Sith Empire on and off. Emperor Palpatine is a firm supporter and patron of archeology. The locals just abandoned this site and had no plans for research. Such a stubborn people.”“And our secondary goal? It would help to know for mission prep.”“Your clone brothers are important to you, are they not? Our secondary goal is the most personally rewarding. We are growing a family.”




Notes:

For days everyone in my household has been like ""Are you watching more YouTube videos about Australian cattle stations?"" and I have to be like ""It's for research!"" and they're like ""I miss the Sami reindeer herding documentaries, those were fun."" and I'm like ""I know, right?""

Chapter Text
   Responding to a knock Hazal hurried to her door hoping she could theorize with her friend on events of last night. And perhaps to just feel less alone, to feel like she had someone she could count on close at hand. Someone she cared for. Someone who cared for her. She was there, wearing that silly hat, her cheeks blanched a sky blue. But Kedi was also there, looming over them both. That rifle slung over his shoulder.He grumbled at her. “We would appreciate your presence to discuss your trial week and future in the community.”Hazal nods and joins his side. She tries to give a little nonverbal communication to Meita. A full Jedi might have been able to use some sort of telepathy, or at least broadcast some reassurance. She could only sense her unease. The Cathar had to leave briefly to break up an argument at the tables on the dining hall porch. One of the night shift workers had swept another’s cup away and they shouted at each other. Whatever happened last night had raised the ambient emotional temperature. Hazal stole a moment to squeeze Meita’s hand and she responded with a wavery smile.When they were escorted up the stairs of the main house Hazal struggled to reach out with her senses but could only dimly register that there were more people in the great house. Meita’s reticence and Kedi’s suspicion of them were just too blaring for her to tune out due to their proximity and immediacy. They were brought back into Hasad’s office. He and his spouse were there as well as their managers. Kadri was on a folded blanket by the window playing with a stuffed nerf. Afret looked like she was longing for sleep. She gave them a nod.Hasad spoke up first. “Good morning, ladies. I’ve heard glowing reports about your trial week. Have you decided if you would like to stay?”Hazal leaned over to whisper to her friend. “I’m about to do something rash, I’ll try to keep you out of it if there’s trouble.”“Haaaz.”She stepped forward. “We would very much like to become part of this community. But I would first like to know what is going on around here so I can best be of assistance.”There was a stark Click-Clack of a shell being loaded into a rifle behind them. “Jedi.”Afret stood a little straighter in her chair. “Kedi, stand down! I’ll handle it. You can wait outside.”Neither Hazal nor Meita dared look, but they heard the Cathar growl in response but also depart.“Afret.” Hasad looked over at his wife.“No! I’ll take care of this. You’re day parent and current day manager. When we swap in a few weeks you can take care of such matters. I’ll handle it. You run the station.” Afret got to her feet and walked over to the door. “Come with me.”They followed her down to the first floor. The sound of the stairs creaking sent little tremors of unease up Hazal’s spine. She did her best to tune it out and focus on the present, her movements, the emotional tenor of her companions. Kedi glared at them through the glass window in the front door.Meita couldn’t hold back her curiosity anymore. “Afret, why is Kedi so suspicious of us? We didn’t do anything to him.”The older woman makes a dismissive gesture. “We have been hiding our most valuable treasure down here on the first floor of the great house. He has been worried you came to burgle us. He’s grown quite attached and protective. If you wait a moment, I will show you.”Hazal was a little offended. “You know we’d never steal from you, Mrs. Sahibi.”“I had a good feelings about you two from the start. But you must realize since the Empire invaded tensions have been running high. Our normally tight-knit little community has grown a bit fractionalized.”Afret produced a keyring to open a heavy-duty oak door that closed off the rest of the ground floor from the foyer. An overhead light revealed a hallway lined on both sides with metal cabinets. Meita’s fear spiked once more when upon passing them she observed they were gun cabinets filled with E-5 blaster rifles and RG-4D pistols. Separatist weaponry.Afret paused at one of the adjoining doorways. The two women could just barely hear voices emanating from the opposite side. “You understand that by showing you what we have sought to hide away from the authorities we are letting you into our circle of trust. You two have fit in well over the last week. Your managers speak highly of you. There will be dire consequences if you betray our trust. You won’t even have to worry about Kedi. I would be the first to mete out justice. Understand?”They both nod in response. Meita broke out into a cold sweat. Afret pauses, studying the two closely, before opening the door.It was a large room filled with several rows of mismatched desks. Sitting at most of them were around a dozen Mirialan children, their skin tones ranging from chartreuse to mint green to magenta. The only one Hazal and Meita recognized was Enver who stood in the front, assisting an aged protocol droid teacher with the multimedia screen at the head of the makeshift classroom. All the windows had been painted over with whitewash and then decorated with vivid tempera paint drawings of mountaintops, majestic mountain nerfs, bit smiling suns, white puffy clouds. The younger children called out to Afret at once.“Now, now. Questions can wait. I would like to introduce Miss Disi and Miss Mergina. They have decided to join us working at the station.”They all called out a good morning with every odd an even student choosing which name to repeat. Then many of them eagerly raised their hands.Afret pointed to a young girl. “Yes, Sebil.”“Does this mean we can finally go outside?”“I am not day manager at the moment, but once you are done with this mornings’ lessons and provided you all behave… I don’t see why not.”The younlings all began discussing amongst themselves at high volume what they wanted to do once liberated from the great house. Even the sullen teenagers in the back looked relieved.“Now if you’ll excuse us I have more of the house to show to our newcomers. See you soon.”Many of them called out their goodbyes. Enver was quiet throughout the interaction, the studious boy.She closed the door and lead them into another further down the hallway. This must have been a nursery that most of the younglings had outgrown and converted into a playroom. The windows were similarly obscured and decorated. Their boss indicated some nearby chairs.“So. Now you have seen what we have been hiding.”Meita was rather perplexed. All this effort to hide away their children seemed extreme for something so mundane as having a family. Hazal was better at putting the pieces together. “They’re mostly over the age of seven, aren’t they?”“Yes.”“These are the younglings the Jedi weren’t able to train due to CIS occupation.”Afret leaned against a paint-splattered table and crossed her arms. She looked tired. “You could sense that, I guess. Enver clocked you as a fellow Force user the day you arrived. He’s probably the most astute and talented of the group. You’re partially correct. Only a few have ever had their M-count measured. The Jedi did not know about any of them. A few didn’t even have their births recorded in any registry. Totally off-the-books.”Hazal cocked her head. “Why not?”The older woman sighed and was contemplative for a moment.“The Force runs strong in my family. Not with me, or my siblings. But I have aunts and uncles, cousins, great aunts, and great uncles whom I only know from recordings from when they were toddlers. I decided at a young age that when I had children I would want a lifelong relationship with them. I just couldn’t part with my child even when she was just a possibility. I fell in love with Hazad and he felt the same way. We did some looking around and we found… an organization. Parents who felt the same way. The Northwesterners.”Meita looked over at a colorful compass blossom painted on one of the walls. It was aligned like the one they saw on the bluffs outside the station. “Northwest! Between the two goddesses of the Cosmic and Living Force!”Afret smiled. “You catch on quick. Yes. The Jedi do not kidnap children. There’s just… a social pressure. Especially on Mirial. Having a child chosen for training is seen as not only a blessing upon the family but an almost patriotic and religious duty. I had such a hard time carrying a full-term pregnancy, it would break me to give Kadri up.” She sniffs. “We’re all like that, us Northwesterners. Stubborn and selfish I guess. With the social stigma inherent in refusing the Jedi we operated a bit underground. Holonet message boards and the like. When the Separatists came, I convinced Hasad to offer up this station as sort of a refuge. We taught parents of force-sensitive children how to herd cattle. Everyone stayed under the radar. Half of us were worried that CIS high command would consider us a liability. A target of liberation for the Jedi. The other half were paranoid about the Jedi coming to take away their children for their Grand Army of the Republic and were glad. Many joined up with the planetary militia. They didn’t want the Republic coming back. The war dragged on and our numbers grew.” She gives the two friends a serious look. “Now the war is over. The Jedi are seemingly no more. But that has only made things more uncertain. Those Northwesterners who refused to leave the cities, we’ve lost contact with a lot of them. Rumors are spreading that arrests are being made. Or worse. Executions. We try to convince as many as we can to come in from the cold. I’m sure you heard the commotion last night.”They both nod.“The Empire cannot find out about us. And there are also rumors of renegade Jedi who are no longer asking but dragooning children to form them into a resistance force. I need the truth form you, Disi. If that is even your real name. Are you a Jedi?”While Meita shifted uncomfortably in her child-sized chair Hazal calmly returned Afret’s accusing stare.“Young lady, the problem you present is a political one. If you are a Jedi the paranoid third of us will wish you harm. Another third who still revere and respect the Jedi will want to defend you. The undecided remainder will be caught in the crossfire trying to restore calm. Are you a Jedi?”Hazal looked off to the corner of the room. “Barely. I washed out of the Order. I was in the Service Corps. Through random happenstance the Order lost track of me years ago.”“That explains your skill with animal husbandly. Oh! That’s perfect! We’ll say you two fell in love and ran away! Everyone is a sucker for a good love story.” She starts pacing while rubbing her chin. “That would be the best way to satisfy all parties, or at least offend the least. Don’t worry, you don’t have to make out in public or anything to maintain cover.”Meita concentrated on corralling her feelings. She could feel her cheeks turning indigo. She dared not look over at her friend. Hazal was outwardly less affected. “That’s not going to be good enough I’m afraid. The Empire will continue to assert its power. I was a nobody and they came after me. We almost didn’t make it off Pantora.”“What do you suggest?” The normally composed and elegant Afret looks desperate and forlorn for the first time.“You’re going to have to get everyone out of here. I’m sorry. I know it’s your family legacy. And the lake…”“Our wealth is not a fraction as important as our families. All the waters of Mirial would could not replace them.”Something clicked in Meita’s mind. She was grateful to steer her thoughts away form imagining kissing Hazal for a while. “I know! I have an answer to your problems.”“How so?” Afret looks surprised. Clearly the Pantoran was far from her consideration, perhaps due to her being the less affected by Imperial policies of the group.“My uncle is a pilot for the Naberrie Freight Cooperative. He’s close with their logistical officer. They could have dozens of ships on hand to spirit away your families, all the equipment you would need to start over, maybe even enough heads of cattle to get you by! And on top of that we know someone who could get you false identification in exchange for a steady supply of grass-fed free-range nerf steaks!”Afret let out a long breath. Some of the tension melts off her shoulders. “We can pray it would be that easy. Go upstairs and take it up with my husband. I am currently in desperate need of sleep.”The Pantoran woman stands and smiles brightly. “I shall. I’m happy to help as much as I can.” She looks over at her friend and feels her heartbeat surge at the warm expression she gives her in return.“I am Hazal Ahu-Aptal, by the way. This is Meita Chiran.”“It is good to finally meet you two.”    Flux tugged at the tight starched collar of his dress uniform with a gloved hand. He had no idea how officers abided this wardrobe. Part of him longed to be back on the front lines rather than be all dressed up like this. He snapped to attention when he heard the tap, tap, tap of that horrid old crones’ cane coming down the hall. With a hiss of the hydraulic door she enters and looks him up and down.“My, my. Don’t you clean up well.”“Sir. What is the occasion.”“We have a very special guest joining us this morning. She’s been though some traumatizing times and I thought you would seem a bit more friendly unarmored. Are you good with children, Flux?”“No, sir. Haven’t had much occasion to practice.”“Follow me. The poor dear. Her father put up quite the fuss when our troopers came to check in on them. The child is force-sensitive, you see. Before the war when it came time for the Jedi to collect her he sent them packing. He had tragically lost the girls’ mother in a speeder accident a few months previously and his daughter was all the family he had left. Last week he caused quite the commotion. I guess he was worried that because we put down the Jedi coup we meant to do violence against them.” The First Sister turned to look at Flux. He could just make out a wicked mirthless grin behind her lace veil.“Then we don’t mean to? Mean her harm I mean.”“Of course not. I told you before, we’re growing a loving family. Just because a child has talents does not make them a threat to our glorious Empire. We stand for order and justice, not savagery.”The old woman continued to banter as they pushed further into the military compound. “This poor girl. Her father pulled a blaster on the clones that came to check on their safety. His dispute with the Jedi made the news and we were worried those dastardly Separatists persecuted them. Hence the welfare check. They were forced to gun the man down in front of her. Poor thing was practically catatonic for a few days. I’m hoping my sparkling personality will turn her around. Do put your best foot forward, would you, Flux?”“Sir, yessir.”She led him to a sterile and joyless conference room. A girl of maybe six-to-eight Galactic Standard years sat at the table idly drawing on some flimsi. Pale yellow skin, dark hair, the girl already had  a few small circular traditional tattoos forming diagonal lines across both cheeks.The First Sister took a seat across from the girl while Flux took position standing at her right. The old woman spoke up. “Good morning, my dear. I would like to introduce you to Sargent Flux. He is one of the clone officers who keeps us all safe.”The girl stayed silent and just looked at him, thin lipped and affectless. He found her deep cobalt eyes upsetting. That thousand-meter stare. Flux had seen it many times before in his wartime comrades. A gaze void of emotion because the viewer has ceased to care, has seen to much violence. Flux saw that look in the mirror sometimes. Seeing on such a young person chilled him to the bone.“Now, now, young lady. That’s no way to be polite. Still aren’t speaking today? Understandable. I know what you have been though. We morn the loss of your family along side you. I have good news, however. I have a growing family. Wouldn’t you like to have new brothers and sisters? As a gesture of goodwill I have a new present for you.”The old woman reached into her pocket and pulled out a metallic object. It was a disk-shaped droid. The thing began to hover off her palm and extend little metal tendrils. It danced in the air mimicking a jellyfish.The girl’s eyes grew wide with wonder. She seemed to come alive. She reached out to touch the floating droid. Somehow Flux found this to be even more chilling than her shellshocked stupor.




Notes:

Sorry for the long wait! So rude to leave on a cliffhanger. My laptop had to be repaired and then it took some time to regain momentum. I hope an answer to The Mystery of Renkil Station and a cameo by the Seventh Sister will put things right again.

Chapter Text
  Renkil Station was wealthy by Mirialan standards but the holoprojector in Hasad’s office was outdated and strained to maintain connection. Tepoh’s grainy form occasionally collapsed into a waveform as the audio glitched out.“Yes, I think I can muster up that kind of carrying capacity. It will take some time to move some contracts around to other ships. They might not be able to get there at the same time. Would you consider evacuating in stages?”Hasad shook his head. He was cradling his daughter in his arms as she became fussy a few minutes ago. “That won’t work. That would mean doing things like shipping the heard or vehicles out first and they’re least priority. Our families are the most important.”“But you don’t want to just leave everything behind…”“We have to make a living somehow.”Zhe held zher elbow in one hand and tapped zher lips with the other, clearly lost in thought. “I’ll see what I can manage. I must warn you there may be levels of loss you will have to balance against survivability. This will be an expensive operation.”“Understood. And thank you.”Meita smiled as her uncle steps into frame, though that causes another glitch in the transmission. “I’m proud of you for looking out for others, poppet. Blessings of the Goddess upon you!”“Thank you, uncle! Be well!”Their holographic images blinked away. For a few beats the adults in the room brooded in silence interrupted only by Kadri.Hasad looked over at his two newest employees. We’ll have to liquidate all the assets we can in the short-term. I want you two to go out to the south fields. See if the winter wheat is ready for harvesting. After that Hazal, you shall survey the herd with Efe. Pick out which heads are ready for market. Meita, report back to Nehir and start prepping vehicles and hardware for travel. I know of some caves up in the mountains. We can take the children on a little camping trip to get them out of harm’s way.”Meita nodded. “Got it.”Hazal could not help but smile. It moved her heart to see her friend behaving so assertive and confident in the service to her people.Hasad kisses his daughter’s forehead before addressing the group once more. “Tonight, at dinner when both day and night shifts are present, I will inform the others of our plans. Now that everyone has their assignments let’s get to it!”The former AgriCorp Jedi squeezed her friends’ arm as they made their way to the motor pool. “You did good, town girl. Thank you.”Meita responded with perhaps the brightest smile she had ever seen. It was a welcome sight considering all the metaphorical dark clouds on the horizon.   Hazal tapped out commands on her datapad, giving GPS coordinates for the ripe fields so that the droid combine harvester could come in their wake. She was glad to have companionship. It was the same pristine scenery all around as when they arrived. Beautiful pink and lavender skies. High altitude clouds like lace curtains billowing in the wind. The mountains and the mesas in the distance right out of a painting. Birdcalls and the buzz of insects all around. But it just seemed colder on Renkil Station after all they have learned.“Do you think Tepoh can arrange for everyone to get out in time? Before the authorities figure out where we are?”Meita shoves her fists deeper into the pockets of her parka. “I dunno, zhe seems pretty good at organizing and delegating. They’ve got a lot of ships to pull from.”“I hope something can be worked out soon.” Hazal looks up into the sky. “We won’t know it’s too late until they are right on top of us.”“And it will be more than just one clone trooper they send over.”“Yes. They’ll come in larger numbers. You probably have a better feeling about it than I. I didn’t pay attention to the war at all.”“Yeah,” the Pantoran girl worried her bottom lip for a second. “It’s still hard for me to believe they turned on their Jedi generals after over three years of loyally fighting side-by-side.”“Meita, it’s a complicated time in a confusing Galaxy. All we can do now is trust that the Force will provide.”“In the meantime, we will do our best. Whatever we can to get by. For light and life.” The two looked into each other’s eyes and Meita just barely held back the impulse to embrace her friend in a tight hug.  Efe and Hazal spent the long afternoon flying a skyhopper around scanning the radio tags of adult nerfs that seemed healthy and ready to send to auction. They flew back to the simple structure that the herders used for a hangar. She felt her anxiety spiking now that she didn’t have a task to keep her occupied. So she opened up some conversation.“So is one of those kids yours?”Efe shrugged. “Nah. I never got the urge to pair up with someone and get wed. I’m one of the herders who was here before they started this little sanctuary. Hasad is the closest I’ve got to a kid. Started working for his mother when I was younger than you are now, back when she was the big boss.”“So you know a lot of the Sahibi family?”“Know them better than my own kin.”“And what do you think of the Northwesterners?”“For city folk most of them took well to the lifestyle. There were a lot of political arguments at first. I guess that was happening all over. We’ve got such an ingrained respect for the Force. Many didn’t want to sever with the Republic. Others were dyed in the wool Seppies. The children were all that kept us from taking arguments over drinks to fistfights. Their love for the kids was the binding agent that got us though some turbulent times. They bombed a lot of the cities. Did you know that?”“No. I was running with some traditionalist herders over on Pantora. I didn’t follow the war hardly at all. We were blockaded for a bit but that was the Trade Federation, not strictly the CIS.”“Mirial suffered but persevered, like we always do. Changing hands in practically every war. A steppingstone for larger powers. But the Goddesses see us trough. Lifegiving waters and star-spun wisdom. Our people are survivors, AgriCorps. Never forget who you are and where you come from.”Hazal nodded and took his words to heart.  Meita and Nehir packed tools and replacement parts into plastoid crates until their shoulders and arms ached. When they were done for the day the older woman approached with cans of beer in each hand.“Heads up, Blue!” She tossed one at her.Meita caught and opened it. “Cheers.”“How do you say it in Pantoran?”“Tavo sveikatai!”She laughed. “Can’t manage that, sorry. Iyi tezahurat!”They favored light ales made with their winter wheat on Mirial. Meita missed the dark lagers of her home but she didn’t complain. Beer was beer and not to be snubbed at the end of a day of labor.“You're sticking with her, huh?”Meita blinked. “What?”“Your girl. This isn’t your fight. You weren’t a Jedi, right?”“No. I just admired them. I admired her.”“You could just walk away if you wanted. Maybe your girl would be at ease knowing you’d be in a safe spot.”“Yeah, but I’d have to deal with the guilt. Hazal has spent her whole life in service to other people. To my people. It’s about time someone stuck by her side and helped her out. A little kindness in this cruel universe after all this war and death.”Nehir chuckled to herself.“What?”“You two are cute together. I’m a big sucker for two kids in love.” She raised her can again. “Aska ve sevgiye!”She didn’t know what she was toasting to but Meita went along, smiling and feeling the stirring in her chest.  Before dinner Hazad stole away to the little wooden temple to make some early evening prayers. She found Hasad and Kadri there.“You’re religious like your wife?”“Of course. The Goddess blessed my family with mountain streams leading to this lake. Brought us through drought and all sorts of clamorous times.” He looks over at the statue. “I’m not the most devout, but I like to come here to think. It’s a bit like prayer.”“May we repay her blessings with generosity and kindness.” It was an old Mirialan aphorism.They worshiped in silence for a while until Hazal rose from her kneeling position and sat back at a pew.“What was it like at the temple?”“The Jedi Temple?” she sighed. “I was always leading with the wrong foot. I was a nervous child. It seems like I didn’t have much self confidence until I was 15 and started working with animals and paying more attention to science than the metaphysics of the Force. I failed then found something I was actually good at.”Hasad’s handsome features when solemn. “Weird to think that it’s gone. I spent so much effort keeping my daughter from being sent to that temple. But now it’s not an option. Any Jedi who could teach her is on the run.”“You’ll just have to teach her how to be a Sahibi rather than a Jedi. Teach her to be a child of Mirial, to honor her ancestors and their ways.”“You really do speak like someone who learned far more from Pantoran rangifer headers than Jedi masters. There must be a universal knowledge base for those sentients who work the land alongside great beasts. You might as well have been channeling my grandmother there.”She smiled. “I’ll take that as a compliment.” 




Notes:

Just a short one this week as these two sort of reset with the community they found before trouble finds them.

Chapter Text
  Meita spoke a kilometer a minute despite her fatigue telling Hazal about her day. A few days previously they sent their largest container transport full of nerfs out to the wholesale market and it arrived back piled with transport containers. She and Nehir sort all the tools and hardware into categories: essentials, nice-to-have, and can-be-left-behind and then subcategorized them by size for ease of packing. Today was spent getting everything into crates, the crates into palates, and the palates lifted over to the containers. Even though the tough last step was done with forklifts someone still had to pack the crates. Meita was sore all over.And hungry. She tore into the evening meal which turned out to be a rice dish soaked in clarified butter with roasted vegetables, nuts, bits of nerf steak of course, and all the local spices that Meita still could not name but had adjusted her palate to enjoy. Her friend was a good listener throughout all this but during the meal Meita grew concerned.She addressed her concerns on their after-meal walk. She was tired but needed the exercise to tamp down her evening meal. “Something’s wrong, what’s wrong?”“It’s probably nothing.”“And may be something. What’s on your mind?”She pursed her lips. Meita has been in such a good mood since coming up with their relocation solution. She was hesitant to burst her bubble. “Did you enjoy the meal?”“Delicious, yes.”“Rice.”“Yeah, so?”“It’s a common export for Pantora. There are rice patties all over the equator. On Mirial things can have symbolic meaning. You’ve been flagging all the hardware we won’t need. The Sahibis are selling anything they can for seed money when we start over on another planet. Rice is a luxury item here. To grow it you need a greenhouse and,” she gestured over to the lake, “lots of water. To feed us all that meal took many bags of rice. Could have gotten them a fine premium even in this postwar market.”“Okay… So? What is the symbolic meaning?”“That’s the sort of dish you serve at a wedding celebration, or to heroes before a big battle.”Meita look out to the horizon. Her brows knit together. Her gold eyes were wide. “I see.” She remembered the blaster bolts singing past her on their flight from Devotion. “Hazal.”“Yeah?”“Could you stay with me tonight? Like on Pantora?” She would feel a lot safer if she had a Jedi close by.“Yeah, I would like that too.”Hazal was never one to have prophetic visions or dreams but that night she beheld the entire Galaxy. She felt a wave of great sorrow as perhaps nine out of ten of the stars winked out. A few more followed, snuffing at random. There were so few now. Her attention centered on a cluster of nebulae. Here was a stellar cradle with new stars just starting life or waiting to be born guarded by a lone and dim brown dwarf. So precious, so precarious. There was a black hole approaching. The next morning she was left with a lingering feeling of dread.   Flux sat at his desk in what was supposed to be officers’ quarters at his base at Kaide Planita. A lot was on his mind. F.S. had let him know this morning his squad of shinies better be ready to move soon so he’d have to get them combat-ready. Another ‘wellness check’. Intelligence on this mission was sketchy. Maybe this was a wild convor hunt. He hoped it was.He drummed his fingers and thought about if he really wanted to do this. There was a bottle of cheap grain alcohol nearby just in case. He switched on his comms unit and punched in Durant’s code.After a few rings he answered. “W-what is it?”“How’s my little friend? Damn, you’re in bed? What time is it over there?”“Four or so in the morning?”“Where’s your shirt? Do you sleep in the nude or something? You’re even skinnier than I thought!”The digital forensics technician pulled his sheets over his chest. “Again, what is it?”“First Sister wanted me to give you a call. Do you have some way to delete information off the networks?”“I could set up a worm or something.”“Worm? Are we gardening now?”“Flux.”“She wants information on that little ditch-digger classified. She wants to keep the only files. Burn her. Then send whatever you make over to me and I’ll do the same. Make the instructions user-friendly. Can you do that? You don’t want her coming over to haunt your attic or whatever.”“Yeah, sure. I’ll get back to you.” He was already fumbling with sleep-weary fingers to kill the call.“Sleep well then, little librarian!” The screen went black. “Well, that was easy.” He unscrewed the bottle and drank down a few gulps.He was getting better at this. This time his head hardly felt like it was exploding.   Go time. Do or die. Just a matter of hours now the sky will be full of transports.Meita was still rattled but at least she and Haz had gotten closer the last few days, sharing a room right before it was time to move off Mirial. She’d miss the place. At least she was taking a bit of its people with her. She and several farmhands prepped a staging area for equipment. Nearby the ground vehicles were getting lined up in a neat row. Things were coming together.Anyone not engaged with last minute cargo preparation were spread out around the periphery of the station on sentry duty ready to report any incoming ships. Hasad, still day manager, seemed to constantly be issuing orders over the coms. He paced around and oversaw everything with his daughter babbling in her sling.She looked over at the cattle pens where Hazal was overseeing the livestock. Maybe we can make this happen. Maybe they’d get away without a hitch. Flux brooded as he swayed along to the gunship’s maneuvers. He heard talk the LAATs were being replaced eventually. He ran his textured gloved fingertips over the hull. How many hours had he spend in these? On how many planets?The old crone was giving a motivational speech to his men which he was stubbornly tuning out. Something about the glory of the Empire, stability, order. Whatever. Why are you sending ‘Purge Troopers’ to a wellness visit? At least do the dignity of calling this wet work what it is. But what did nat-borns know of clone dignity? He took his mind away from this unpleasantness by trying to remember the name and number of ever sergeant he ever served with, every lieutenant, every commander. Every general. His temple throbbed but this time there was little pain.His men studiously checked each other’s armor, then their own weaponry. Flux was going to make sure this mission would go by the book. No matter how unpleasant. Even if he didn’t vibe with his men. Or that horrible officer. At least he was able to save one of them. Meita overheard Hasad’s com chirp. “Contact! Contact! There’s a gunship coming in from the south!”He reached to his shoulder to respond. “All pickets withdraw to the main compound and get ready to repel them.” He scanned around the workers. “Kedi! Come here, please.” The big Cathar sprinted to him. With one hand Hasad lifted his daughter up and away while looping the sling over his head with the other. “Take her to our bedroom and watch after them.” Kedi gave him a grave nod, shouldered his rifle, and hurried away with the child.Once Meita had shrugged off her anxiety she went to her friend. “What do we do?”“You know how to shoot a rifle, right?” She grew up on the tundra, of course she did. The Pantoran nodded. “Get one and come back here with Greatstorm.”There was a sputter and high-pitched whine as one of the skyhoppers blew up a cloud of dust while lifting off the ground. Hasad was shouting into his coms demanding to know who was at the controls No one knew. Stuttering pings of small arms fire reverberated throughout the cabin. Spirited but pitiful, Flux thought.One of the pilots got on the intercom. “Ma’am, one of the civilian crafts is in the air.”The First Sisters’ expression was unreadable behind her veil and her stance remained loose. “Open fire if it is armed. Someone get on the tail gun.” The gunship made a low pass over the station’s main buildings. Then the skyhopper began harassing it with laser fire. Lasers designed for targeting predatory animals. Hazal watched the doomed endeavor and said a prayer. Soon her friend was back both armed and on her speeder. Just in time to see the gunship take one shot at the skyhopper, a solid hit on hits starboard side. It jerked in the air but didn’t loose control though it was trailing smoke and flames. Whomever was at the controls engaged the full throttle and smacked against the wing of the LAAT. Its port engines protested, erupted, and the craft went into a spin. Soon both craft impacted with the loamy grasslands below. The hills hid them from sight except for the trails of dark smoke rising into the sky.Hazal’s heart dropped. “I hope that wasn’t Efe.”She felt her friend’s hand clamp onto her upper arm. “Haz! If I die don’t let them bury or burn my body, drown me in the lake, please, it will be the only way my soul will make it to the afterlife!”She gave her a sympathetic look. She knew Pantoran burial rituals well enough and beliefs about the Drowned God. “You’re not going to die today, Mei. Can you do something for me?”She nodded.“Take Greatstorm over to where the clones are but then get to cover behind a hill. Fire up into the air so I know where they are. I’ll come to you. Can you do that?”A slower nod this time.“You can do this.”She licked her lips  and looked concerned then sped away. “There you are, get your feet under you.” Miraculously there were no casualties, though Flux’s men were a bit banged up. He helped the second pilot steady himself. The First Sister hadn’t waited, she was leading His men away from the LAAT over to the main compound. At least moving at the pace of an elderly woman gave them time to recover. A few blaster bolts streaked out from the periphery of the surrounding hills. Red bolts, he thought. They’ve got Seppie guns. There was a wave of bad memories of battle. He felt a little surge of pride seeing his men take regulation firing positions. He may not have bonded with these shinies but at least they’ve been trained well. Meita took her bike just to the crest of a hill and by the time it came to a stop she already had her slugthrower up and firing at the black armored men in the trough of the valley. She didn’t recognize the unit, must be new. She risked a half dozen rounds before letting the gun hang on its shoulder strap and roaring off. Flux recognized that bike, it was that blue girl! The one who was no doubt plowing that AgriCorps fargirl’s field. This is the thanks he gets for doing someone a good turn. He drew one of his sidearms and directed his men’s aim. One of the Mirialan snipers cried out when they clipped her. They may be outnumbered but even an inexperienced clone force is to be reconned with.The old woman hadn’t gone down on one knee like his brothers. She was just standing there observing. Maybe he’d end up in command of his team with an officer that reckless. Then she turned her head and raised a hand to signal caution.“Something is coming.”She was right. Flux heard a rumbling sound and could feel vibrations in the soles of his boots. He squatted and looked around for its source as his brothers took care of the last of the bothersome cattle workers. The sound reached a crescendo as the dark shapes of great horned mountain nerfs crested one of the surrounding hills. That girl, that blasted Agricorps washout was perched up on the back of the lead nerf, her hands desperately clutching the fur of its high-backed hump, her heels dug into its side. Flux couldn’t help but chuckle at the terrible sight. He didn’t care if it went over the coms.  Hazal nearly lost her grip. A sickly sour sensation almost overcame her. Maybe she was particularly receptive because she was straining, reaching out with the Force to guide the herd. She’d never sensed the dark side this potently. There was a downright evil Force user amongst this strike team. She aimed the beasts towards the officer wearing the grey uniform and cape. To her shock the old woman leapt like a Terrelian Jango Jumper, probably right over the whole herd. She’d have to circle back for that one. She grimaced as she felt the crunch of hooves pummeling down on clone armor. Even if these clones had killed almost all her kin didn’t mean they weren’t sentient beings in tune with the Living Force. She had to do what she had to do. There were some other troopers further downfield, one wearing some sort of a skirt. He fired a few bolts into her mount’s hide causing it to bellow in pain. Sorry, big guy. When they got to that one her nerf batted him away with a swipe of its curved horns. It was hard to steer the huge beasts. She maintained her touch of their minds, guiding them in a broad curving gallop for a second round. A few of the men were still moving around. And there was that woman. Cap long gone; she got a good look at her. She had purple wrinkled skin but didn’t seem to be a Mirialan. Whatever her species she had to be ancient. Her tight hair bun had partially come loose, allowing some white and grey strands to wave around in the wind. She was giving Hazal a hateful grimace of rage. Worst of all were her bloodshot yellow eyes. She almost lost her nerve. She nearly had the old woman beneath the nerf’s hooves when a red saber blade extended out of her cane and she deftly cut the beast’s front legs out from under it. Hazal was thrown to the ground, but her Jedi foresight warned her to roll off to the side to avoid being crushed by a half ton of mortally wounded nerf.She got to her feet and leaned to the left, dodging the red blade. Then she ducked. It only roasted off some of her hair. For once in her life the Force sang though her as she evaded swipe after swipe. The woman held the blade like a spear and thrust toward her but she sidestepped. With a desperate backwards lean she avoided being cleft in two but there was a long cut in her tunic just below her collarbones. She could feel blisters start to welt. The crone lost her patience and with a gesture Hazal felt a crushing pressure around her throat.Then the old woman spun around, directing the lightsaber to intercept slugs fired at her even before the sound of shots reached their ears. She did let out a snarl when molten bits of metal hit her face. She directed the hand she used to choke Hazal, shoving the air in the direction of her attacker. Letting out a little yelp Meita was shoved off her bike.That gave Hazal a window to clamp down her hands on the long hilt of the saber cane. Her eyes went wide as the woman tossed her off her feet. She kept her grip. The dark side was powerful in this foe. They wrestled for control, the blade letting out ominous noises far too close to Hazal’s ear for comfort. She kicked the Imperial hard as she could in her stomach, then threw her weight backwards. The woman managed to angle the impact into her shoulder rather than head. For a while they struggled on the ground for control of the weapon. Small fires shouldered in the places where the blade bit into the ground. After regaining consciousness Flux watched the melee play out. He rolled onto his belly, absolute agony. Though it hurt like all the Corellian hells he could still breathe. So at least he didn’t have a punctured lung. He had his sidearm, the one he hadn’t dropped, in his off hand without him thinking to draw it. He waited to see if he needed to cause death.
Good soldiers, good soldiers.
 The horrible Sith straddled the younger woman and attempted to twist the saber out of her grip. But Hazal was physically stronger from a lifetime of outdoor labor. Sweat was making her grip precarious but with gradual advances she managed to jerk the blade towards her foe. It bit into her shoulder and the Sith let out a horrible howl of pain and anger. Hazal deactivated the thing and tossed it away, then shoved the limp body off herself. She was getting to her knees when she heard Meita calling her name. She was sprinting towards her. All the sudden she skidded to a stop with a terrified look on her face. Hazal turned to see the Sith struggle to a kneel, the saber flew with a slap into her gloved uninjured hand and hummed when activated. His head felt like it was splitting open. Flux knew it would only cease once he had killed a Jedi. He forced himself to believe a lie. The Jedi would be the one holding the lightsaber, right? Scored a hit right at the base of her neck, would have earned him top marks back in training. The relief of pressure paired with the flush of dopamine and steep drop of blood pressure he felt caused him to black out once more.The two women looked at the now dead officer, then over to the clone who had saved Hazal for whatever reason. Meita rushed over to kneel next to Hazal and picked frantically at her clothes. “Are you hurt? Are you okay?”“I’ll be fine.”Meita still let out little concerned noises looking Hazal over for injury. Then she gave her a tight hug before kissing her cheek once, twice. She realized what she was doing and released her grip. She recoiled away. “OH! I’m sorry I’m sorry I didn’t mean to.”Hazal smiled and shook her head. “Silly town girl…” She slipped a gentle hand behind Mei’s neck and planted a deep kiss right on her lips and kept it up until Meita relaxed, swooned towards her, and kissed her back. Hazal drew back a little to admire her. Meita had her eyes closed, her lips full and mouth lightly parted. Her big golden eyes fluttered open and they just shared the moment for a bit.Then the Jedi remembered her responsibilities. She got to her feet and took the Pantoran’s hand. “Come on, lets go.” She led her friend, now perhaps more than friend, along on a jog towards where the skyhopper crashed. “Hey, do you want to get married and when we’re old women and this Empire thing has blown over retire to a goat farm on Aldhani and sell artisanal cheeses? It’s my dream!”Meita’s vision was blurring so she blinked away the tears. She answered though a broad smile. “YES!”“Good!” She gave her a wink and continued their run. Once they crested the nearest hill a broad shadow swallowed them up. It was cast by a huge bulk freighter. The Naberrie Collective fright flotilla had finally arrived.  




Notes:

Epilogue coming soon.I'm still not going to tag her but for posterity the Fist Sister is Lene Kostana from Dooku: Jedi Lost. She's an archeologist of Sith relics and therefore would be susceptible to falling to the dark side. Dooku would have had Sheev recruit her as an Inquisitor. He had a big ol crush on his goth teacher.










Chapter 23



Notes:
This is the ending! I did not make it to 50,000 words or have it completed by December but I am happy with hit. I hope you enjoyed reading.




Chapter Text
 He eventually found himself slipping in and out of consciousness. It was like a bad dream. At times he felt it would be better if he had slipped away. After a near eternity he gets his eyes to almost focus. He didn’t know where he was but it wasn’t an Imperial medbay.He groped around to find something to hang on to so he could sit up but only managed to knock something off a table. That’s when he heard voices. The clone braced himself for a fight.A scruffy old Pantoran arrived… wherever he was.“Hello, soldier. Do you remember where you are?”He grunted a no.“Figures, those Mirialans pumped you up with a lot of painkillers. And they mostly had nerf tranquilizers on hand. You’re onboard the Merganser, that’s my ship.”“Why?”“After we found you alive, I made a call to an old boyfriend of mine, you spoke a while ago. The veterinarian. He seemed to think maybe you’d appreciate a career change.”“To what?”“Coordinator of merchant marines working security for a freight cooperative?”Flux swallowed, his throat was dry. “First, I’m going to need a real vacation. And to never see a Jedi again for as long as I live.”     Meita felt sunlight on her eyelids. Dappled sunlight due to the Dlaba tree outside their window. She opened her eyes and took a moment to admire Hazal’s jawline. She could see a little of her dark lips. She took a moment to enjoy the warmth, snuggled up against the woman she loved. Then she removed her arm that was wound around Haz’s torso and poked at the circular tattoos on her right temple. One, two, three. Hazal scrunched up her eyes and grumbled.“Haz, it’s morning.”Her companion turned her head towards the pillows. “Lichen, it’s a school day. You have younglings counting on you.”School days are also the days she doesn’t have to wake up early for farm work. “Enver can teach them, he’s three times more talented than I am.”“Enver is a sullen teenager who hates public speaking.” She gives her a kiss on the cheek. “Come on, you have responsibilities.” Meita was right. She had to teach the youths how to use the Force so they knew how not to use the Force and hide from the authorities. Somehow the Service Corps laborer had become an instructor.Meita rose from bed and with a sweep of her arm took the sheets with her. Hazal didn’t want to open her eyes, but she never passed up an opportunity to admire her wife’s curvy backside.They went through the familiar domestic tasks preparing for their day. Refresher and dressing. Caf and conversation. Meita knotted her kerchief at the base of her neck and gave her one last kiss on the cheek. “You ready?”“As I’ll ever be.”She opened the front door. There was their community. A Little Mirial. They both found summers on Dantooine unpleasantly hot, but they had adjusted. Pastureland was cheap and plentiful. It had been an easy transition. They part ways. Half way to the common house that doubles as a classroom Hazal is waylaid by Kadri who ceases drawing in the dust with a stick to hurry over in that splayed-armed gate that toddlers use.“Teacher, teacher! I’ve gotta show you something I’ve gotta show you something I’ve gotta show you something.” She has that serious look in her eyes that young children get, that what they need to say is the most important thing in the Galaxy.Hazal has been trying to use music as a way to calm rambunctious children. She takes a slow intake of morning air and sings. Kadri looks back at her and smiles. As she leads Hazal by two fingers down the road to show her whatever was of upmost importance she joins her in song.Sometimes she is even on key."

You walk behind the different posts, repressing a yawn. The shift is almost over, you think, contain yourself. You lazily observe the different screens flashing before your eyes, feeling your eyelids close themself. You shake your head.“Stand up straight and work hard!” You order to the whole bridge, but it is more aimed at you to wake you up.You still see some backs of some ensigns straighten up, and some postures stiffening. You grin at yourself. Ah, the young ones… You like their naivete overflowing with ardor, but you still prefer the calmness of your elders. They are more posed and less stressed.You turn on yourself, observing your surroundings before heading towards the Rear Admiral Marttilf.“How is it going Lieutenant commander (y/l/n)?” He demands“Everything’s fine sir, we should be out of hyperspace in two minutes.”“I hope your info isn’t wrong and we will find something at the destination!”“They have all my trust, sir.” You clasp your hand behind your back.You got those info thanks to the network of your grandparents, it served them well for decades. You hope it can do the same for you now.You observe the rays of light as you fly at lightspeed, you've always liked this spectacle, so impressive and magical. It must have inspired so many artists. Your mind wanders back to Vez and his exposition, you should bring a friend with you if you ever get to see it.""Destination reached in 15 seconds !"" Warns the steerman officer.You stiffen, ready to discover what the universe will throw at you. But most of all, ready to discover if you’re right. Marttlilf gives you a side look. The trails of light stop and the Zephyr comes to a halt… In the middle of a complete armada.“That’s them!” You yell, pointing at an enormous ship in the middle of the battle “That must be their mothership!”A multitude of smaller ships fly around it, surely proceeding to some exchanges and charging their hold with slaves and other assets of the empire. You couldn’t let them do that! You may be just one ship but you’re as massive as their mothership, plus with Thrawn’s plan it should go well.“Alright, weapon officers get ready, we’ll act according to the plan!” Marttlif speaks with a confident voice.Already, a line of enemy ships form in front of you. You remember Thrawn’s plan, you hope it will really work. You notice the mothership is tilting on the side.“They’re about to escape! Steerman, prepare for another jump in hyperspace!” you order.“We’re going nowhere! We have more pressing matters in front of us!” the Rear Admiral contradicts.“Sir! With all due respect, the mothership should be our priority, we can cross past them and hunt their mothership!” You argue.“They will disperse and create different cells if we cut their heads! We stay here!”Why doesn’t he understand? It is your one chance.“They will be disorganized and weakened if we blow them now!”“Enough!” He raises his voice and you shut your mouth immediately. He shoots you a glare, eyebrows frowned. “We’ll stay and cut  them off from their armed wing. I will not tolerate insubordination Lieutenant commander! If you're not able to listen to an order, I will have you escorted to a cell. Am I clear?”You bite your inner cheek, he makes the call but deep down you know you’re right. Thrawn’s plan was supposed to be applied to the head of the hydra, but you won’t be able to use it twice. The rest of the crew is looking at you both, not knowing what to do. The officers Sealan and Norcaus approach, unsure how to interrupt the “discussion”“It won’t be necessary, sir.” You admit, swallowing back your pride.You take a step back, lowering your head slightly.“Good…” his tone is icy cold.You shoot him daggers in his back, but fortunately for you he doesn’t see. Sealan and Norcaus exchange a glance. As you look out by the glass wall you see their mothership just do a 180° turn and is ready to jump in hyperspace. Too late for this one. All it rests to do is focusing on the line approaching you.“Officers, get ready to deploy!” He announces.Everyone gets busy behind their consoles, taping away commands and calibrating differents aims. You observe the ships approaching, five, side to side, pressed against the others. You’ve never seen a maneuver like that… They are way too close to do anything without risking obliterating the other…A flash of comprehension strikes your mind.“Steerman ! Avoidance maneuver, NOW!” You yellYou turn back to the glass wall to see them spread and a black mass charging at the Zephyr at maximum speed.“AVOID! AVOI-” _____________________________________________ You open your eyes suddenly. You only see a white ceiling and feel a jackhammer inside your head. You whine as the light hurts your eyes, you slowly turn your head to see a meddroïd in front of monitors. You extend your hand, only to see you’re transfused, you follow the tube with your eyes, from your hand to the pocket of transparent fluid slowly instilled in your body.With difficulty you raise yourself to place the pillow and rest in a seated position rather than laying. The meddroïd notices you’re awake and tends to you immediately. The door shuffles and someone enters the room.“Ha! We’ve been told there was a chance you would wake up soon!”You raise your head to the bright smile of Eli. You let out a deep sigh of relief and he hugs you with a chuckle. You stay immobile a second, the memory of him kissing Nather flashing in your mind, you simply move him aside with a contrite smile.“Eli… I’m so happy to see you."" You lie ""Where am I?”“You are on the ISD Chimaera.” He enters. You instinctively pull the cover over you. “Welcome aboard Lieutenant Commander (y/l/n).” Thrawn greets you.“Thank you.” You respond, still stunned.You suddenly feel self-conscious of your bruises, of the pillow mark on your cheek, of your ruffled hair. You straighten your back in an effort to appear dignified despite everything.“How are you feeling?” Eli asks, pulling a seat to sit next to your bed, Thrawn preferring to place himself at the footboard.“I’ve seen better days…” You admit “How’s the Rear Admiral Marttilf?” You demand, suddenly remembering what happened.“He’s alive. Albeit a bit shocked.”You nod.“And what about the rest of the crew?”“Some did not make it, unfortunately.” Thrawn shakes his head slowly.You lower your head, thinking back of the ensigns and new recruits that joined you recently. How will their family learn the news? You take a fistfull of the sheets, digging your nails into the fabric.“Some had more chances.” He gestures next to you.You turn your head to see two other beds, you lean forwards to see Sealan and Norcaus, lying and transfused as you are, but Norcaus has a respirator on his face and each breath sounds painful. Sealan opens an eye and weakly waves at you with her hand, probably too exhausted to do otherwise. You wave back with a little smile. She closes her eyes, going back to sleep with the soothing beeping of the machines.“We need to ask you some questions about what happened, (y/l/n). Hear your version of the facts.” Thrawn inquires with a soft tone.“Well… They hid a corvette behind a line of ships that feigned an attack against us and propelled it max power against the Zephyr. It hit us through the cockpit and destroyed everything on its way. I can’t tell much, I lost consciousness at that moment.”Eli took out a datapad and searched through it, verifying the facts. He slowly nods.“That is where we received a distress message on our way back to Coruscant.” Adds Thrawn. “Do you have any memory of what happened earlier?”“We discovered their mothership. They were charging goods and slaves on other ships, probably the delivery ones. A lot of them were permitted to leave the scene. We lost time by my fault and it escaped.” You admit.“What happened?”“I pleaded for an attack against the mothership while Rear Admiral Marttlif decided to destroy their armed guard.”“Both strategies have their merits.” He simply states. “Can you indicate to us the models of ships used?”Eli gives you the datapad. Your hands brush and you feel a spike of anger at that simple contact. You pull the datapad out of his hands with an hectic move while he looks at you in surprise. You rummage through the different models and enter what you remember. You give it back to Eli without looking at him.“Can you extract information from these new data?” Thrawn asks him.He looks through it.“Maybe, I will need to cross-examine other data too, but I’m positive I can find something.” He stands up and salutes Thrawn. “Sir, Lieutenant commander (y/l/n).”You address him with a polite smile that you hope appeared sincere, looking at him exit the room. You sigh, letting yourself bounce on the pillow.“What a dramatic sigh. Is something wrong?” Thrawn politely asks.“Nothing you can do about…” You say letting your gaze travel aimlessly, but whatever you do, it always comes back on Thrawn.“Maybe. I cannot offer my help if I don’t know what is happening.”“It’s my problem, I shouldn't bring you into this.”He comes closer, you first thought he would sit on Eli’s stool but he sits down at the edge of the bed, your hand almost grazing his thigh. You retract it. Better not touching him, you think, it is confusing enough as it is. You refuse to admit it, but your love for him is still here, intact and untouched.And it scares you.Will you end up like Nather and Eli?You hope you’re worth more than that.Thrawn pulls out a comlink out of his pocket and hands it to you.“Here. It has not stopped ringing since we found it back.”You take it to see several people from the church called you, just as an impressive amount of calls from Nather. This doesn’t bring you joy as it usually does. It must show on your face, cause Thrawn picks it up immediately.“You do not appear happy for someone who is missed by people.”“I know, it’s just… He’s part of the problem.” You don’t really have the energy to face him, right now.“Maybe you could share that problem with a friend.” He proposes.You chuckle.“And who that might be? You?”“Perhaps.”“Are you experienced in counseling couples going through hard times like mourning or cheating?”“I will have to say no.”“Then you're not the right friend.” You smile tiredly “But I appreciate your thoughtfulness. It is agreeable to know we can count on friends.”He simply nods.“Then maybe Lieutenant Karyn Faro may be of better help. I can indicate to her you’re awake once her shift is finished.”You open your eyes wide.“Karyn works with you?”“Since she is a Chief Warrant Officer, you did not know?” He appears surprised.“I’ve lost touch with so many people.” You admit. “Now my relationships are primarily my friends at church.”He raises an eyebrow and brings his hand to his chin.“Does this happen often in human society?”“What do you mean?“To devote oneself to one community to the point of losing tracks of the others parts of your life?”You scoff with a grin.“You make it sound so bad. I just give my time to an organization that promotes peace between the races. It isn’t that terrible when you put it in perspective. Plus they gave me a pretty name.” You flash him a joyful smile.He just nods without adding anything, but you see behind his eyes his thinking.“You should try it sometimes, it works for the equality of the races under the Empire rule. You would surely find another person in your condition.”“I thank you but I am not of the spiritual type. And I like to advance by my own means.” He politely declines“Your own means? Don’t you need that Governor Prace to help you at each of your missions?”“Governor Pryce. And I do not need her at every mission.” He corrects, one finger up. “I merely need her when politics come mingling in the affairs of the Navy.”“So you need her at every mission, that's what I said!” You laugh and you see his lips stretch in a smile.As you continue chuckling your hand lands on his. You don’t realize, only noticing when he starts caressing it with his thumb.You let him do it against your conscience yelling at you to not tolerate even innocent touches. You look at him observing your bruised hand, his warm skin warming up your hand. You gulp.“Sir?”“Yes?” He looks at you with what looks like tenderness in his gaze. But you can't be sure.“Could I get a datapad? I would like to do some research.”He opens his vest and takes out his own datapad that he hands to you.“I will get another one.” He simply states.You gratefully take it.Your comlink starts ringing. Both of your eyes get down to the infuriating cylinder. It’s Nather.“Is it the problem?” He asks with a little grin.You nod, contrite. He stands up straight and salutes you.“Then I will leave you here. Due to the damages done to the Zephyr you will be placed under the order of the Admiral Konstantine that operates in the Lothal region. You will take your post in two months.”He heads towards the door, but you stop him. You have to know.“If you would have been at my place, you would have gone for the mothership?”He eyeballs you in silence.“From what I know? Yes. Most probably.” He nods to you and exits.You bounce back on the pillow. So you were right.You breath deeply.“Yes?”“Maker Roween! Where the fuck are you?! You stopped responding!” Nather is really pissed off.“I’m in a hospital bed.”“You… Oh dear Maker, are you okay?” His tone shifted immediately to worrisome. “I am sorry, I am a bit mad. It’s just… You stopped responding so suddenly, I thought I was in trouble or something.”You smile, tired.“No love.” This word leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. You will need to confront him about the kiss one day “Everything is good. I’m mostly okay, I should be able to go out in two days? Something like that, do not worry.”“I know what could make you feel better. You didn’t attend one of my famous dinners yet, yes? It will make you back on your feet! What do you think?”You remain silent, you don’t have the energy to face him or any of your friends at this moment.“Sure, love. If you think it could help me…” You lie.“It would do you good to see some friends, real ones I mean. You’re always the head full with those pesky relationships at work, you’d do well to forget them a little and reunite with people that care about you.”You nod.“Alright, I’ll do that.”“Good. Then I will let you rest now. Come back to me all healed.”“Bye love.”He cuts.You turn on the datapad, determined to get the last word. Where to start ? Crossing the data to determine the destination of some of those delivery ships? No.You’re gonna investigate Marttlif first. You will need to contact your informant in the underworld too._____________________________________________________ You make your spine crack, carrying those boxes around all day is daunting even for someone as athletic as you, plus your healing bruises don’t help. You open your window and breathe the fresh air. The air of the superior floors is definitely more healthy than the one at your former apartment. Now that you think of it, you're closer to Thrawn's apartment, maybe you could visit him some day.You hear the guys behind you, some guys of the church you sympathized with and are nice enough to help you for your house move. Vez appears with another box in his hands.“Where should I put that, Roween?”“Put it in the bedroom.” You indicateDay by day you get used to hearing this name, Nather, or rather Arzel use it too everyday. It took you some times but now you like to hear it. Vez didn't get his own yet and you think it's bothering him.You start opening the different boxes and tidy the room when he comes back with an embarrassed smile. You look at him, smiling lightly, wondering what it is about to say.""Roween? Huh… I was wondering… Are you free, let's say in the next few weeks ?"" His lekkus twirls and waves in his back. It looks like a dance.""I'm afraid I will be on duty for the next four months."" You shake your head. ""Why?""He obviously looks disappointed.""Oh… Okay. It's just, I have a little gallery exposing my works for some time and I’m asking friends if they want to come see it…”You raise your head from the box with eyes wide of excitement“Vez, you’re showcasing? It’s wonderful!” You embrace him with all your might. “Did you say it to our friends at church?”“No, not yet. I wanted to ask you first.”“If you’re still showcasing when I come back, I will come with great pleasure. Oh Vez, I’m so happy for you!”"

Din Djarin, Bo-Katan reluctantly concluded as she followed his foundling into the depths of the once beautiful city of Sundari, was a difficult man to hate.She wanted to hate him, and the first time she had seen him with the darksaber she was fairly sure she had. Even more so when he showed no interest in keeping the cursed artifact and had tried to give it to her. He had tried to be so stupidly, heartbreakingly kind, not even aware that he was just digging his fingers deeper into open wounds.Bo-Katan was fairly sure she had hated him when he turned up on Kalevala reunited with his foundling, shiny new ship, darksaber on his hip, and utterly oblivious to the fact that the crusade he now wanted to join had crumbled just like her leadership of Mandalore.Bo-Katan would also not deny that she had initially thought Din was an idiot to believe in children’s stories about Mandalore the way he did, to cling to his twisted and extreme version of the Creed when the evidence that his way was not the only way was right in front of him. Then, the more she spoke to him to more she recognised that, well, Din wasn't stupid. He was ignorant, perhaps. Maybe even through no fault of his own.No, Din Djarin was a deeply thoughtful man. She was beginning to learn that his tendency towards silence was less a lack of things to say and more a desire to consider his thoughts and words carefully. He was also an absolute sponge for information. Once he had been told something, it didn’t need to be repeated and when he wanted to, he sought information out relentlessly. Bo-Katan could admire him for that.She could, in a begrudging way, admire him for a lot of things.When she had told him of her plans to retake Mandalore, back on Trask, she had still been full of hope. That had been before the darksaber had slipped from her grasp, before Koska had left, before she had resigned herself to giving up and never setting foot on her home planet again.Din, on the other hand, had decided he needed to go to Mandalore and then just done it – no fancy plans, no backup. He had been told that he needed to have a dunk the Living Waters to be judged as redeemed by the cult that had raised him and so he’d gone, no questions asked. Never mind that the ask itself was ridiculous if they had truly believed the planet was cursed.Bo-Katan had wanted to hate him for that too, but she couldn't fault him because all he had done was force her to confront her own failings, that reclaiming Mandalore had never been impossible, to recognise that she'd just never had the courage to do it.Though when she found him, deep in the mines trapped in a cage, she was tempted to reconsider her opinion on his idiocy.He'd had the darksaber for crying out loud, that droid should have been sliced into tiny smouldering pieces long before she got there. She'd seen him fight before, this whole obsessed with redemption must have really thrown him off his game. Still, she dragged him out of there and reassured his kid that he wasn't dying and waited for him to wake up to see if he had anything to say for himself. He was technically Mand'alor, after all. “Where were you during the Purge?” she asked quite without meaning to as he and his son sipped their way through the pog soup.How had he never had pog soup before? She kept her eyes averted whenever he lifted the helmet. It seemed only right to show him the same respect he had attempted, however poorly, to show her back on the Imperial ship with Moff Gideon at his feet, even if she did think it was ridiculous.Unlike the last time she had thrown the question at him, it was not an accusation. Being amongst the ghosts of her people had mellowed the anger into curiosity.“On Concordia,” Din replied after a second. “And then whichever planet was safe.”“Why didn’t you stay?” She asked, voice quiet and oddly empty of hurt.Din sighed and put down the cup. “Alor wouldn’t let us.” Bo-Katan blinked, startled a little that he had actually answered. Seeing her expression, Din sighed again, a helpless little movement. “We had foundlings to protect,” he explained and everything clicked awkwardly into place.""You were defending your clan,"" she said, just as those on Mandalore had tried to defend theirs.Din nodded, solemn. ""The foundlings are the future. This is the Way."" Bo-Katan wasn't quite sure what it was that led her to offer to take Din down to the Living Waters. Nostalgia perhaps, or a desperate hope that not everything she had once known was gone. When she spotted the plaque, somehow still intact, she found herself reading it aloud, an introduction to Din, a bittersweet reminder for herself.Din, meanwhile, was staring at the Living Waters, still as a statue.Deeply thoughtful - Bo-Katan mused - ignorant but not intentionally. She wondered what he was thinking now.Then he reached up to undo his cloak.Bo-Katan watched in silence as he took off his weapons and jetpack and faced the water. There was a moment of hesitation, of doubt, and the child in her wanted to push him in. Then he stepped down and began to recite the vows and Bo-Katan was - moved, in spite of herself. She was suddenly and inexplicably grateful that he wasn’t ignorant in this.To Bo-Katan, there was nothing special about the waters beyond that they had once been the home of the great mythosaur, but clearly Din thought differently. As he descended, it was as though a great weight was lifting from him. His tone was reverent, his supposed redemption in reach. His faith in the waters shook something deep inside of her, made her want to experience what he was experiencing.When Bo-Katan had done this, all those years ago, it had been a spectacle. There had been no real awe, it was merely a matter of procedure, another box that needed to be ticked. Now though, there were no eager crowds.Just Din, his child, Bo-Katan, the rubble of a civilisation and the water.She wondered if she should say something, once he reached the end of the vows and had let the waters take him. There had been words, once, given by witnesses to those newly sworn to the Creed, but it felt strangely wrong to break the atmosphere that had built and she supressed a shiver.Then Din vanished into the depths and Bo-Katan didn’t even think before leaping in after him. By the time she pulled them back onto the steps and Din had caught his breath, the heaviness to the air was long gone.“I think that was a little more than just bathing,” she said, the words bursting out in a mix of hysteria and adrenaline. “You really need to learn to swim, Din.”Din made a choked noise beside her and she turned, fearful that he was struggling to breathe and that she’d have to undo all his hard work by taking off his helmet again and then, presumably, shove him straight back in the waters before he freaked out - ideally with the jetpack this time, but he wasn’t.He was laughing. A moment later, so was she.“I can swim,” he protested between chuckles. “Just not used to swimming in full beskar.”“Clearly,” she said, though the word was a little absent, She was calming, still processing what she had seen, or at least thought she had seen in the depths.“I’m Mandalorian,” he said once the laughter died down, wonder in his words.Bo-Katan had the urge to bristle again, to argue that he’d never not been Mandalorian, the teachings of his cult be damned but that wasn’t it, was it? He could have said ‘once again’ or ‘now that I am redeemed’ or something equally weird, but no. It had just been a simple statement of fact.When she looked at him, properly looked, she could see it. There was something different about him now, more settled. This was about more than his redemption. It went deeper than that.Perhaps she had been so focused on the traditions he kept, the ones that made her want to shake sense into him, that she hadn’t considered the ones he had been denied through circumstance and ignorance. Had he always doubted his place, she wondered, knowing that he hadn't properly undertaken this sacred ritual of their people?Shaking her head, Bo-Katan pushed aside the thoughts and the emotions had had risen up with them and stood, offering a hand down to him. “Alright then, son of Mandalore, get your ass off the floor.”Din chuckled again, but he grasped hold and let her lift him up. He turned to face her, considered her for a moment, helmet tilted in question. “Is something wrong?” he asked.“I think there’s a mythosaur down there.”She didn’t quite believe the words herself, but she couldn’t deny what she had seen with her own two eyes.“I thought they were extinct,” Din exclaimed, taking a hesitant step back towards the water, helmet focused on the water – searching now for something beyond the mystical power he had endowed the waters with.“So did I,” Bo-Katan admitted.When he moved and crouched at the edge of the steps, she leaned forward, instinctive, meaning to grab him and pull him back in case he went under again. But all he did was dip a gloved hand in and trace circles in the water as though the gentle movement could summon an ancient beast long thought forgotten.Maybe it could, for all she knew. Din had shaken her perception of a lot of things lately.“I heard stories of them as a child,” he said. “I thought I saw something, when I fell, but I didn’t get a clear look.”""I heard them too,” she said, “I saw one down there, I’m sure of it,” she repeated, no longer certain who she was trying to convince.“I believe you,” he replied, simple as that, and her breath caught in her throat, overwhelmed by his simple, earnest faith.Koska and Axe would have questioned, would have thought her mad, but Din?Din believed the stories, believed in the stories.A few minutes ago, she had mocked him for it but there was a mythosaur in the waters beneath the mines of Mandalore and Din, whether he had meant to or not, had technically been the first one to encounter it.Bo-Katan didn’t hate Din Djarin, she decided. She hated what had been done to him, the meaningless rules that had been forced upon him as a child and that he had been forced to cling to when everything fell apart but she couldn’t hate him.Din Djarin was a man of faith, and that faith had shown her that not all was lost after all."

Chapter Text


Chapter 1

Two old enemies from decades beyond stand across from one another.They spoken... briefly.Before the short battle begin.In mere seconds, it is over.His grasp of the Force is too shaky for him to sustain. He expects to go into the hells the Dark Side has planned for him.He. He didn't. Everything had happened too fast. Kenobi had...His whole body hurt. Muscles spasms oddly, his entire body frozen and incapable of movement...Darth Maul is dying. He had been struck down by Kenobi before. Only this time, the Force nor the Dark Side can save him. He is going to die on this dust ball of a planet at the hands of one of his hated enemy. The one who crippled him in their first fight. The one who is at the forefront of his mind in seeking out revenge. There is no one else aside from his old master that the Zabrak from Dathomir craved dead for all the agony that the Jedi caused him in his life.It did not ended how it should have. Maul should have embedded his lightsaber into his abdomen and find the Chosen One and train him... But now that is impossible.He failed yet again.And yet, the Jedi showed him mercy by holding him. No mocking. No boasting. No witty comebacks over defeating the Sith. Just calm acceptance. It should have infuriated the Zabrak, but his rage had faded with his body. There are still questions. What is the one who Kenobi is protecting?Maul can only think of one reason but needs to hear it from the Jedi's own mouth.""Tell me. Is it the chosen one?"" Maul asks while Kenobi holds him close to his chest.The old Jedi looks at him with something close to sadness and sympathy.""He is,"" Obi-Wan responds with conviction in his voice.""He…will…avenge us,"" Maul murmurs, finding himself a bit hopeful.The entire galaxy is turning blank, the face of his arch nemesis is fading more and more...Life has abandoned him just like the Sith has.Perhaps it is about time that he is placed out of his misery...""Maul...""Maul finds himself surrounded by stars. Up. Down. Left. Right. There it is all around him. He has caused nothing but death and destruction to everything around him. He lived a life full of vengeance and anger. Why is he in such a beautiful place?""I can answer your confusion,"" the voice states.It is the Jedi Master he killed on Naboo all those decades ago. Qui-Gon Jinn.""You. You brought me here,"" Maul states coldly, his eyes going wide as he regards Qui-Gon Jinn.""I am not your enemy, Maul. I never was. Neither was Obi-Wan. You have been used your entire life by Sidious."" Jinn states sympathetically.""Why? Why did you drag me to this place? Have you expected for me to repent?""""Your destiny could have been different, Maul. Sidious manipulated you. You cannot blame Obi-Wan for everything that went wrong.""Old rage burns up. ""Kenobi cut off my legs and killed me. I have every right to want revenge against that blasted Jedi!""""And you killed his Master and lover in his arms. He'd been where you were before. You both have a lot in common and suffered greatly because of Sidious."" Qui-Gon responds neutrally..Maul cannot respond to that. Once, it would have fueled him with anger but now he comes to a realization. Maul feels an epiphany slowly rising. Kenobi was a victim of the Sith just like Maul was. He lost his Apprentice.Like Kenobi, Maul lost everything...""I admit that you have a point,"" the Zabrak replies coldly, closing his eyes and swallowing down the bitter feelings. After a full minute, they pass successfully, and Maul couldn't help but feel free.""You are responsible for many crimes, causing death and destruction to innocents, contributed in pain and suffering for the galaxy and for the Jedi likewise. But you were also a victim.""He can feel something clenching up around him. It have been there before, briefly when Bridger turned his offer down, another time when Maul have failed to save Savage. Guilt...""...Why?""Instead of giving him an answer, Qui-Gon Jinn simply walks around him, ""Given the chance, Son of Dathomir, would you amend everything you've done?""Maul is surprised. ""What do you mean?""Qui-Gon stares, seemingly amused. ""If you were able to reverse everything, all the deaths that you have caused, putting an end to the Sith Master for years, preventing Anakin from falling the Dark Side. Would you go back?""What is Jinn's point? Maul had been an animal for so long. What does the Jedi want out of this? Why had he brought him here instead of allowing the Dark Side to claim him?Just how to respond to this? To stop Kenobi from losing his Master and go against his Master's plans? To guarantee that Skywalker does not become the Padawan of Sidious?""...Yes.""""What was that, my friend?""Maul replies. ""I would fix everything I could."" When Qui-Gon smiles, Maul scowls. ""Do not misunderstand me, Jinn, I would never renounce the Dark Side. I still serve that above everything else.""Golden eyes turn to expect gray ones.""But... I realise now that those innocents didn't deserve to die. The genocide of innocents weren't the right thing to do, I admit that much.""Jinn turns to him with a kind smile. ""So you would go back to fix your mistakes.""It is not a question. It is a statement, a fact.Maul scowls. What is he-? And suddently Maul feels pressure lifted from him, looking down to see his legs restored. ""What... What is this...?""""You still have much to do, Maul."" Qui-Gon says from afar. ""You can make better decisions. Redemption is possible for everyone. Just remember to call upon the Force in its entirety and not just the Dark.""Maul looks, swearing an oath to not disappoint the Jedi. He would stop this.The form of Qui-Gon nods...Memories of lifetimes away suddenly goes through him. He sees things-(-Maul descending downwards, no legs, defeated, shocked...)(-Savage dying in his arms-)(-Lady Tano refusing to listen to him on Mandalore-)(-Maul begging for Tano to release him and let him die-)(-Maul spending his years lost in the galaxy loathing this Empire and only using his fuel for Kenobi-)Now...Now he sees something he never saw before...(-Skywalker and Obi-Wan locked in lightsaber battle surrounded by lava, anger on Skywalker's face, pain and resignation on Kenobi's-)(-countless Jedi on the ground like discarded dolls, their empty faces more surprised than afraid-)(-the monster that is Darth Vader storming through, cutting through anyone who gets in his way-)(-a boy - the true Chosen One no doubt - staring at the sunset with hopeful vigor -)(-Kenobi falling at the hands of the machine that once been Anakin Skywalker)(-the Force striving from darkness returning to a balance that Maul never seen before-)The Zabrak is no longer fading. He is... sitting? On a speeder?In a distance, the Naboo Royal Starship is waiting. Maul finally comes to a harsh realization. He is back on Tatooine, going directly for Jinn and Skywalker!""Anakin, drop!"" Jinn shouts.Maul finds himself clamping down harshly onto the speeder's controls, breaking the vehicle away from Not-Vader before it could have crashed against the child, and jumping off.Jinn's expression morphs in distaste as he draws his green lightsaber.""Anakin, get to the ship.""Maul looks at the boy before regarding Jinn. He squashes down the desire of wanting to draw his lightsaber.""Qui-Gon Jinn, you have no idea of the danger awaiting you.""Jinn's expression morphs into further distaste before he charges forward. Maul activates his lightsaber, realizing suddenly that this is his old hilt, as Jinn comes crashing down upon him.The old Jedi is obviously unprepared for someone of Maul's caliber. The Zabrak continues to swing his lightsaber around him once he accustoms to the hilt, moving quickly as he tears at the Jedi's defensives.Unlike last time, Kenobi rushes in, blue lightsaber sparking to life. He attacks Maul, using the form that the Zabrak recognizes as Ataru. As the battle continues on Maul cannot help but wonder. Where is the grace of Soresu that has been evident in their last few battles throughout the Clone Wars?While they may have been able to stand against him a lifetime ago, now Maul is ahead of them in all fields. He can stand against the Master of the Order himself and perhaps emerge victorious...Maul pushes his hilt up against Jinn's face, and while he could have taken the advantage as he did many years ago, the Zabrak twirls around him and drives his fist into his gut, causing the Jedi Master to reach for that area with a gasp...Now it is just Kenobi and Maul...Ironic.Kenobi's brash and arrogance is palpable for the Zabrak to see as he continues to try to push him back. Another twist in irony is that Maul is now using Soresu, rapidly deflecting every blow as they lands, eventually driving Kenobi's hilt out of his hand.Instead of decapitating his head as he would have at one point, the Zabrak calls for both Jedi's lightsabers, placing them on his belt.Maul regards them both before staring at the Jedi Master.""Jinn, I am not your enemy,"" Maul assures, deactivating his lightsaber, much to the surprise of both Jedi. ""Let's negotiate. First, ease your companions minds.""Jinn frowns but is surprised when 'truth' rings through the Force. He does so, speaking into the com, and seconds later the ship descends.""The boy is the Chosen One,"" Maul speaks. ""He is destined to bring balance to the Force.""Kenobi pales. ""You knew?""Maul eyes him. ""Yes; originally I was to carry my Master's plan, but I had a vision. I would have gut Jinn, and you would have been the one who trained the Chosen One. My Master would have betrayed me and I cannot allow him to rule this galaxy so I offer an alliance with you Jedi to stop him.""Both Jedi are petrified by this, staring at one another, before the oldest respond.""How do we know that you wouldn't betray us?"" Jinn asks.Great point.Maul looks at the floor before staring up at the Jedi. ""I swear on my brother's behalf I would never betray you nor present a problem for the Jedi.""A oath that Maul promises to keep.The Zabrak floats their hilts back into their hands.""Undoubtedly a false promise,"" Kenobi spits arrogantly, activating his blue lightsaber and charging forward yet again.Maul ignites his lightsaber in irritation when Jinn blocks the strike.""Master, what are you doing?!""""He's not a threat. I can feel it through the Force."" Jinn states, staring at his Apprentice with a raised eyebrow. ""Now deactivate your lightsaber.""""He's a Sith-""""You must put your personal feelings aside, my young Padawan.""Maul stares at both of them with a slight smirk across his lips as Kenobi pouts and deactivates his lightsaber. Jinn does so next, and so does Maul.""Lead us aboard, Jinn, we have a lot to discuss,"" Maul says, planting his hands behind his back and walking behind the Jedi.His former Master would be in for quite a shock when they land on Coruscant.Maul would truthfully love seeing it and break each of his plans one by one. He would see that the true Chosen One is trained by the Jedi if only to teach him the power of the Dark Side later when the boy's ready to learn control.The Zabrak would make sure the boy go against everything that Sidious loves. Sidious loves the Sith, and so Maul would see the Sith in his image following the Rule of Two crash.He would make better decisions this time around, even though Maul would hold bitter feelings at having to control the Dark Side instead of unleashing it on all.He would settle for it. After all, stopping Sidious and killing that bastard would be satisfying.Maul thinks bitterly.
""You have won once, my Master, you will not win again.""





Notes:

Arthur's note: I have recently discovered how much I love the character of Darth Maul and was horrified that there's barely any fics of him time traveling to the Phantom Menace. I have tried and failed with many characters time traveling because they were boring and already used ideas or I didn't know that much about them. Darth Maul is someone who I can use in many ways.There are going to be several pairings in this fic. Maul x Sabé, Anakin x Padmé, and Obi-Wan x Siri is all that comes to mind currently. Of course there's going to be more but I want to use this fic to do something unique. I hope you all join me in this journey.May the Force be with you all always.

Chapter Text
All colour drains from Palpatine's face for a brief moment.He couldn't believe it.Out of all things that Sidious had foreseen, he could have never envisioned his obedient Assassin walking down the ship alongside the Jedi.The next that comes beside shock is absolute cold gripping rage and anger. And the vow to disembowel Maul into pieces, making him suffer for his betrayal!Has he not wasted all his time and devotion on this boy only for him to join the Jedi?Sidious has to contain his fury so he didn't lash out at the Naboo party in front of him. It was so tempting, but he knows that even if he unleashes his wrath, Plagueis would quite literally kill him and continue on the Grand Plan.While his Master is patient in the best of events - more so than Sidious -, he is going to be unhappy with this recent turn of events, that much for sure.Maul seems different now though, that much he will have to admit. Before, Maul was a savage animal. How did he grow to contain the Dark Side within him?He didn't know who is more captivating between him and the boy who practically spat the Force from within him, and that is a strange feeling. Sidious has grown use to planning for such events and revolting against them before they could have concerned his Master who could still punish him quite severely.But two clearly powerful individuals such as the little boy from Tatooine and his Assassin who hasn't demonstrated such knowledge and power ever can be a problem.Once the greetings with the Nubians and Jedi end, Valorum speaks.""I don't believe we met,"" Chancellor Valorum says with narrowed eyes, arching his eyebrow and making a quick observation over the traitor.Maul hums and Sidious walks forward, hoping to see what sparked this change. ""Neither do I. Come to think of it; I don't believe I met you ever in all my years as a Senator. Nevertheless, we thank you for accompanying my Queen.""At his voice, Maul turns to regard Sidious. They are reddish yellow as always, but one can easily see there is a sense of control of the dark rage that existed within them. A stability that took years to master. That took years to control.""The pleasure is all mine, Chancellor, Senator,"" Maul replies after a moment in a controlled tone.""We are glad to have your help,"" Valorum replies, still keeping his kind face, as he turns to the Queen and her entourage. ""Please follow the Senator. I have questions for my ambassadors.""Keeping the rage off of his features as best as he can, Palpatine does his best to keep his voice calm, sensing Maul's eyes are narrowed on his back, the second his hand fumbles over his lightsaber. That isn't the only noticeable sight. From afar, his Sith Master is watching with a disgusted glare.The second he left, Palpatine finds himself slightly more at ease, but he is still tense. He assures it is not noticeable as it can cause him to make a slip-up and further doom the Grand Plan. Yes, Maul is compromised, but that doesn't mean that the chances of the Sith rising are totally at stake.Hopefully, Plagueis knows that. That doesn't mean Sidious would escape his Master's attention, however...Eventually, the words come, and they fuel Sidious's deep fear. From the moment he saw Maul alongside the Jedi, he has been waiting for the moment when his Master summoned him.
'Apprentice, we need to have a conversation.'
The scathing tone does not publicly unnerve Palpatine, but inwardly there is fear that hasn't been there since he was that teenager who bowed before the Muun all those decades ago and accepted the name of Darth Sidious.The plan to kill Plagueis might never be a possibility as the Muun may not be merciful. While he has some leniency and even convinced Sidious not to kill a sniveling coward at one point, even Plagueis does have his tipping points.The Grand Plan failing is one of them!After having to stick with the entourage and dismissing the Queen and her Handmaidens - noticing one that seems amiss - Sidious walks to the building that has served as their place of plotting. He waits for Plagueis to come before him.In minutes, Plagueis charges in, his tall form hovering over the Naboo Sith. While it would not be a intelligent move, Sidious feels the instinct to draw his lightsaber and hope for a lucky swing, but he knows the likelihood of that happening is as likely as Master Yoda turning to the Dark Side!""You were warned what failure would bring!"" Plagueis barks, raising him into the air, causing his hands to wrap around his throat desperately, trying to relinquish his hold.Sidious gasps, not having felt so desperate and weary for so long. ""P-please, Master, allow me to explain my-myself!""The Muun releases his hold over his Sith Apprentice, causing him to drop onto the ground, and stalks over to his down form. ""Very well. Convince me to why I should leave you unpunished. Answer my questions to my satisfaction.""Sidious swallows down his fear and kneels on the ground in the middle of the Coruscant Compound's meditation chamber. ""Yes, Master.""""Your dog has failed in his mission,"" Plagueis says coldly, dangerously. Sidious isn't surprised when a holo image of the Queen landing on Coruscant appears, and it focuses on solely Maul who stands absently behind them. ""Now we may have a troublesome thorn to our side.""Sidious can already feel him drawing on the Dark Side. What is Plagueis going to do now?! He hasn't had such a punishment in over two decades! ""I have thought he was loyal to me!""Plagueis pauses. ""Go on...""Sidious carefully, so carefully, dances around his failure and slip ups, reveals. ""I believe that Maul saw something that made him join the Jedi.""He refuses to make it known that Plagueis was right about doing away with the Zabrak years ago. ""I thought he was loyal to us! I was confident of his skills. I ordered him to bid his time until the Probe Droids narrowed them down. Maul was loyal to me to a fault until this assignment for some reason.""Sidious does not want to present the idea of the Jedi knowing about the Grand Plan now, especially given it would piss off his Master a lot more...Plagueis glares at him silently, molten eyes narrowing. ""You are hiding something from me, Sidious. Considering this and the failure of that beast, I am questioning your worth. Perhaps the Master of Jinn would be a better option of gaining control of the Republic."" The implications behind it is clear, and Sidious realizes that the Muun can replace him now. ""After all, a beloved Senator being assassinated by the Jedi would paint things negatively for their Order, will it not?""Sidious tenses a bit, he can not, can not rebuke his Master when he knows that it may make things worse. That said, Sidious would not allow anyone to take his place when it comes to becoming Emperor, not even his Master! ""Things can still be fixed, Master.""Plagueis scowls briefly before folding his hands back into his robes with a chuckle. ""I should have partaken in Maul's training because you are clearly unworthy of raising someone in the ways of the Sith.""Sidious's anger skyrockets and his teeth grinds against one another.Plagueis slowly begins to circle him. ""You are fortunate I believe this situation is still salvageable. I have come up with another use of the Queen, though we might have to improvised until we can arrange for Maul's assassination.""Sidious promises darkly, even though he didn't vocalized it.That Zabrak would pay for his betrayal!Despite how Maul is supposed to be a weapon at his disposal, Sidious did feel some pity that he didn't have him at his side. The boy had showed such potential and would have made a powerful Sith Lord!Fortunately, Plagueis seems to understand that pity as he sighs, and the Dark Side relinquishes. ""Do not fail me again, my friend; I want Valorum removed while I'm gone. See it done. Failure is not an option.""Sidious locks down his emotions tightly at those implications. ""I understand, my Master.""""Pray you do my old friend,"" Plagueis snaps thinly, ""I believe our goals are no longer aligned with one another. We both want control over the galaxy yet I wonder if you only claimed Maul as your Assassin to assist us...""Sidious scowls in distaste as he senses his Master's thoughts become debatable. ""Maul is nothing more but an animal. We should kill him and move onto the rest.""""No, I shall discover what provoked Maul's change while you deal with Valorum,"" Plagueis declares, walking away from his still kneeling Apprentice, disappearing in the darkness of the room.Maul spotted his former Master the moment he came off the ship. Remembering what happened in his timeline and that this man was responsible for the suffering of his brother and himself, suffice to say, it took a lot of patience for him not to run his lightsaber through the Senator's chest. Perhaps he would one day have his chance, but for now, he shall focus on the present and that is assuring that the Jedi doesn't perceive him as a threat.That would be difficult but thankfully Jinn and the Queen seems to be defending him for now.So Maul is left reflecting on the recent events in the Queen of Naboo's chambers, his hands toying with his hilt, modifying it to his greater satisfaction. His old hilt symbolized a loyal attack dog long gone, someone who didn't have a proper lit over the Dark Side, undignified and ungraceful in all manners.The lightsaber in his final days produced two crimson-red blades, and the upper grip-guard resembled that of the Inquisitors' lightsabers, albeit broken and bent outward. The lightsaber had been built out of pieces retrieved from an Inquisitor's blade. He would hide the hilt by attaching a piece of wood to it and it worked.So Maul decides to use the same model design sans the wood. The lightsaber that Sidious have gifted him with no longer fix in his hands but he can improvise as he settles for a similar lightsaber staff. Regardless, he will not alter his lightsaber colour. He is going to always be a Sith.The Zabrak disregards the robes in favour of the Nubian attire that the Queen had been ""polite"" enough to leave behind. The Zabrak truthfully did appreciate the gesture and swap out the robes. Although they didn't suit his usual dark attire, Maul have to admit that they are a relief than anything Sidious rewarded him with.Moments afterwards, the door opens, and the Queen of Naboo walks in, alone. Maul would do well to ignore her. He has to think deeply about the time traveling experience he had. He needs to stride the tides to his direction so he can finally at last kill the bastard without being painted as a tyrant once more.She continues to do her own thing, reaching for a mug Maul didn't notice was there, and pour the contents inside in a cup.Maul watches her turn around to his direction and immediately pivots his head away from her.The woman actually almost whistles when she spots him. ""Wow, you look nice.""Maul would do well to avoid her...""Come now; you don't have to be quiet here. I want to know what you are really like."" She continues.""The Jedi doesn't think of me too lightly, your Majesty,"" Maul bites back bluntly, wanting her to go away.""That doesn't mean we don't,"" she replies defiantly.""Don't you have a duty to fulfill, Queen of Naboo?"" Maul asks, now irritated as he fixates her with a long, unwavering glare.""Yes,"" the Queen responds, her lip twitching.""Then leave me be,"" Maul demands. He is not here to grow closer with the Queen Of Naboo when he has plans in store to stop his Master.The Queen stares at him with a challenging smirk. ""What am I supposed to do for the next few hours then?""""Uhh, your duty whatever that may be to save your planet,"" Maul responds sharply, glaring at the woman.""Oh come on, I am trying to think positively right now, Darth,"" she responds in a teasing tone, sitting down across from him. ""Come on, let's talk. Let's try to get to know one another."" She inspects him briefly. ""I have to admit I never did see your kind before.""Maul glares at her. ""Your Guards prefer to keep their hands on their blasters every time I come around.""""Yeah sorry about that."" Why is she apologizing? Sidious nor anyone who Maul met never did...He chuckles. ""It is typical after all. My intimidating appearance is a benefactor for their distrust of me.""""It isn't personal,"" the Queen replies, suddenly growing sad. ""I hope you don't think my people would judge you for..."" She stops, inspecting him, ""your unique appearance.""""Your Guards judgement of me is not unfounded,"" Maul replies hastily, staring at the woman who sustains direct eye contact with him, their two orbs locked onto one another ruthlessly.She replies defiantly. ""I believe that it is...""""What do you mean?"" Maul snaps his head to her direction. Is she seriously implying that she actually feels sympathy for him?""I admit that my people's views on different species is not entirely valid,"" the Queen states, eyeing him up and down.Maul begins to respond. ""Your Majesty-""""Your Majesty,"" a lady's voice interrupts their conversation, and Maul watches three Handmaidens walk in, ""the Senate will soon be assembled.""The Queen nods. ""Thank you, I will be there shortly.""""Queen, when you go before them, you will be disappointed."" Maul warns. The Queen nods and Maul spots faintly a Handmaiden behind the other two stiffens, and Maul arches a eyebrow. Why does something not feel right?""The Queen and her Handmaidens leave, allowing Maul to meditate in silence.When he senses the frustrated presence of Qui-Gon Jinn approaches perhaps an hour later, Maul opens his eyes and looks up, watching as he enters, a glare in his eyes.""Why are you irritated, Jedi?"" Maul queries curiously.""The Council has decided that the boy's fate is clouded,"" Qui-Gon responds coldly.Maul is beginning to understand why Anakin Skywalker may have became Darth Vader later down the road. The Jedi Council's hypocrisy is increasingly showing even in this time period and their arrogance shall be their downfall. Perhaps the Jedi was destined to fall if only to change...The Force obviously disapproves of the current status of the Jedi, that much that the Dark Side is laughing at them...""Then why do you follow along with their arrogant Order?"" The Zabrak asks, shaking his head in disapproval. ""That Order would collapse in on itself soon before my Order will rise.""""You speak of your Master or yourself?"" Qui-Gon asks bitterly, glaring at the Zabrak with glassy eyes.""No, I don't have any plan to destroy the Jedi Order,"" Maul replies genuinely. ""The Sith needs to collapse or they will cause so much darkness and pain.""Qui-Gon arches his right eyebrow. ""You don't want to kill the Jedi?""""Don't look at me like that, Master Jinn, I will simply acknowledge that they are many flaws within the Jedi; but without the Jedi, the Sith in the shadows will claim this galaxy. I have seen it. One must have a larger view than the narrow-minded view of the Jedi or the Sith."" Maul replies, recalling the era of the Empire and not willing to live like that in the shadows yet again, even if he has to swallow his bitter feelings against the Jedi Order.""I can sense that you have a great understanding of the Force surprisingly, given how young you seem to be and how much the Dark Side surrounds you."" Qui-Gon replies, placing his hand on his beard in deep thought.Maul chuckles half-heartedly.""You will be surprised how much the Dark Side clouds everything, Master Jinn.""Palpatine storms through the corridors of the Republic's Senate Building. He would have to handle the Trade Federation's 'situation"" sooner. The Queen Of Naboo, while a strong leader compared to her predecessor, is ineffective currently. If Maul does indeed spill the beans so to speak and reveal the truth of Palpatine's true Sith Alignment to the Jedi, Palpatine would have to have the backing of the entire galaxy on his side to paint them as the villains.The Senator's Guards follow behind him, but Palpatine does not slow his pace. Many of the Senators walking by knows not to interfere, and the Sidious within him can only smirk slightly when it comes to their respect and fear. Valorum would have no idea what hit him.They enter into the Senate Chamber and immediately are assaulted by the pandemonium of different species. Alongside him, his Guards halts, and Palpatine enters the Naboo's pod and has to wait for a few minutes until those appointed take their places. Only then the Chair of the Senate does his duty, while the Vice Chair Amedda stands like a statue behind him.""Silence!"" Amedda exclaims to calm the chattering Senators. ""I will have silence! The Senate is now in session!""Despite the chair's best attempts, no one in the pods can actually hear the Chancellor's first words. It is only due to Valorum's voice rising that the voices begin to quiet down.""There have been troubling accusations. The chair recognizes the Queen of Naboo.""The Queen Of Naboo speaks so passively. ""Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the senate, a tragedy has occurred which started right here with the taxation of trade routes and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation! Please listen to us as we are all in great danger!""That causes thousands of worlds to speak their protest, and Palpatine stares grimly - outwardly - at the Queen of Naboo who seems to be losing her devotion to argument more and more.""I wish to speak on my people's behalf,"" Palpatine speaks strongly, coming to back his Queen.""The Senator of Naboo will be allowed to speak,"" Vice-Chair Amedda declares.""My friends, I implore you to listen to our Queen!"" Sheev speaks horrifyingly. It would have to be a speech that causes the entire galaxy to fear or respect the name of Sheev Palpatine. ""My home, Naboo, was blockaded mere days ago by a Trade Federation armada! Those savage beasts would never be brought to justice if we choose to ignore the Queen's warnings!""The Trade Federation Senator declines to take the bait and simply stares at the Naboo pods, unmoved. The Queen meets the Neimoidian's eyes and scowls, causing him to stare away before addressing those within.""This is a bold statement! We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth!""Before Valorum could have spoke in protest, Palpatine fixates the Neimoidian with a glare that causes him to stiffen slightly. ""There have already been ambassadors appointed. They have made their statements clear before the Jedi Council and the Chancellor himself. The Trade Federation wanted to assassinate the Queen of my world.""""The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed."" The Senator of Malastare states, ignoring Palpatine's response.""The only thing I ask of you all is to do your duty and free my home!"" The Queen begs to the Senate pathetically.More commotion continues, and the Queen is losing more and more support.""We apologize, your Majesty."" The Neimoidian begin, sounding more solemn. ""Rest assured that whatever is occurring on Naboo has no official sanction or support by the Trade Federation if what you say is true. We need to form a commission to determine who is responsible and how best to solve the situation. I can assure you that we are not dishonest. We've already sent a negotiating party to investigate, but unfortunately we are yet to receive a response. We cannot act rashly and without proof, your Majesty."" Sidious can sense the lies spitting off of the Neimoidian in waves.Now taking the chance to take control yet again, Palpatine speaks a lot more darker, folding his hands within his robes. ""We should form a commission to determine what happened on Naboo. You are unfit to do so, given the accusations hurled at your fellows currently.""""I recommend that we wait, Chancellor,"" the Neimoidian states, looking at Valorum.Amedda leans forward and murmurs furiously inside of Valorum's ear. Valorum's face falls in a pained wince but he nods.""Perhaps this is a misunderstanding, Senator, Queen,"" Valorum states solemnly. ""We should have a recess to reassemble tomorrow.""That causes the entire Senate Building to boom, arguments being spit left and right.The Queen states in surprised disbelief at what is going on, her emotions in turmoil. Betrayal, anger and fear for her people practically radiates from her that a normal person can sense it.""Chancellor Valorum!"" The Queen snaps in a hard voice, her teeth pressing against one another as she throws her feet down in a pitiful tantrum, making Palpatine have to resist from laughing. Ah, that teenager defiance never gets old... ""My world is being invaded as we speak! My people are going to be dead by the time you do something! You can't just do this! You are going to allow more people to die! Nute Gunray is evil! He is-!""Valorum interrupts her. ""Under the circumstances, I don't have the power to dispatch anything but an investigation team, your Majesty. Not when the accused party is attempting to investigate on Naboo. Until the time comes, you will be given an order to wait here on Coruscant.""Shouts of both protest and agreement meets the Chancellor's announcement. It is just as expected. In this day and age, the position of Supreme Chancellor of the Republic is ineffective and with the Trade Federation following the law, Valorum's hands are chained quite literally, and the Queen's face deflates. The Queen of Naboo have been defeated...But there is still Senator Sheev Palpatine. He will be the figure of hope for Naboo and the Republic. He will be the figure to fear for the Trade Federation and their lackeys. He will be the future Sith Emperor that no one will question.The Queen is obviously seconds away from completely backing down as much as her teenager's naivety screams that she wants to protest and tell the Chancellor where he can shove his orders at.Before she can, Senator Sheev Palpatine takes a step forward and Sidious has to resist smiling.""In that case, you leave us no other option."" Palpatine declares in a voice that cut through time and space. He let all the agony, betrayal and disillusionment he should feel surface and be heard, while in the pit of the Dark Side Sidious laughs. ""The Queen has come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. We were not elected to watch our people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee! If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed."" Palpatine sighs, and the entire Senate is silent completely, none of them ready for what is to come next. ""I move for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum's leadership!""No retort comes for seconds afterwards before maelstrom again consumes the Senate Chambers.




Notes:

Arthur's note: An idea struck me. I love Padmé but I wanted to have Palpatine steal that moment where he calls for the Vote of No Confidence into Valorum. Just making a little tweak in that scene and building Sidious up as the villain we all love while making him still the Apprentice of Darth Plagueis as proven with that other scene.I wish to point out that Padmé at this point is still a child and I feel like she is... bland in the Phantom Menace. Ahsoka in the Clone Wars was built up well, becoming a mature Jedi in all but name by the end of the war. Padmé is a little too mature in The Phantom Menace in my opinion and Sidious is by far my favourite villain in ALL of Star Wars so I decided to have him steal the spotlight this time.May the Force be with you all always.

Chapter Text
""You didn't take long.""The three Jedi approaches behind him, led by the tiny green menace. Despite how Maul never fought him before, he knows that Yoda can defeat him in all realities. This is the Grandmaster of the Jedi Order after all with centuries of training, and Maul is no longer arrogant enough to believe that he can overwhelm Yoda.""Darth Maul, I presume?"" Yoda asks, standing alongside Mace Windu and Plo Koon. Outside, Jedi are standing in guard, their preparation obvious...""Let's not mince words shall we?"" Maul asks, regarding the Grandmaster and Master of the Order who approaches him, ready for battle but not showing signs that they hold ill will toward him despite their curiosity.""A shocking sight, it is, to see how full of scars you are despite how young you are..."" Yoda says attentively.""You do not know the things I went through, Jedi,"" Maul declares bluntly.""The Dark Side of the Force is strong in you. Very strong,"" Windu replies, placing a hand on his chin as he observes the Zabrak.""Have you came here to arrest me, Grandmaster?"" Maul asks, wishing to cut to the chase as he stares at Yoda. Beforehand he have stepped near the window so he can cut the glass and escape if he has to.""Wish to help you, we do,"" Yoda replies while Maul narrows his eyes.""And how would you help me?"" Maul inquires bitterly.""Master Yoda believes he can extract the darkness from you,"" Plo Koon replies, staring down at the tiny Grandmaster. ""And quite frankly so do I after Qui-Gon talked about you.""Maul chuckles. ""Surprising...""""Pose no harm we do to you,"" Yoda replies wisely.""Unless you wish to change that,"" Windu adds, not unkindly.The Zabrak scoffs. ""Then why are there over dozens of Jedi outside, waiting for the moment to detain me?""""Safety measures,"" Koon replies. ""They would not harm you.""""I cannot be redeemed,"" he states flatly though something within him sounds sadden. ""I am beyond even that. The Dark Side is enrooted within me. The Jedi cannot turn me.""""You have a control darkness, that much we can all sense."" Windu admits with a sigh.""Perhaps help us you can. Know that you were trained by someone, someone that caused you so much pain, we do. Who is he?"" Yoda asks, staring at him with deeper eyes that seems to penetrate pass the soul.Maul cackles like a madman as he responds. ""He have been fooling you all, is the cause of this whole invasion, and will continue to plot from plain sight. He has already won. His Empire is already on the rise. You have no idea of the deeds he would cause, of the massacre that is to come; but at the same time you can't attack him or else you would collapse regardless.""Their silence shows how disturbed they are.This is good. Perhaps he can convince these Jedi somehow. Playing Sidious's own game is how Maul would be able to defeat him.""Endure the Jedi Order can,"" Yoda replies, though the tone in his voice suggests he isn't too certain.""You don't understand, Grandmaster, they can't. The Jedi Order is already set in disarray."" Maul replies, and his eyes flashes as if he is remembering something from so long ago.""Are there more like you?"" Windu interrogates thoughtfully.""There are none like me. But I am not the Sith you need to concern yourself about. If I was, I would have already been at your doorstep, slaughtering through the feeble Jedi back at the Temple."" Maul replies sharply.Yoda sighs, asking. ""Could you provide us with his name?""""Sidious. Darth Sidious,"" Maul replies, shocking each Jedi at his compliance this time.""What about his name he uses in public?"" Windu asks, wanting to take the fight to the secret Sith Lord already and deal with him before he can present a problem.Maul turns around. He can sense the Force whispering to him, 'Not yet.' Why? He doesn't understand. Has he been shoved in the past to save the Jedi like future Jinn said?""You are not ready to know such information,"" Maul proclaims.""Know his identity you do. Your enemy he is. Yet not assist us, why?"" Yoda presses curiously.""The Force wishes me to reveal nothing further at this time,"" Maul says matter-of-factly.""A Sith follows the will of the Force?"" Master Windu asks, something close to mirth in his voice.""In some ways this is a trial for you, Jedi. If you survive, you will at last do what we Sith have been able to do for over a century.""""And what, pray tell, is that?"" Koon asks, genuinely curious.Maul chuckles.""Adapt.""Windu narrows his eyes, though Maul realizes how he seems to be probing him. ""Maul, we don't wish to cause any problems with you. But we cannot allow a Sith to walk among the Republic.""Maul shrugs. ""That is your choice to make. Do you wish for me as an ally or enemy?""Windu turns away from him to face the sunset. ""Based on Jinn's report, you showed restraint and reason on your journey here. Your choices only reflect conscientiousness that very few Sith have ever did before."" The Korun freezes for a few seconds as if debating with himself, his hand on his chin in deep thought. ""Master Yoda must be right-""""Hmmm. Explain.""""You are not truly a Sith,"" the Jedi Master replies without hesitation. ""At least you don't value their codes with all conduct. The Dark Side surrounds you but I can sense that it doesn't consume you. You are quite a strange specimen.""Maul smirks. ""Bold assumption, Master Jedi. There is a ship on Tatooine that I have arrived in. After I'm done with the Naboo's crisis, you will bring it to me and I will in trade give you some of the information that you need.""""And if we refuse?"" Koon asks.""Then you will never gain the information that you wish for me to share. The choice is yours to make, Jedi.""Everything goes quiet afterwards...Blackmailing is something that Maul would have to settle for right now.Obi-Wan is not happy with how his Master seems to be so devoted to refusing to listen to the Council's advice, but he stands back in silent support, refraining from crossing his arms across his chest.The tension in the Council Chambers is obvious though the source of frustration is directed at the certain problems that they have currently.Darth Maul is quite a unnerving individual.""The Force is strong with him,"" Ki-Adi-Mundi declares, drawing Obi-Wan's attention to him.""He is to be trained then?"" His Master asks.There is silence for a moment.""The Council is... unsure,"" Depa declares.""Unsure?"" Qui-Gon questions, surprised.""We have misgivings about the boy being trained, we believe he is too old,"" Master Windu proclaims.""He is the Chosen One, you must see it,"" his Master argues, resting his hands on his belt in frustration.Saesee Tiin declares. ""He's ought to be rejected and sent back to his home...""Obi-Wan frowns intently, not exactly agreeing with that choice. He can see Master Windu is not agreeing with that either... but he is of course loyal to whatever the Council decides like all the Jedi does. Still, Obi-Wan thinks. Can they see that the remaining Sith will just seize Anakin now that they know about his existence? He'd be an unstoppable force of the Dark Side, and truth be told, he doesn't think that the entire Order can stop him if he reaches that peak of power.Qui-Gon grunts in disapproval. ""If that is your decision, I'll train him myself without this Order's consent if I must.""Anakin is surprised, before shooting him a grateful smile.""That's why we are split,"" Mace retorts uncertainly, ""IF he is the Chosen One, and IF he is to be trained, it should be as a Jedi dedicated to upholding the code.""Qui-Gon replies frustratingly. ""I choose to take him on as a Padawan learner after Obi-Wan completes his trials, he will be trained in the Force.""""Oh?"" Yoda asks, unimpressed. ""Forget Qui-Gon, you do, it is our own Council that we will keep on who is ready to take the trials. Already have a Padawan, you do. Impossible it is to take a second.""Qui-Gon states. ""We cannot turn him away! You all heard what the Sith told me earlier!""Saesee Tiin grunts. ""You do not listen to us, Qui-Gon.""""Oh, I listen to this Council when I have to, but I am not going to turn someone who has so much potential away!"" Qui-Gon fires back in a rare moment of losing that typical calm composure.""Qui-Gon, please, calm,"" Plo Koon says, successfully calming things down before they got out of hand.Mace leans forward. ""We can resolve this later. The Queen wants to return to Naboo. We have to stop this invasion.""""And draw out the Dark Jedi's Master,"" Master Gallia speaks for the first time. So they think Maul and his Master is a Dark Jedi? Curious...""May the Force be with you,"" Yoda says, effectively ending the meeting.Obi-Wan can sense the frustration that Qui-Gon holds against the Council currently and can't help but feel a slight surge of satisfaction that the Council agrees with him.That does not change the rising fury brimming from within the surface from both Master and Padawan...Maul is definitely not acknowledging the fact that Sidious let alone Sly Moore both seems to be infuriated with him right now. She was abducted from Umbara by Maul years ago and imprisoned for months in an ancient tomb in the Cron Drift so there is already bad blood established between the two.Maul ponders... why does Sidious and Sly Moore seems to have a deep care for one another? Perhaps there is a bit of humanity left in him after all, and perhaps the prospect of having to deal with two of the most kriffed up individuals terrifies him.Disregarding the thought, the Zabrak watches from a distance as Kenobi's outrage is palpable as he addresses his Master. Skywalker sits there next to the R2's unit.He pauses as he draw closer and Kenobi speaks furiously. ""The boy's dangerous, they all sense it, why can't you?""Maul stares at him in disbelief before observing Skywalker. The boy is staring down at the R2 unit quietly, holding it tightly, attempting to keep himself in check. What in the Sith's hells is that fool thinking? The boy is RIGHT THERE!Qui-Gon seems unmoved as he reprimands Kenobi. ""His fate is uncertain, he's not dangerous. The Council will decide Anakin's future, that should be enough for you. Now get onboard.""Okay, okay, Maul has to admit watching Kenobi being reprimanded is hilarious...Obi-Wan slowly turns and leaves.Anakin fiddles with the R2 unit for a moment longer before bowing his head and stating, ""I don't want to be a problem...""Maul didn't know what compelled him to reach over and place a hand on Skywalker's shoulder. ""You're not, Skywalker.""""Agreed,"" Qui-Gon states, kneeling down in front of the boy.The boy stares at him with a solemn expression that says 'Then what is all this commotion about'?""I just... I don't understand...,"" Skywalker replies, ""Why can't I be a Jedi?""Qui-Gon sighs. ""You will be, Anakin, whether the Council agrees to allow your training or not you will be a Jedi, I promise you.""That appears to relieve Skywalker a bit, but, a different concern enters his mind, glancing back and forth between Qui-Gon and Maul. ""Both of you can't teach me?""""You don't want Maul to teach you,"" Qui-Gon interjects, concerned. ""You would be a shadow of what you are.""Maul snaps his head to Jinn. ""I would not brainwash the boy. If anything I would teach him how to embrace humanity.""""He needs a Master that can understand him,"" Qui-Gon replies sharply.""A Master..."" Anakin's eyes go wide.Qui-Gon softens. ""Not like that Anakin, this isn't slavery like on Tatooine. Jedi refer to Master and Apprentice as a teacher and a learner. Just a mandate of respect.""Maul starts a bit and glances at Skywalker's big blue eyes. How can this be the same person as Darth Vader?""Oh,"" Anakin murmurs, ""I had been wondering about that.""""Regardless, there is much I could teach you about being a Jedi,"" Qui-Gon replies.""Master Qui-Gon sir, why don't you like Maul?"" Skywalker asks, regarding the Zabrak who is watching intently. ""He's not that terrifying...Maul stares at them silently for a moment, working a thought in his head. He wonders... if Skywalker is a former slave from Tatooine... what did he really know about being a Jedi? What will be required of him? Did he honestly understand what would be asked of him?""Skywalker, none of the Jedi view me positively because I am a contradiction. Unlike them, I would train you to be a human being with your own independence and the capabilities to defend yourself,"" Maul declares vigorously. ""The Jedi would not approve of me training you because you would go precisely against their ways...""Qui-Gon frowns at him and stand up, crossing his arms across his chest, but saying nothing likely for Anakin's sake. He definitely knows where Maul is heading with this one and doesn't approve of it at all.""What do you mean?"" Skywalker asks, ""I don't understand. Jedi are human! Well, I mean, and other races too!""""Skywalker..."" Maul interjects with a sigh, ""You really have no concept of what it means to be a Jedi. Tell me, what do you think the life of a Jedi requires?""""Jedi are heroes,"" Skywalker replies, ""they go out, do good, help people and save their lives, they're famous. A Jedi is someone I wanna be so I can do good, and when I'm strong and famous enough, I can go home, free all the slaves, and make mom proud of me.""Qui-Gon closes his eyes, a soft sad sigh escaping his lips.Maul can see hope in those big blue eyes for all of the slaves and his mother and some part of him hates to crush his dreams. ""That's a good hope, Skywalker, but, the second half goes against what it mean's to be a Jedi that adheres to the Code.""""Huh...?"" Skywalker asks, looking utterly lost.""As a Jedi, you must follow the rules of the Order, their Code, obey the laws of each world you go to,"" Maul explains. ""Take Tatooine for example, slavery, as awful as it is, is legalized there. Ignoring that the Republic doesn't even reach Tatooine, you wouldn't be allowed to just go there and begin freeing slaves. Even if you were, how would you even do that? A Jedi doesn't have the money that isn't allocated for such a assignment, you could never afford to purchase and free them all. Using the Force or your lightsaber to forcefully free them wouldn't be allowed either, in fact, it would be strictly against the Code.""""But... that's...,"" Skywalker stammers.""Beyond even that Skywalker, as a Jedi, attachments are forbidden. You would be forced to give up your attachment to your mother, you'd never be allowed to go back and free her,"" Maul continues, recalling the very thing that led to the Jedi's destruction. ""Beyond that, you're not even allowed to love.""Skywalker visibly recoils. ""What?!"" He turns to Jinn, hurt in his eyes. ""That's... that's not true, is it?""Jinn is silent for a few moments before he opens his eyes and softly admits, ""It is.""Maul flinches as the Force, as the song, rings around Skywalker. A ripple, a distortion blows out of him as his emotions explodes in distress as he feels his hopes for his dreams and desires dimming. He stares at him sadly. Skywalker looks so utterly betrayed, he opens his mouth to speak a few times before closing it. Maul find his stomach twisting at the sight of him, of the lost little boy.He remembers when he was nearly that... well Skywalker isn't precisely dark but he remembers all the times he felt such emotions. He remembers slamming his lightsaber into the back of Siolo Ur Manka, the very first Jedi whom he killed, a fresh murder in this younger body. Looking back, Maul feels the harsh grip that is guilt creeping up against him for that incident and Skywalker...Finally, Skyw...Vader states with absolute anger, ""I never should have left Mom after you freed me.""""A Jedi's life is sacrifice, Anakin,"" Jinn replies as if that excuses everything, ""And while I personally don't follow the code to the latter, and view it as more of a guideline, the basic principles are the same no matter.""Skywalker whimpers and looks down, dejected.Jinn grunts and turns to frown at Maul, as if saying. ""Look what you have done...""Maul meet his gaze, a defensive glint in his eyes. ""Don't put this on me. He deserves to understand what he was walking into. He's already had an attachment to his mother, a deep one, one that helped him through his early life as a slave. Learning that he couldn't help her after the fact, asking him to give her up, he never would have been able to fully do that, Jinn. If she somehow died while he had the strength to save her, it would have destroyed him. It would have lead him straight to the Dark Side.""""Anakin is the Chosen-""He shakes his head at Jinn's lack of seeing it. ""Look at him now, Jinn, stretch out your senses and feel. He loves and cares too readily and too freely to be a proper Jedi. It would just clash with who he is on the inside and leave him unstable if not outright insane. He would fall. You would not be able to prevent it.""Jinn grunts once more, turning his attention to study Anakin intently. ""I suppose you're right. He would clash with the Jedi so badly and so readily I can imagine him being quite alienated in his classes and studies. What do you recommend?""Maul frowns. ""The Force is strong with him, and we can only agree that his power wouldn't be left unchecked. I can sense you are different from the typical Jedi, Jinn, but he needs a parent, not a Master. There are other Jedi that would suit that need preferably. There is perhaps one that will handle Skywalker better.""""I cannot treat him like my son,"" Qui-Gon says among a quick realization. ""Only as a student...""Maul nods, acknowledging the Jedi's point. ""You need to see if he truly desires to become the Jedi that he wants to become. His training should not be forced or required simply because of some 'destiny'. Is that the only reason you even freed him? Would you have freed him if he wasn't this Chosen One?""Skywalker's stare makes Maul strangely want to punch the older man in the face. Seeing the Jedi Master on the ground, cradling his injury, will be both amusing and depressing at once. He'd thought that Jinn's beliefs were a threat against his Master, but like every other Jedi, he has flaws and highlight heavy traits of arrogance and hypocrisy.He has a epiphany. Leaving Skywalker under Jinn might turn out to be worse than leaving him under Kenobi. He can still become Darth Vader. He wants the best for Skywalker, even if he has to get his hands dirty. But Skywalker would have to have the maturity to understand things when the time comes.Maul has to assure that the Jedi wouldn't damage Skywalker too far or he would have to handle it himself.Maul watches as the Maverick Jedi fight a scowl. ""No, it's not the only reason, but it is a factor. We'll talk later, Anakin.""He didn't give another chance for questions as the Queen of Naboo arrives and makes for her ship. Hastily, the Jedi joins her, speaking silently as they move to the ship.""Coward,"" Maul murmurs softly, shaking his head in disappointment. Trust it to be him who reassures Skywalker.""I thought he wasn't another one of them,"" Skywalker says in a soft tone, ""I thought he cared, but Jedi aren't allowed to care."" He glances at Maul. ""Why is it like that? Just because of some code?""Maul recalls a lesson from a Sith Holocron belonging to Darth Revan in his travels, and finds himself paraphrasing it, ""Skywalker... the Jedi Code doesn't grant all the answers. You can't blindly abide by it, you can't stay true to a single ideal, especially one that attempts to make you more of a machine than a human. It's a failing the Jedi have had for a long time. Though Jinn is different than most Jedi, he's following his culture and his beliefs.""Maul didn't know why he wants to reassure him. ""But don't mistake what he says. He does care in his own way, but being a Jedi limits the way he can show that care. He's not a bad person, none of the Jedi are. He's just a good Jedi who have flaws of his own.""Skywalker tries to think on what he says, but he sags and rubs his eyes, exhausted. ""This... I... this is all so confusing.""Maul places his right hand on the boy's cheek almost instinctively. ""I know it is. Come, let's get onboard and get you to bed. We'll talk in the morning.""""Weeesaaa goin home!"" a large shout from the Gungan come that makes the individuals jump, including some of the Handmaidens who still are standing there and instantly whispers among themselves about Binks.""That guy is... interesting,"" Skywalker states with a small laugh.Maul frowns. ""He definitely is.""They start walking towards the ship, but Maul stops when Skywalker's hand slips onto his invitingly. While he didn't agree with the Jedi on many things, he does agree that attachment can be dangerous, something that Maul had to learned the hard way and Skywalker of this timeline will have to eventually as well.The galaxy doesn't resolve around anyone...He had no problem with love and care and friendship so long as they did not become full-blown toxic attachment. Being attached to his mother made Skywalker feel a brief longing for Qui-Gon. Maul has to make sure it didn't ruin his life and make him obsessed to seek someone like Sidious out for guidance again. And right now, he needs something, someone to lean on after the mess the Council made of this situation, leaving him lost in this confused galaxy.He will not resist the urge to steal Sidious's prized pupil from him yet in a different manner instead of killing him this time around. Let the boy view him as a mentor and it can benefit the entire galaxy.So, instead of breaking away, he gently presses tighter on the boy's hand, gives him a small smile, and walks onto the ship with him...
'By the Force I have gotten soft.'
""We are not going to apprehend him! Have you lost your mind?!"" Saesee Tiin's frustration is palpable as he addresses the one who have just spoken.""I'm telling you that I have felt shatterpoints from him from a mile away. In some way, he is fearful of this Master he speaks of,"" Master Windu replies, pressing his hands against one another.""I worry about the influence that he would leave on Skywalker if we continue to leave him unchecked."" Rancisis says calmly.""It can lead to them going against years of Jedi beliefs,"" Plo Koon continues, seeming unease but not as apprehensive. ""Darth Maul has emotions that I also felt when we confronted him...""""Which perhaps can be positive for the sake of the Order,"" Depa offers wisely, her serene voice easing the minds of most of them. ""I have to admit this; Maul, without those feelings, would be lost to the Dark Side. This is... something that we have never seen before. It can actually be beneficial in the future.""Mace frowns in consideration, knowing that Depa's wisdom sometimes exceed his own. When the time comes, Depa will be able to continue his legacy and so will the Padawans that come after her.""Are you suggesting that we go against our teachings? Are you suggesting that we allow a Dark Side user to continue to roam about in our mist? Are you suggesting that we allow someone who goes against our Code to corrupt others to do so likewise?"" Tiin asks bitterly, his voice getting louder every sentence. ""Are you losing your way, Master Billaba?""Depa is about to rebuke when Mace beats her to it. He scowls at the Jedi Master. ""Please address my former pupil respectfully, Master Tiin, as I will not tolerate disrespect of her from anyone, including you. I would see you removed from this Council if such behaviour persists.""Tiin's eyes go wide before instantly he murmurs an apology, even though there is a slight glare to Mace's direction at publicly calling him out in front of the Council.""Agree with Master Billaba, I do,"" Yaddle offers compassionately, breaking the awkward silence. ""Warn us of the coming darkness, Dooku did, for the past many decades. Maul must be the Force telling us that change is among the horizon.""""The Dark Side is a poison to the Force. He can influence Skywalker to easily follow in Revan's footsteps."" Rancisis declares grimly, siding with Tiin, but not appearing to agree wholeheartedly.Silence fills the air for a moment while Yoda and Yaddle exchanges a look, seeming to be communicating through their stares alone.""A poison that Maul seems to understand,"" Yoda adds, much to the surprise of everyone on the Council. ""Sit back, the best course of action is currently. Sense no dark intent against the Order from Maul, I did. Still change, that can, but anger and fear to this Master, I can sense. Judge him properly, we cannot.""""If he does prove to be a threat, he would be contained,"" Mace adds, supporting the Jedi Master. ""Maul may go against decades of teachings but that doesn't mean we should assume him to have traitorous intent. As ashamed am I to admit it, there have been light leaning Sith in the times of the Old Republic.""""Maul should have been contained the moment he landed on this planet!"" Tiin exclaims in utter frustration. ""Skywalker should be too! Both are dangerous! If there is any Chosen One, he would have been raised from birth by the Jedi, not a emotional boy who comes from a desert planet!""Plo Koon turns to his direction. ""Master Tiin, I know that you are loyal to the Order to the latter. But think He had a chance to kill both Qui-Gon and Padawan Kenobi yet refrained from doing so. That is to also be noted.""Tiin asks, flabbergasted. ""You are willing to defend him? He's clearly corrupting one or both of them.""""Qui-Gon has been my friend for years and doesn't seem to be threatened by Maul,"" Koon fires back, seeming to be irritated entirely with the Jedi. ""I would trust his judgement. Qui-Gon has been tested with the Dark Side on numerous occasions and he'd remained loyal and strong despite it all. I won't allow your hubris to convince this Council that he will become a threat, even if Maul is a true Sith.""""Then perhaps Jinn is not the only one who can be lost to us."" Tiin says harshly.""Peace, Master Koon, Master Tiin,"" Master Windu says, breaking up the would-be argument. ""Only time will tell if Darth Maul presents a problem but we have to think wisely before we can act.""And no one can avoid the sudden strain that has just been formed within the Council Chambers.




Notes:

Arthur's note: Siolo Ur Manka is Maul's first EU kill. I have decided to include that version of his first Jedi kill instead of Eldra Kaitis because I feel like it shows how much of a powerful Assassin he was in his younger days. Teaming up with a Jedi would have disgusted him at that point so I think Maul would have killed her and find a way to dispatch of the bounty hunters himself without any teamwork. Manka was also a powerful Jedi Master and it shows Maul's attributes instead of having him target low Padawans and Knights among the Order...Sly Moore was Palpatine's 'lover' and he did genuinely care about her. He arranged for her to be sold into slavery as a child, then he ""rescued"" her and killed her captors. In gratitude, she became his aide and lover. Most members of her species are pretty strong in the Dark Side and she is no exception. Umbarans as a culture are a bunch of duplicitous, cynical manipulators who historically are aligned with the Sith, so she and Sidious got on fine. I wanted to include her in this to show all of Palpatine's allies as in Disney Canon he only had Amedda, Tarkin, and... that's it? In the EU, there was people who helped him grow in power who have never been utilized (thankfully) in Disney Canon (them bastards ruin my favourite characters!)May the Force be with you all always.

Chapter Text
Anakin can't sleep.This has happened before back home.He has gone on for days on end without sleeping.But this time... it's different.Anakin can feel something is literally keeping him awake, preventing him from doing so...Eventually, the sensation gets too big, and Anakin walks through the ship's corridors, feeling led somewhere. In the living room, he sees his dark friend laying in his makeshift bed, moving around frantically.""No!"" The man shouts, and Anakin wonders what is going on. Why does Maul sound so afraid?Not knowing what to do, Anakin places a hand on his shoulder, not sure how he is going to react. The groaning man frantically shoots up, his hand reaching for his arm. Anakin feels his entire world transferring colours...Seconds later, the surroundings around them change.A deep throated cackle rose into the air as a figure in black turns to two opponents with red lightsabers ignited. Anakin wants to help but he's trapped for some strange reason, and his resistance grows more when Maul is slammed back by a strange lighting.Smoke coming from his body, the Zabrak stares with fear and concern as the monster continues to fight Maul's ally. It is only a matter of time before he's overwhelmed. In seconds, the two lightsabers impale themselves into the stomach of Savage. His horns shrink and the massive bands of muscle burns away from his body. The last hazy remains of green magic diminishes, then dispersed and vanished, leaving his ally in the shell of his now-oversized armour.Deactivating the crimson sabers with a click, the monster takes a step back as Maul's ally is suddenly yanked back, crashing onto the ground several meters away, causing Maul to begin to run after him.""Savage!""""Brother, I am an unworthy apprentice,"" the one known as Savage murmurs softly, his dying breaths coming raspy and shallow. ""I am not like you. I never was.""Yellow eyes going dull, he trembles as he fakes a last breath and then lay still, eyes still open and fixed on Maul. Anakin feels turmoil on Maul's behalf, horror crossing his face as he stares at Maul before closing his eyes. He remembers all of the people who he knew throughout slavery... have seen some who have been angry all the time like Maul... have seen some who have went missing mysteriously... Ashla... she had never even knew her last name...""Remember, the first and the only reality of the Sith, there could only be two."" The figure says in a mocking taunt. ""And you are no longer my Apprentice. You have been replaced.""These words draw out Maul's pain, and he can see his face scrunching into deeper agony. He can tell that Maul never feels like more of a failure than he did in that moment, a scornful expression claiming his face.The hooded figure leaps down to Maul who draws a second lightsaber, one that looks... different and darker than the red ones. The moment he charges forward, Anakin actually feels hope, hoping Maul pulls it out this time and avenge his friend...The monster parries the blow, expecting to knock Maul off balance, however, he is evidently surprised by Maul's regained flexibility as the man ducks and spins, sweeping a leg out in an attempt to trip the hooded figure over only for the elder man to hop over the attack as he strike again at Maul who deflects the strike by crossing the two sabers together. The monster pushes with further force until Maul's arms buckles and give way, and he takes the advantage to roll over Maul's back and kick him down onto the ground his sabers falling from his hands. The monster raises him into the air, slamming him onto the ground, before to the wall, and to the ground yet again.What once have been determination and courage is now replaced by pain.""Have mercy! Please! Please!"" Maul's voice grimaces with pain. He gasps for breath and glances up at the elder man with begging eyes as he chokes on his short breaths and the bitter scent of his tore flesh.""There is no mercy."" The monster responds coldly, his pleasure obvious. Anakin is unable to watch ad he hears Maul yelp and shout, blue tentacles - what is it? - crashing against his down body. He wants to help his friend, do something for him... anything to stop this!But what can he do?!""No!"" Anakin screams, dropping to his knees as he tries to reach the shrieking Maul. He doesn't – he can't – seeing the lightning cut through Maul makes his throat to tighten.Their surroundings change and everything returns to normal. They are on the Naboo's starship yet again.Anakin can feel the back of his head pounding as he fights to stay conscious. He didn't realize that the man slammed him against the wall but he cannot fault him. Nightmares… they have always been there for him, and there have been cases where Anakin would scream out his mother's name, and when she came, he would push her away.Maul's eyes open and he sits up as if returning to reality, looking around him, before his bloodshot eyes travel to Skywalker, and he realizes what he has just done. Of course, Skywalker was the true Chosen One, even as a child, and he must have felt his pain.Skywalker doesn't ask, slipping over to Maul's side, not sure what provoked him to do such a thing but he didn't care if he has a negative reaction as he leans in. While initially trying to push him away, Maul eventually consents. He shifts slightly, bringing his arms up and holding the boy next to him, not realizing it's been so long since he touched another affectionately. Anakin's emotions are out of control, which is to be expected, and he's trembling. Fear is consuming him, trapping him in an internal spiral strong enough for Maul to sense it. It doesn't help that Maul is terrified too, because the nightmare evokes so many of his deepest traumas.""I… How could he hurt you like that?"" Anakin whispers into Maul's side, and he doesn't have a answer for that himself. Maul did many terrible things that even Anakin Skywalker would never understand. No matter what, the child will not lose his innocence in trying to help Maul.""It is irrelevant,"" Maul replies hotly.He wants to rebuke, to say anything, but Anakin knows deep down that Maul is right.""Maul, what was that?"" Skywalker asks softly, terrified.""It was simply a shared nightmare,"" Maul explains, not wanting Skywalker to press into the matter. ""It makes sense that it would be extremely detailed as a result."" He doesn't really believe that, but he refuses to let himself dwell on it any further. He won't stand by and watch as Skywalker breaks due to what happened to him.Why does Maul care so much about this blasted child to sustain his innocence?!""I won't let anything happen to you,"" Skywalker says fervently, running his fingers through Maul's tattoos, something that would have been insulting at any other time.""He abandoned me."" Maul's voice is almost shaking; he's definitely close to tears. It's a testament to how screwed up he is.""Then he doesn't deserve you,"" Anakin argues adamantly, though again, he doesn't know the history between the two.""You should leave, Skywalker, before I harm you again,"" Maul says, guilt immediately creeping up as he holds the child to his chest, finding himself not wanting to release him.""You didn't,"" Skywalker replies sympathetically, having felt worse in the past. ""I startled you and you reacted like everyone would in your position."" Skywalker's hand clenches around Maul's. ""You don't have to be afraid. Mom always told me having someone at your side makes it hurt less.""Maul's hands tighten up, willing himself not to allow tears to escape his eyes. Skywalker notices that similarity, the teeth gritting together, the refusal to waste water...It is something that his mother even had struggles in not doing so, despite having been a slave for longer than even Anakin.It's been several hours since they left Coruscant. All of the passengers on board is sleeping, save for one who continued waking up throughout the night, mind dwelled with worry.Sabé is afraid. Padmé and Eirtaé are asleep, not too surprisingly next to each other. Rabé is just eating, too worried as she is thinking about their planet. She will be asleep soon, leaving Sabé by herself to dwell on the people that they left behind.Sabé is close to Yané and Saché. Besides Padmé, they are her best friends. She hopes they are still alive and well by the time they return to Naboo. If something happens to them, Sabé doesn't know if she would be able to forgive herself.Biting down her fear, Sabé walks through the ship to the fresher so she can take a shower. A proper Naboo lady is meant to have respect for their body after all. And for goodness sake, she is still wearing the itchy makeup!She stops when she sees Maul in the kitchen, sipping down coffee, head bowed. The man definitely had a rough night. That, or he doesn't sleep in general... Both are possibilities...Please don't look up...Not that she holds anything against Darth Maul, but she didn't want to talk with anyone right now.Of course, everything has to go against her favour.He snaps his head up, staring at the Handmaiden with two crimson orbs. ""Your emotions give you away, lady, you must learn to hide them if you wish to sneak pass others."" Something about his voice makes Sabé feel a twinge on the inside, a involuntarily shiver escaping her lungs. ""What's troubling you?""""I… I'm just afraid for my aides back on Naboo,"" Sabé admits, not even offering to try to convince the man otherwise when he is some sort of a Jedi who can probably read her emotions like a open book. ""I don't know if you know what fear means, but there must be some sort of humanity.""Maul smirks. ""I am definitely not a human nor do I inhibit their qualities.""Sabé frowns in consideration. ""Are you a slave or something?""""You are never a slave of the Dark Side,"" Maul says tersely. ""The Dark Side is at my command. I serve no one. I am free.""Sabé replies quickly, feeling bad. ""I'm sorry… but what are you? Some some type of Jedi?""""I am not a Jedi,"" the man replies sharply, and Sabé gulps, fear crossing her expression. ""The Jedi are slaves to their beliefs. The Sith otherwise embrace their attachments. I would never be among their Order. They are blinded insects, decaying by every second. If the Sith doesn't destroy them, they will destroy themselves through hypocrisy and blind faith.""Sabé doesn't know what he is talking about so she decides to ask another question. ""...So let's get this straight What is your species? Are you some sort of strange human?""""I am a Zabrak,"" he replies, and Sabé notices that this time he is more… softer as a contrast to last time.""Tell me then, why did you join us?"" Sabé asks, this time in a more demanding voice like the real Queen Amidala expected of her.""I saw a way to my freedom. My former Master only saw me as a means to an end. Ultimately, I rather kill that old bastard at the end of all things."" Maul replies, taking another sip before changing the subject. ""Naboo's culture amazes me. I noticed in the past that women seems to be the dominant ones on the planet like on mine…""Pushing aside the question of what planet Maul lives on, Sabé has a more pressing matter to address.""How do you know about Naboo Culture?"" Sabé asks. Everyone knows that Naboo is dominant by women and have been like that for the past thousands of years. Other species do not... fit well among Naboo for good reasons.""My former Master…"" Maul replies coldly, causing Sabé to feel remorse rising on his behalf. ""He educated me on the subject.""""Who is he?""The Zabrak's golden eyes stares deep into her yet again, outline of fear clouded in them. ""Revealing such to you would place you in danger, your Majesty. He would come for anyone who knows his identity. He's coming for me. I can still feel him trying to claim me his dutiful servant yet again.""""You're afraid,"" Sabé notes, taking the risk and walking forward to him, positioning herself next to him. ""You don't have to be. You shouldn't have to be. Would you like to talk about it? We can be… friends.""""I never had a friend before or at least not one trying to use them for their own advantage,"" the Zabrak proclaims dryly, sounding invested in the word alone. She should be intimidated by his presence.""Well, maybe now's the time for you to have one,"" Sabé replies brightly.""I'd murdered for my former Master. He gave me commands and I obeyed without hesitation. Would you be friends with a murderer?"" The Zabrak's tone is indifferent and cold now but there is... also a sharpness, as if he wants her to go away for her own good.""Forgive me if I'm wrong but it sounds like you have been… brainwashed, manipulated. You shouldn't have to address anyone as Master, not even former. You are your own man with a whole galaxy before you. This exterior doesn't define you. You can still make your own choices. You are not property to be disregarded.""A abnormal feeling clenches around his chest.He reaches for it but is surprised to find no wound. Something about him is beginning to feel a firm overprotectiveness over the Queen. It is almost similar to Savage and the few others who he genuinely cared about in his life...Maul is not a Jedi. He would always be an enforcer of the Dark Side and a Sith no matter his time travel experience. He won't betray the Jedi, not if they have to deal with another Empire. The Jedi keeps the galaxy secured and they are needed as much as they need change. The Sith as they are operating currently will only be decaying tyrants...What is it about this native of Naboo that makes him feel suddenly connected to her? It is not like his connection to Sidious which compelled him to please his Master at one point.It is not even like his connection to Savage but seems to be different - deeper in some ways, shiner in other ways...And it makes him feel weak and powerful at once.""Who are you, your Majesty?"" Maul asks, his throat constricting.""Padmé,"" Sabé replies, feeling guilty for lying to him like this but having to keep up the act. ""My name's Padmé.""Yané dodges under the barrage of blaster bolts, watching another Naboo Soldier fall as a result. She rolls out of cover and fire her blaster pistol, scrapping whatever Battle Droid that comes in range. Of course she regrettably couldn't catch them all but she's happy that she got some of them.Saché comes at her side, firing her blaster at the round of Droids. Yané feels a blaster bolt landing bitingly at her shoulder, causing her to drop, and for Saché to unleash endless volleys of bolts into the Droid responsible, before dropping next to her in concern.""Yané, are you okay?!"" Saché shouts, ignoring the blaster bolts still sailing in the air.""I will be!"" Peeking out of her corner, Yané fires a blaster, shooting a Droid's head off. The Soldiers still at their side angles their pistols to the Droids direction, huddling up behind Yané and Saché. They are still survivors! They cannot let these Droids win!Yané watches as a friend falls, and she grimaces in pain but continues to fire in complete fury. Saché luckily is still standing and fighting as best as she can while avoiding blaster bolts so she doesn't get herself killed. Finally, they manage to break through the Army, and it all seems over.""We did it?"" A Nubian Soldier asks with a tad bit apprehension, her hands on her blaster as the relief is obvious.A hooded figure walks through the entourage, a red blade at his side. Yané's eyes go wide as she takes several steps back, feeling shivers shooting through her body. The hooded figure swipes in front of him at his right and claiming his first victim, before chopping down to his left and claiming a arm of another Soldier. Each of his blows land, cutting through each of the unsuspecting victims who didn't ever know what hit them.""Blast him!"" Yané commands, firing her blaster at the figure, causing the reflected blaster fire to crash against someone else.Casually deflecting the bolts away from himself to some of the Soldiers, he stabs his lightsaber through Saché's stomach, and Yané cannot tell for the life of her if the wound is mortal or not! Her sharp gasp does cause Yané to shiver, but she didn't have long to reflect as she is seized into the air, suddenly unable to breathe. The last she saw is a glare from the golden eyes before…Blackness-Yané feels nothing but pain shooting through her body. She sits in the darkness, trying to find a pathway out. Her hands are her only companion as she eventually finds the strength to stand up.Yané stares, wondering if she has finally been killed in the battle. Is this how Naboo heavens feel? If so this is rather disappointing...She clamps her eyes shut regretfully. Padmé, Rabé, Sabé, and Eirtaé would never recover from her death...Adding to the death of Saché!Light in front of her manifests, and Droids walk up to her - not a pleasant sight! - and grab her arms. She tries to fight them but her hands being tied to her back prevents her from doing so.Oh kark, she is still alive!She is brought before... a shocking sight. A individual clouded in red robes. For a moment, she didn't recognize him, but it didn't take long before old memories come back rapidly. He is none other than the former King Of Naboo, accused of nameless amount of corruption when he was ruler of the planet, and thought to have died a while back...""Ars Veruna!""His face grows solemn but Yané can't tell if the solemn expression is sincere. ""My dear, where are your other bases? Things doesn't have to end this way. They will be given a chance to surrender. No one has to die.""""You joined the Trade Federation?! How can you do this to your own people?!"" Yané exclaims.""The Republic is failing. I was... offered a better alternative for our home planet. Once I gain control over Naboo I can help us better ourselves.""Yané spits. ""If you honestly believe I would be telling you anything, you rat, you're sadly mistaken. My Queen is on Coruscant and she probably already addressed the Senate. Soon, there would be a Jedi occupation.""Veruna's face becomes sharper, as if insulted by the accusation. ""I have someone who wants information out of you,"" he replies, a tad bit forcibly. ""I assure you he would be less than lenient with you. Just give me what I want. I don't want to have to witness someone who is a fellow Nubian to suffer.""""You and I are not the same! I would never betray my own people!"" Yané snaps, causing him to look down in lament for a brief second.""Then I'm sorry.""A hooded figure walks to her, two Droids accompanying him. Yané cannot even see the individual that the hood is shielding. Beside them are Saché with a bandaged wound around the stomach.""You have one last chance to tell us what we want to know,"" the hooded figure demands. ""I will tear the information from both of your minds piece by piece. You can save your friends from further suffering. The choice is yours to make.""The figure speaks in a way that Yané almost believes it but she knows what manipulation is from a mile away. She will not give in, no matter what. So what if Padmé loses one or two of her Handmaidens? So what if Yané has been told time and time again that she is the heart of the Handmaidens? The medic? The pilot? The one who keeps the other Handmaidens in check?She will not submit!""I won't talk talk!"" Yané rebukes defiantly.He sighs, as if resigned, before tilting his head to Saché.""Very well. I see that you would not give up so easily."" The hooded figure turns around and aims his hand to Saché, her hand going to her throat as she gags for air.Yané feels her heart pounding.""Stop!""He does not.""Stop!""At last, after a entire minute, he does. Saché falls into a coughing fury… hopefully. Regardless, Yané feels the hot white fury coursing through her soul at seeing Saché tortured like that.""I can sense that your will is stronger than your friend,"" the figure says mockingly, and when Yané remains quiet, there is a tighter tone of address. ""No matter, I was hoping that would be enough to convince you that resistance is futile.""""Yané, don't tell him anything he wants to know!"" Saché shouts.Glaring at his ghostly image, Yané replies. ""I will not be telling you anything!""""It is not up to you. Your mind will speak,""— the figure's golden eyes fixes the woman with an icy glare—""or it will break.""He eases closer, hand outstretched mere inches from the woman's face. Yané attempts to pull away, but a magnetizing force grasps her attention. She wheezes against the binders cutting into her wrists. It is pointless. A sharp pain courses through her nerves as the Droids wrenches her arms back and out of control.""Give me everything,"" the hooded figure commands, causing Yané's face to twitch with turmoil.""No! No! Stop it!"" Yané yells, and she would have grabbed her head if she was allowed to as she struggles even more to fight off the ones restraining her. Struggles to fight against this monster who is trying to learn information about the ones whom she trusts and will protect with her life.Yané reminds herself what is at stake, and who she is protecting. She remembers her friends, handmaiden sisters, her precious Queen. She remembers how much had been sacrificed, how many people had already died in defense of Naboo. She didn't know what information the figure wanted to tear out, and she didn't care. Whatever it is, she will fight until the bitter end.Yané does everything in herself to defend her honour, knowing that her friends would suffer in the long run if she gives in and allow the monster to tear the information out of her mind. The fight pour out of her chest.""I will not talk!""At that proclamation, Yané's vision blurs into a haze of undefined shadows. The room fades around her, the hallways going blank in her mind. All she can see, the only reality she can hold onto, is the menacing and plaguing face peering at her behind a gloved hand. And a voice—inaudible, but hissing from the recesses of her mind.Talk.Yané is vaguely aware that every muscle in her body is quaking. Her chest convulses, her lungs burning as she wheezes for oxygen that will not come. Her head trembles; she can almost feel the figure's fingertips close in over her skull in an invisible grip.""Tell me."" His words reverberates, cold and distant but still ever so powerful. ""Who is the Queen of Naboo?""Yané allows a choked cry as the figure's strangling grasp grows tighter. She can barely move, her body begging to escape, like a trapped animal.It does not have to end this way. Speak, that's all you have to do.Yané senses her rebellion begin to crumble. She attempts to shift her focus to something, anything, that will distract her from the voice injecting fear into her subconscious. Fear seeps in, and she tries to keep up. She refuses to cave in.Very well. Then you will break.A head-splitting pain pries into her mind. It is unlike any physical discomfort she has ever faced before, because there is no chance of escape. Because this is agony. A surge of memories and emotions surfaces before her. Every moment of rage, of grief, of curiosity that she has ever experienced boils over, as she re-lives each memory at an tormenting pace. Her brain appears to invert—the thoughts still her own, but now outside of her ability to control. They pass with blinding speed, her mind incapable of processing it all.For a moment, she watches as blasters tear against Nubians—the ghoulish forms of enemy tanks vaporizing her friends. The cries of the wounded. The gunfire of blasters. The betrayal.She sees only carnage—days of violence and death, of lost people and crushed hopes; and she can do nothing to stop it. All she is, all she knows, slowly handed over into this monster's possession. She is transparent, forced to confront her own unbarred thoughts; which allows this monster to sift through as he pleases.Yané opens her mouth to finally respond, but stops herself short. Her words break off into an excruciating yell.She feels pushed to the edge of life. She imagines her body levitated over an endless chasm, feet searching for solid surface, hands trying to find surface. But, when she focuses, she can only hear the tantalizing voice of her captor, persuading her to give in.""Tell me now.""Impatience flares in the figure's golden eyes. For a moment Yané feels her feet giving way slightly as the monster drags her forward. He catches hold of the woman's jaw, jerking her head up so their eyes lock. He smirks at the fact that he almost has what he wants. Yané, In turn, manages a weak but equally defiant glare, wanting him to see the look in her eyes.Yané set her focus on her sisters, anchoring in their memories for strength. She remembers Padmé, Sabé, Rabé, and Eirtaé. They would never give in!Then she thinks of Saché—her best friend and most beloved sister, the one who had been at her side since the beginning. The one she had allowed torture prior to her own torture session. The reminder ruptures Yané's concentration, and she feels herself drowning.She twitches at the might of the figure's hand at her direction.""No! No! Noooooooooooooooooo!"" Yané yells to Naboo's hell itself, aware that nothing would free her from this monster's grip.The figure must have sensed the weakness. He latches onto the woman's anxiety, draw from it, uses it to his advantage. Yané feels brimming tears well in her eyes, recognizing her raw concern for Saché is now a weapon in the monster's arsenal.""Your friends,"" the devil hisses.Yané tries in vain to refuse. But the devil is merciless, and even now she can feel the intrusive force drilling its way into her mind.She feels her conscience tear at the seams, the last shred of willpower stolen from her grasp.""They.. are.."" she chokes out.Stop! Yané wants to scream at herself. Don't tell him anything.It is too late.The monster draw the words from her. Before she even realizes what she is doing, she is spilling all that she knows – from the moment of the beginning of the Trade Federation, the Queen's real identity, the location of primary bases which would serve a use at the end of all things. Everything.His eyes narrows at the mention of Padmé, but Yané hardly notices. She falls limp in his iron clutch. Regret burns as hotly as her head, as she surrenders to her overwrought emotions. She has betrayed those who she held dear...
I'm sorry, Padmé.
For a moment she forget about this monster, the goal, the ambition to protect everything. She blocks out the sharp voice inflicting doubts at the back of her mind. As the room start to fade to black, and consciousness diminishes, all she wants is to feel her sisters wrapping their arms around her.
I failed you all… I discredit my people… discredit Naboo…
Yané feels his grip suddenly relent, and she collapses in a heap. She trembles, struggling to collect her shattered composure. Ars Veruna stares down at the teenager, eyes wide in silent horror at all he had just witnessed. Yané looks up at the hooded figure. Something has changed in his expression. His brow narrows in thought, and there is a hint of surprise and confusion in his face as he regards Yané.Despite the prodding blasters at her back, Saché risks it all and dash to her side, placing Yané's limp body to rest on her hip. Yané's head is pounding badly and her hands is rubbing tenderly through her head.The expression hardens, regaining his elusive demeanor. He crosses his arms over his chest as he turns away and summons Veruna and Gunray - where did he come from? - to his side. Yané watches as they exchange words. Their exchange is muffled and like fading waters, as if she is spectating from under water. All that matters right now is Saché.""Take them away,"" the monster says with a motion of his hand. ""Go through the underground tunnels. Find the Naberries and capture them under any means necessary.""Yané jolts. She may have just doomed Padmé's family.No, no!He is going after Padmé's family, and Yané is helpless to stop them while Saché is too weak! If Padmé's family dies because of her weakness, Yané will never forgive herself!The Droids drag them off to a cell, and Yané knows that her friends might suffer even more because she wasn't strong enough.Yané whimpers. ""I failed.""




Notes:

Arthur's note: Shout out to Courtesy Trefflin for allowing me to use a similar nightmare sequence that they used in their story called Gates of Hell. It's a must read fanfic like all the things they right. I also 'stole' the slave, Ashla, from their amazing story, Dark Legacy. Ps, don't tell them, but I consider them my Disney Canon counterpart in many ways. ;)I realized a while ago that if someone time travels there would be ripple effects from not only the present and future but the past likewise. Say someone died before they can end up living due to this. When you travel back in time, you are not going back linearly, but a parallel universe. I'm not using that as a whole or else things would be extremely different. The ripple effect has affected not only the present and future but the past, thus explaining Veruna's presence instead of why he's not dead like in the original timeline when Plagueis killed him.Btw, I head canon that Naboo have reverse psychology. In the days of the Old Republic just like in the 1800s with women, men had to marry a woman or they would be shamed on Naboo. Getting a woman pregnant calls the man to be ousted and refer to the man term of a whore. Now, in the time of the Phantom Menace, men are viewed less as so. That's not to say Nubian females are cruel but suspect to see that women would have a amount of control concerning the planet's culture in this fic. In the movies, novels, books, and comics I have also noticed more women than men on Naboo so I believe firmly that this is true.May the Force be with you all always.

Chapter Text
The last few days on the ship in Hyperspace has passed in a blur of preparations. Maul have been persistent in sparring with the Jedi and the Jedi agreed, only to show that they are way out of his league. In Maul's opinion, Jinn is getting too old to be using the Ataru form, Soresu would help him much better for surviving and not weakening himself through mobility. He was only been a 'little' indignant when he had said that to him, but Maul is amused to see both he and his Padawan has begin training in it, and while they cannot win against someone like Maul as of yet, they are effective together. Even this Padawan version of Kenobi is - unsurprisingly - starting to adapt to Soresu extraordinarily well.Jinn begin to train Skywalker as well using his green lightsaber, sparring with Kenobi. Of course, the boy has yet to stagger Kenobi in training but he is learning surprisingly quickly how to touch the Force and can do several things.Eventually, they arrive onto Naboo, and Maul hopes that the Trade Federation hasn't convinced the Gungans to join them. Anything can happen with this changed timeline, though the shadows of whom Maul have merged with has been urging him to return to his place to Sidious's side.Quite frankly, Maul understands why Ventress returned to Dooku at the end of the Clone Wars. Traumatized people would return to their abusers all of the time, and even after all these decades - Maul is finding it tempting to let bygones be bygones and return to Sidious to carry out his bidding. That is apart of the shadows that Maul blended with...Although the Queen had intended to meet up with the leader with that goofy Gungan, something within the Force screams that Maul should be more cautious, and he listens to that part, knowing that Binks might be idiotic enough to get them all killed...The Zabrak is not doing the right thing this time around only to have his life tragically cut short.To keep up the pose of not dampening her makeup, Padmé is persistent to not jump into the water, and Binks offered his services, but Maul instantly shut down the idea, offering a bit of his abilities known as shielding underwater. One of the Handmaidens come forward, offering her assistance, and while Maul is initially not sold on the idea, Padmé allows it.Maul wraps a shield around them which prevents them from getting wet, jumps into the water with his companions, and move to the Gungan city. He feels the Force Presences of the Gungans, but continues his move underneath, until they make their way inside of the inner city. So the Droids haven't removed them from their inner cities yet like in the original timeline?Hm, curious.The Gungans in fact seems at peace, and perhaps the reason of this change is because Sidious is still adjusting his plans to remove Maul from the equation without kriffing himself in the process. The likelihood of this Trade Federation Invasion succeeding has lessen to immense proportions.Maul walks up to the Gungan leader along with Padmé and her Handmaiden, Sabé. ""Boss Nass?"" The Queen states, earning a nod from the larger Gungan, and scowls from the others who start to gesture for nearby guards to remove the three. ""I am Queen Amidala of Naboo. I come before you in peace. We need your assistance. People are dying.""""Wessa don't want to get involved with yousa war."" The Gungan leader says in a tone that broods no argument.""I can show you that the people alongside you is suffering,"" Maul replies, knowing that he would have to settle for the Gungans to join him in these troubling times.A soft laugh vibrates from the leader, who hold out a hand, halting the Soldiers from advancing, ""And how do yousa thinkin about doin theesa?""""Your Honour,"" the Handmaiden begs, walking ahead of the Queen.""Whosa dis?"" He asks.""I am Queen Amidala,"" she reveals in a grave tone, stunning even the Zabrak. Maul curses himself as a fool. ""This here is Sabé, my loyal bodyguard. I come before you because Naboo needs your help.""""Wessa been approached by the Viceroy. Wessa not threaten by him."" Ah, that explain things. Sidious is indeed a devious old bastard to use the strain relationship between Nubians and Gungans for his own advantage...Just a way for his former Master to up him once more. Well, Maul is not going to let that happen.""Nute Gunray is a man who makes promises but only serves his own purposes,"" Maul states coldly, hiding the irritation at being deceived. His younger self would have probably not even noticed the differences.""Naboo needs your help, please!"" The real Queen begs.""Naboo? Yousa think yousa so smartiea, yousa think yousa brains so big! Yousa speak like weesa below yousa, like weesa not good like yousa. Why should we…""Maul outstretches his arm, causing the Gungan Guards to move forward instinctively, only for red glows to begin filling the air, manifestations making themselves known. ""Look for yourself,"" he declares, ""and see the fate of those suffering."" The manifestations abruptly changes, highlighting images of families being torn apart, of Droids terrorizing innocents civilians, of children being starved and beaten.The Gungan council can see the change in their leader, know that these manifestations will change his mind and endanger their own people, and move to intervene, ""Boss yousa shouldn't…""But he has heard enough of their refusals and whines, enough of their protests. ""QUIET!"" He shouts, tears forming in his eyes and slowly making their way down his face. His own children had died at a young age and it left a hole in his heart that may never be opened again. ""Bring da armies, weesa marching to war!""""Gather your troops and march to the great plains. There the enemy will gather, from the cities, away from their defenses and allowing the Naboo to be freed as well."" Maul says.Good, Naboo has their Army, but Maul feels strangely... betrayed. He doesn't know why. Betrayal means that you would have trusted that person, but there is an anger to Sabé that haven't been there before... and hurt.Maul doesn't want to run her through but he feels a genuine lost of trust that has been there before.Anakin Skywalker has been feeling a coldness that permanents there. It's worse than his talk with Padmé back on Tatooine as they left the planet. A voice is whispering so badly into his head, and his eyes slowly begin to close. Sweats start going down his face, dampening his clothes...Anakin twitches wildly, something wet going down his eyes as a intense pain forms in his forehead beyond anything he ever went through before, until he recognizes the figure of Maul approaching. By now, Anakin is gasping for air, convulsing and trembling...""Maul... Help me!""Maul places his hands on his shoulders. ""Skywalker, what is it?""""Something... is there. It wants to draw me in!"" Anakin exclaims.Maul's hands on his shoulders successfully keeps him up, maintaining his footing. Maul stretches out and feel... He detects a intense darkness that hasn't been there before wrapped around the Chosen One, destined to leave the boy into total loneliness and helplessness, something that the Zabrak feels compelled to not allow for some strange reason.Darth Plagueis's signature is there in his dark glory.""Close your eyes,"" Maul commands, placing a hand on the boy's head. The child would not become Plagueis's slave!In his head, he can feel a loud commanding voice, moving through the boy's mind effortlessly.
""DON'T TRY TO RESIST IT, BOY!""
Maul snarls as he presses against the darkness in his head. Sensing the problem, Qui-Gon also does so, using the meditation tricks that Qui-Gon has taught him previously throughout the years. At a command from his Master, Obi-Wan does so as well. It take a combined effort of Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Maul to finally ground the boy's mind in check so he wouldn't have been seduced.The boy's mind finally closes him out, and Maul stands up, sensing that the Sith have let up for now. The Sith is finding it really difficult to not allow his predatory instincts to slip through, wanting vengeance yet again for the boy... strangely. To think, Maul was willing to serve the same Order who is sadistic enough to use a little boy to fulfill their plans.The Sith currently needs a lot of changes or a absolute demolition.""I'm going to kill him,"" Maul promises darkly, murmuring a bunch of curses in various different languages, each that Anakin clearly recognizes given how many times he flinches.""Maul-"" Qui-Gon begins to speak.""Silence,"" Maul replies, waving his hand to shut down any argument. ""You forget I am no Jedi.""Obi-Wan comes forward to stand aside Maul. ""I may not view Anakin too positively, but at the end of the day, he is just a kid. A kriffing kid! I stand alongside you, Darth Maul.""""Darth Plagueis is a scientist at heart. Either, he would want the boy as a Apprentice or he would want to conduct experiments on the boy given his Force Potential,"" the Zabrak elaborates. ""He may not prefer torture as much as my former Master, but he is still a Sith through and through. Plagueis cannot leave here alive or the boy would be targeted for the rest of his life.""""Are you suggesting that he is more sympathetic than his Apprentice?"" Obi-Wan asks, crossing placing a hand on his chin, recording everything that is being currently told to them about Plagueis.""No,"" Maul replies before beginning to elaborate what he knows of his Master. ""Plagueis is worse than his Apprentice in all manners. Sidious may have been corrupted from the beginning and prefer torture methods, but Plagueis is the Dark Lord of the Sith and can manipulate you into a state of total helplessness. Plagueis even considered to run research on your Grandmaster at one point. While many would prefer to die from Plagueis, it does not change the fact that he is still a monster and thus the greater threat.""Silence passes for a moment before the Queen of Naboo approaches with her Handmaidens.""You must command your people,"" Maul demands, staring at her with his yellow eyes. ""We have felt a disturbance in the Force. Someone is waiting for us at Theed and he would slaughter us all. You must go underground.""""I would fight for all my subjects, and as far as I am concerned, you are each not only my subjects but also friends,"" Padmé replies defiantly, irritating the Zabrak slightly.""Possibly confronting Plagueis can result in Gunray to continue to rule,"" Maul replies, also acknowledging the fact that his grandmother isn't a Jedi nor is her aides. They would all be putting themselves at risks. ""I don't want you to go into danger like that, your highness.""Maul storms away, feeling as Sabé's eyes bear into the back of his skull with saddening eyes.Maul stares at Padmé, the Queen of Naboo. Or rather, would it be more appropriate to call her Sabé, the Queen's loyal bodyguard? He'd planned to have words with that irritating little spitfire when she was alone. Her red robes make her... endearing, and the Zabrak doesn't know why he feels all sorts of emotions surrounding this blasted woman.""You lied to me,"" he tells her directly and without care, a slight tinge of rage colouring his words. All of the Guards turn to look at them.Padmé or rather Sabé's smile is sweet and vaguely ironic. If she had been offended or otherwise moved by his words, she didn't show it.""Let me make it up to you then. Come with me."" Sabé says.One of the Officers moves to protest with a wary glare to Maul yet he is silenced with a simple flick of the false Queen's wrist.""Officer Jannick, I am not threatened by this man. We'll be okay."" The Captain thinks about it for a moment.Maul stares at the Officer and sighs. ""Don't follow on my account. We'll be fine.""Sabé actually chuckles a bit at that comment. So the woman can show emotions after all? Interesting...The Officer nods at the woman's order and leaves them on their own. ""Follow me.""The Zabrak does so, giving her a disbelieving stare. Is she no better than his former Master who lied to him as well throughout the majority of his former life?""You could have addressed me privately, you know,"" Sabé says, crossing her arms across her chest and regarding him with a smirk.""You lied to me,"" Maul repeats the words from earlier, this time with more anger. ""You are nothing but the Queen's protection, her loyal bodyguard... an emotionless copy of the real thing...""""In my defence why would I trust someone who I just met with such a secret?"" Sabé asks cheekily but slightly defensively.Maul sneers. ""I can see it now. If I came on board, each of your Handmaidens would have been captured, yet there would have been hope as it would have been you who signed the treaty. The forged signature would have been invalid, unless Nute Gunray tried to paint things differently.""Sabé nods but that is not the heart of the matter.Maul senses it. ""Additionally, I can sense her protection is something that you heavily value.""""I-"" Sabé hesitates hesitantly, not sure how to explain her relationship with Padmé to a total stranger. ""I would do everything I can do to keep her safe but sometimes it doesn't feel like I do enough to satisfy her.""The Zabrak crosses his arms across his chest, predicting what is to come. ""You have a question.""Sabé seems nervous briefly before... ""Maul do you have any siblings?""Maul recalls when Savage was stabbed through, his horrified expression...""Yes,"" he admits. ""I left them behind years ago...""Sabé is shocked by the pain in his voice but she prompts. ""Would you die for them?""""Perhaps,"" Maul replies abruptly, though he knows the answer to that question already.""You-"" Sabé hesitates yet again, ""I... What happened to them?""Maul snarls. Usually pain fuels him but instead now he is angrier than before. ""I was the best of us all. My former Master sensed it. My memories were wiped. I don't remember my parents but my brothers were means for his disposal."" Why is he telling her all this?""Oh, what were their names?""Crippling agony...""My past is only for me to know,"" the Zabrak continues, surprisingly not as hostile as before but rather solemn, and before Sabé could have pressed further, Maul continues in a bitter tone. ""I can sense that you are a good fighter. It will be a shame if your use for the Queen expires...""Sabé shivers, and she can tell he is not threatening. ""Are you suggesting that Pad- the Queen would ever abandon me?""""Yes,"" Maul replies bluntly, the usual tone back now and the expression as cold as ever. ""Do you have any other ambition outside of being a servant?""""I don't,"" Sabé admits. ""Being a Handmaiden pays heavily and being close to the Queen also work."" She stops herself before deciding to push only a little further. ""Do you after you stop doing whatever you're doing now?""""No.""""Perhaps returning to your brothers and maybe your forgotten mother? Quit being whatever this Sith is and taking it easy?"" Sabé asks.""The former is a possibility. The latter... I admittedly don't know."" Maul admits before motioning back to the others with one indication of his hand. ""Shall we return before our presence starts to be missed?""Maul does have a point. After all, the fight will begin soon, and as much as she wishes to continue this conversation, Sabé knows that she has to finish her duty.Save Naboo...""Yes, I suppose we shall.""After the brief argument, Maul watches from the back as the Nubians and Gungans begin to assemble. He does not participate in their preparations, merely standing back after they have went to woodlands to begin planning. He did catch one of the other Queen's Captains mentioning that the Federation's army is much larger and stronger than anticipated.But that isn't his concern to be honest. He moves to sit down next to a tree and closes his eyes, stilling his mind and focusing. He also keeps a close eye on Skywalker who doesn't seem to be showing any other disturbing attitude despite what happened earlier. Plagueis must have quit looking at the boy's potential spawned by the Force - unlikely! - or wants to kill them all first before conducting with his plans for what he craves to do with the boy.""Skywalker, stay behind me under any means necessary,"" Maul says sharply, knowing that by all rights the boy should have stayed on Coruscant. There is no point dwelling as he is here now.
You know he is kinda...
""Are you going to be alright against this Plagueis guy?"" Skywalker asks, and Maul feels his chest catching in on itself as if he is about to collapse at the boy's fear.""Yes, I have trained for many years to keep myself safe,"" Maul retorts, knowing that he shouldn't be so dismissive, but also not liking anyone fondling over him for so long.
Ugh cute! There! I said it!
Anakin nods, but says nothing else. His fear for him is still palpable. It also reinforces his opinion that he really wouldn't do well in the Jedi Order. He fears and cares too readily. It is a strength but also a weakness, depending on whether one's loved ones come to harm or fell in danger.Given his own troubles, Maul knows he cannot take him in, despite how some strange part of him wishes to do so. He shall feast upon this bond and assure that the Jedi doesn't do too much harm to the boy's mental status.Maul has no time to alleviate his concerns as they move out, hopping on speeders to get them to the capital city of Theed. Perhaps this is for the best; a few mere Guards wouldn't be able to keep Skywalker safe at the overwhelming of the Droids. Besides, the Force is with him, and it wouldn't allow him to be harmed...Hopefully...They break off into small groups. He stays with the Jedi and the Queen, keeping himself protectively in front of Skywalker as the Queen fires a small blinking light at one of the other groups sneaking past the Droid patrols in Theed.Jinn kneels down in front of Skywalker and speaks softly, ""Once we get inside, find a safe place to hide and stay there.""""Sure,"" Skywalker answers sheepishly, and Maul knows instantly that he WILL NOT do that.He is moderately amused when Jinn seems to have noticed it too. ""Stay there.""Then there is no more time for words as the distraction group opens fire, blowing up a Trade Federation tank and causing hell to break loose. Maul ignites his lightsaber first and move to the side of the palace, parrying blaster bolts and dealing with any Droid that come near. Kenobi and Jinn follows, lightsabers activated, but not prepared.Maul has to admit part of him miss being in battle. He ought to ask the Queen of Naboo if he can take the dismantled Droids on a later date. Okay! Maybe a little part of him wants to experiment on the prototype Confederacy Navy of the past.Maul, Jinn, and Kenobi lead the group as they make their way into the palace hanger. Maul assures that the fake Queen is not harmed, not knowing why he feels so obligated to keep her safe.""Anakin, cover, now!"" Jinn shouts, obviously sensing the threat as well.The boy dives away as the battle persists and the Queen command her pilots to their ships.Maul continues to move through the onslaught of Droids, knowing what this must seem in the perspective of the Jedi.It would be hilarious as well as terrifying to see a Sith standing alongside his ancient enemy to those who knows the history, but these days proves that even the impossible can happen.Hell, Maul time traveled from a time long passed!Maul merely deflect the blaster bolts away from his allies, calling off the Dark Side as he cuts through them in mere seconds.The Zabrak turns back, and the conflict returns in blinding fury. The Sith wants nothing but to bathe himself in the blood of the ones behind all of this. He curses the Sith Master who is attempting to take advantage of him from afar...""Don't think too much. It's not that bad."" The monster murmurs in the back of his head, and Maul takes several steps back. ""Come now, you can still be my student. My Apprentice wants you dead and would hunt you for life. I, however, can see the potential in you still, and that Sidious was wrong to limit you in such a way. You don't have to be my enemy. Join me and I will complete your training.""And the words are so tempting that Maul almost finds it difficult to not turn his lightsaber on Kenobi and Jinn. He can easily take Skywalker as his Apprentice, serve as the mentor he needs...His influence is already on the boy after all...The Dark Side swells powerfully, and Maul's eyes burn hotly. Darth Maul thrust a lightsaber inside of a Droid's abdomen before redirecting the strike to another Droid, chopping the machine's head off. He can imagine Jedi in their place, their desperate stares as they continue to try to back away from the animal going for them, before Skywalker approaches amongst all corpses, his blue lightsaber lit, an angry expression painted across his face...""You're a monster!""Stop! Maul is fighting within himself. Blast it all!
""Kneel! Just recognize your power and join me. We can start our own Sith Order, one far better than the Jedi.""
Maul finds it harder and harder to keep himself from breaking down and accepting the offer. This Sith needs to die today or else the voice may never go away! The demons that is the Dark Side is still tearing against him!The hanger is cleared in short order, the Naboo Guard dealing with the last of the Droids. Numbly, Maul steps in front of them, his lightsaber still activated. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan eyes him curiously, the younger's eyes more cautious...""Maul, are you alright?"" Qui-Gon asks, seeming slightly worried on his behalf.Maul fights harsher against the voice that reignites his Sith Assassin's instincts. Plagueis knows he can reach that side of him, no matter which future he comes from.""No,"" Maul replies in a shaky voice, feeling cold as he regards both men.
""Kill them both.""
""Yes!"" The Sith Assassin and untamed animal yells within him.""No!"" Maul shouts, causing everyone in the hanger to look at him.Maul cradles his head with both of his hands, trying to keep the voices out, as he speaks in a raspy tone. ""Jinn, it seems that the Dark Lord is trying to find a way to gain access to my mind. He wants me to serve him. H-he wants me to kill both of you.""Now, both Jedi's eyes go wide-""Are you feeling tempted to?"" Kenobi asks worriedly. He can excuse the boy for not knowing how to refuse the Sith given how experienced he us, but he cannot excuse a man who is clearly excelled in the Force, especially the Dark Side.""Obi-Wan,"" Qui-Gon says in his scolding voice, causing the younger man to shift slightly, before approaching Maul wearily and taking his lightsaber hilt away from him. ""Don't let him win. He wants to use you.""Maul does so, feeling Jinn's support. Although they don't have a Force Bond, they still do have respect for one another somewhat, and that is enough. At least it should be...""I am still weak emotionally,"" Maul states solemnly, staring at the ground, wondering if he should have just remained on Coruscant... with Sidious. ""I-I am worried that if I confront him, he would corrupt me.""It is as he fears. It would take the older Maul time before he can crush that side of him that still wanted blood.""Red group, blue group, everybody this way!"" a Guard Captain calls out, putting an abrupt end to the conversation, though the concerns are still there on the Jedi.""Hey! Wait for me!"" Skywalker's voice comes as he peeks out of the cockpit.The murmurs surprisingly go away at that voice, drawing Maul's confusion.
The boy...

The boy...
Anakin...""Anakin stay there,"" Jinn commands as they moves for a set of blast doors, ""You'll be safe there.""""But I...,"" Begin Skywalker.""Stay in that cockpit,"" Jinn repeats sternly, pointing at him strictly, making the boy scowl a bit and pout.The doors open, and Maul shudders as he stares at the door. In another reality, Maul would have been standing there waiting for them and prepared for battle, wanting to cut the whole Naboo party down, including the Jedi. They would have all separated at the command of the Queen, leaving the Jedi alone.Now, Maul is on the side of the Queen, but that does not mean they are not without total threat. Several Droidekas are instead standing in front of them in replacement of the Maul from the former timeline, and Maul instantly reacts, raising them into the air, crushing them immediately. The Nubians stare with awe and even Kenobi's face breaks in shock.They make their way through, surprisingly without resistance. Maul can still feel the echoes in his head, but Jinn and Skywalker's (unintentional) support is really helpful. He can only hope that more of the Jedi will become like Jinn in the future despite his ignorance.Maul feels the shadows as he moves through the corridors...Something dark...Getting closer and closer.""You know that he is in there,"" Maul tells the two Jedi. ""Are you ready?""""We're ready,"" Jinn answers for both of them, his hilt in his hand.Maul opens the door slowly, predatory eyes looking around, before motioning to Jinn and Kenobi who comes in, lightsabers activated. He expects to see the Sith Lord in the middle of the Throne Room, waiting for them, instead all he sees is the chair of the Queen flipped around and facing the opposite direction.Kenobi and Jinn follows suit, surprised likewise at the lack of enemy present.""Are you sure he's here?"" Naberrie asks in a whisper.Maul responds. ""He is. I can feel it.""""Greetings, Queen Amidala, I have been waiting for you."" The figure sounds like Gunray but something is... off. Maul cannot help but feel a big surge of 'wrong' in the Force...Droids enter the Throne Room, their blasters primed to their direction. Each of them keep their lightsabers up, the Naboo party also training their blasters on the Droids. The Droids will not fire unless commanded and Maul, in truth, is trying to find a way out of this one.Not caring that he can be shot, Panaka walks ahead of the Guards, aiming his blaster at the figure sitting in front of them on the Queen's chair. The fact that someone is sitting in the chair of the Queen and going against many cultures is insulting for all of the Nubians there.The real Queen feels a massive ego rise. She is the Queen of Naboo, meant to sustain those traditions. Should they discover the disgusting sight, some of her people will shame her for allowing someone who is not Nubian to sit in that chair. Hopefully, that embarrassment wouldn't escape those who are present.Regardless, Panaka is still loyal to the end, and so are his Guards, who give the figure the most disgusted look she has ever seen from the man.""Nute Gunray, you are under arrest for your crimes against Naboo, the death of multiple natives, the torture of others, and your illegal blockage against our planet. Turn around and submit to Naboo's custody or suspect to be forced to!"" Panaka shouts with barely constrained rage, and Maul can see that he just wants to open fire, despite how it will label him as a murderer.He continues to shout for Gunray to follow his orders until the chair swivels around, and a Muun with a respirator is staring at them all, causing the Captain to instantly stop shouting. Fear paralyzes his whole being.The Muun almost looks like he takes pity for a moment. ""Why so serious?""Darth Plagueis cackles.




Notes:

Arthur's note: Unlike my past fics, I'm changing everything around. I love Jar Jar but I want a less humourous fic and down to earth type of fic. This is a Darth Maul with PTSD fic and is very serious to the point where he may take jokes literally. Honestly, I'm like that irl due to past trauma sometimes, and I don't think I can ever recover from that.Asajj Ventress returning to Dooku? What? Didn't she die in the Dark Disciple novel? Yes in Disney Canon, but in the EU continuity, she'd returned to carry out his bidding, not imagining a life beyond serving Dooku. I'm pretty sure you are all like why would she do that and I was too at first? And yet I pose how many times do abused individuals return to their abusers no matter what they did to them? Like Vader did with Sidious? Like Maul did with Talzin? Surprise surprise, Asajj was abandoned by Dooku again in the Battle of Boz Pity, but it's understandable to return to abusive people through manipulations and misplaced sense of loyalty, no matter what they do to you.Just realize throughout writing this EU Asajj Ventress never had a chance to redeem herself and was left adrift in a unknown part of the galaxy as she have lost everything she'd loved due to blind faith in Dooku. :( I kinda wish they did follow something like that path in the new show, possibly setting up a Luke and Asajj meeting in the near future. I hate the Dark Disciple novel and feel like the Quinlan x Ventress ship was so incredibly forced so I settle her returning to Dooku and having her fate be yet unknown in the original timeline.Eh, take it or leave it.May the Force be with you all always."

A woman stands in her place before a hushed crowd. Murmurs ripple through the people before her, and though she cannot hear them she knows what they speak of. She knows what they see. 

She is a beautiful woman, she who stands before this room of life. Her curves are gentle, her face both soft and sharp, cheekbones high but jawline slight. She is a beautiful woman, she whose hands, if one could see them closely, are delicate but quick, slender as her figure and perhaps even more elegant. She is a beautiful woman, she whose eyes are the color of the sky as it darkens before a storm. She is a beautiful woman, but behind the mask of pride she wears is something else. 

For she is a broken woman, she who stands here waiting for a fate that will certainly tear her apart. She is a broken woman, she whose eyes are tired, burning with a spark of despair. She is a broken woman, who searches herself for any defense for the undefendable. She is a broken woman, waiting and waiting for any hope.

 She is a broken woman, and she knows that there is no hope. 

But all these things do not matter, because in the end only one remains. 

She is a mother.

It is a mother who stands here. It is a mother who bites her lip and thinks of a baby girl who waits for her on Arkanis, a baby girl who might never see her again. It is a mother whose eyes sweep through the crowd, a mother whose breath hitches in her chest. It is a mother who wonders if anyone will care enough and a mother who wonders if one heroic deed is enough to grant her a life with her child. It is a mother who stands before the Republic. It is a mother who does not know the future, but fears it. 

Fear, she knows, is the absence of control. Fear is weakness. And in that moment, though she feels so many things, her own, suffocating weakness burns nearly the strongest, outmatched by only one thing. 

It is her fear that amplifies it. It is her fear that fights a winning battle against her ability to rationalize herself out of this, but it is also her fear that keeps her from lying to herself. Nothing can stop this truth. There is no hope, no lie, no distraction from it. And though she tries to hope she might not remain so, she can no longer lie to herself. 

No stars will shine upon her face.

Because she is alone, and there is no one to save her. 

Not even herself."

Chapter Text
Boba stared at the small object in his hand, wrapped in a piece of cloth. This was it. After all this time, almost a year of searching, he'd found it. An artifact he'd read about a long time ago, back when his buir was still alive. An artifact that could, supposedly, be used to bring back lost loved ones.After the jetii Windu had killed Buir, Boba had been tempted to go after him. To track him down and destroy him for what he'd done. But then he remembered the artifact...and decided it would be worth it to try and bring his father back.It hadn't been easy. He'd talked to many strange and disreputable individuals, and few believed the thing existed. But he was a bounty hunter, and the son of Jango Fett. He knew how to find things that wanted to stay hidden and, finally, he had.Ever so gently, he unwrapped the disk-shaped stone from the cloth and laid it on his bunk in Slave I. ""Okay. This better work."" He let out a long breath and closed his eyes as he laid his hand on the object. ""Bring me Jango Fett. Bring me Jango Fett. Bring me—""He yanked his hand back with a cry. It felt like it had been burned. Then he stared at the artifact with wide eyes. It was glowing, strange markings tracing their way along the surface. Slowly, it floated off the bunk and started spinning.""It's working,"" Boba whispered. Then he laughed. ""It's working!""Part of him had still doubted that it would. The artifact had something to do with the Jedi's Force, and Buir had never put much in the words of Jedi. But it was working! He was going to see his father again. After a year apart, he'd be able to throw himself in Buir's arms. Buir would hush him and dry his tears and promise him uj'alayi. And they'd be happy again.Then there was a flash of light and a loud whooshing sound followed by absolute silence.Boba blinked. He couldn't see anything after the flash. But...he thought he saw movement. Then there was a voice, murmuring words he couldn't quite catch. He wasn't alone!Tentatively, he stepped toward the direction of the voice. ""Buir?"" Jango Fett fought hard. He always did. Always had. It was the only way to survive. Jaster Mereel was nearby, fighting just as hard. The Mand'alor was a sight to see when he fought in full armor and Jango's heart burst with pride for his buir. He could only hope that, one day, he'd be half the man he was...and half the father.It was funny, if he thought about it too hard. He never really thought about his birth father anymore. It was too painful to think about his old family. He was closer to his adoptive buir than he'd ever been with his first aliit. Jaster was a hard man. He had to be, as ruler of his people. But he also had a gentler side that few ever saw, even Jango.The battle was drawing to a close as the enemy forces were fleeing. Jango felt a rush of satisfaction at the sight. The haat Mando'ade had won the day.""Jango.""Jango instinctively straightened as his buir approached, nodding in greeting. ""Mand'alor.""Jaster removed his buy'ce to give Jango one of his rare smiles. ""You fought well, ner ad.""Jango let a smile cross his face at the praise as he removed his buy'ce as well. ""Thank you Buir.""""You get stronger every day."" Jaster pulled him into a keldabe and Jango closed his eyes, enjoying the contact. ""You will make a fine leader.""Jango didn't reply. He didn't really think he would make a good Mand'alor. If he was honest with himself, the idea frightened him a bit. But he'd never admit it out loud.Jaster sighed. ""We'd better finish mopping up this mess.""""Elek Buir.""Jaster placed his helmet back on his head and Jango did the same. Then he began to follow the Mand'alor. But he only made it a few steps before he froze, an odd sensation sending a shiver up his spine. After a moment, his buir realized he was no longer there.""Jango?"" He turned back. ""What is it?""""I..."" Jango blinked. ""I don't know. I feel...strange.""His buir returned, concern lacing his voice. ""Do you need to see a baar'ur?""""Maybe...""But before they could do anything, Jango cried out, crumpling over in pain. It felt as if he'd been yanked in all directions at once. Then a flash of light temporarily blinded him and a whooshing sound filled his ears. He thought he heard his buir calling his name, but he couldn't be sure. He wasn't sure of anything anymore. A moment later, he realized he was grasping Buir's hand with all his strength, terrified of what would happen if he let go. Then, just as quick as it had come, it all ended. Jango blinked, unable to see anything but darkness for a moment.When his vision returned, it was to see the grimacing face of his buir. ""Ad'ika?"" he whispered. ""Are you okay?""Usually, Jango would have bristled at the affectionate term. He was a man after all, no ik'aad. But he just clutched his buir's hand tighter. This was all so strange, he was just relieved Jaster was there for him. Together, they'd be fine. Together, they could do anything.He glanced around and realized they were on a ship. It was a bit of a mess, but seemed nice enough. And it didn't seem like they were prisoners or anything. But...how exactly did they get here in the first place?Buir turned and looked as if he was going to speak. But before he could, they both heard a subtle shifting. They weren't alone.Jaster stiffened, reaching for his blaster. But then...""Buir?""They both turned to see a young boy standing before them, maybe 11 or 12 years old. He had curly black hair and brown eyes that were all too familiar...Jango saw them in the mirror every day. And right now, they were fixed on Jango.The boy's face split into a grin. ""Buir!"" He launched himself at Jango with a delighted laugh. Jango managed to catch him on instinct even as his mind tried to catch up with what was happening.They boy was continuing to babble, seemingly unaware of Jango's confusion. He had yet to give any indication that he'd even noticed Jaster's presence.""I knew it!"" The boy was practically vibrating with excitement. ""I knew it would work! You're alive!""Jango glanced at Jaster for help. But he seemed just as confused, staring at the boy without moving.""Um..."" Jango tried to think of something to say to this boy who could have been his twin at that age.""I missed you so much."" The boy squeezed him tighter before looking up and grinning.""I'm sorry, but..."" Jango shook his head. ""Who are you?"" On the other side of the galaxy, Obi-Wan Kenobi froze mid-battle as the Force practically screamed at him.""General!""Cody leapt to his side and shot a battle droid that had gotten too close. Obi-Wan shook his head, still trying to recover from the shock of what he'd just felt.""Thank you, Commander."" He pressed a hand to his head. ""And...apologies.""""Sir, are you okay?""Obi-Wan lowered his hand. ""Yes...I'm sure it was nothing.""He could sense his commander wasn't convinced, but they both put it aside for now. They had a battle to win, after all.Afterwards, when they were back to the safety of the Negotiator, Cody was quick to corner him.""General, are you sure you're okay?""""I'm fine."" Obi-Wan sighed. ""The Force was just...very loud for a moment.""Cody tilted his head. ""Is something wrong?""""I'm not sure if wrong is the right word,"" Obi-Wan said. ""But different. Something has changed. And I'm not sure what it means.""




Notes:

Hello everyone! This is an idea I've been thinking about for a while and finally decided I wanted to try and write it. I can't guarantee when I'll be updating as my other chapter fic is my priority right now, but I wanted to get this started.This is going to be overlapping with some Legends stuff. I'm mostly familiar with Jaster Mereel and the events of Jango Fett's early life through fanfiction, so I'm not sure how accurate I'll be, and some characters might be a little OOC. I'll do my best though. I'm also not entirely sure on the timeline, but I'm imagining Jango's somewhere around 20 years old here.Mando'a translations:Buir: parent; fatherJetii: JediUj'alayi: uj cake - dense, very sweet flat cake made of ground nuts, syrup, pureed dried fruit and spiceMand'alor: sole rulerAliit: clan; familyHaat Mando'ade: true MandaloriansBuy'ce: helmetNer ad: my childElek: yesBaar'ur: medicAd'ika: little one; sonIk'aad: baby

Chapter Text
Boba's hopes were dashed with those words. He felt his smile fade as he stared into Buir's face and...nothing. It was his buir. He knew it. He knew this wasn't a clone. But...how could his buir have forgotten him? He'd chosen Boba, out of millions of clones, to be his son. He'd told him he was special. He'd loved Boba. He'd never forget him.But...oh. Boba pulled away to back up a couple steps. Buir was...young. Younger than Boba had ever seen him.""No..."" Boba shook his head. ""But...this isn't right!""His not-buir just blinked at him, confusion in his eyes. He'd...he'd been so sure. But this must just be a clone. How could he have mistaken a clone for his father!A throat cleared and Boba nearly jumped out of his skin, spinning to see another man standing nearby. How'd he miss him? He was a stranger, but he was wearing full Mandalorian armor...the nicest set of armor Boba had ever seen, in fact. Then he realized not-Buir had also been wearing Mandalorian armor. So...he couldn't be a clone. They never wore beskar. So what did it mean?""Su'cuy ad'ika."" The stranger smiled at him, setting his helmet down on the bunk. ""There seems to be some sort of misunderstanding. Are you looking for your buir?""Boba just stared at him, mind spinning. He couldn't make himself move or even respond. How could everything have gone so wrong?The man sighed. ""Well, my name's Jaster Mereel, and this is my ad, Jango Fett.""Boba blinked. Then he blinked again. ""Ba'buir?"" Then he blurted out the only thing he could think of. ""You're dead."" Jango's stomach did a weird series of flips as his mind tried to catch up with the boy's words. First he'd called Jango Buir. Now he was calling Jaster Ba'buir and proclaiming him dead.""What?"" Jango cried.Jaster raised a hand, brow wrinkled in confusion. ""I think we need an explanation here."" He lowered his hand. ""Who are you?""The boy's eyes darted to Jango then back to Jaster. ""Boba."" He swallowed. ""Boba Fett.""Jango tried to get his tongue to work, he really did. But all he could do was stare at the boy.Then, Boba was stumbling away from them with a cry. ""No! This is all wrong! It was supposed to bring my buir back, my buir! Not....not some younger version of Buir!""There were tears in his eyes now as he shook his head, sobs shaking his body. And for some reason, something in Jango snapped at the sight, freeing his tongue and limbs.""It's okay ad'ika."" Before he knew what he was doing, he'd gathered the sobbing boy into his arms. ""We'll figure this out.""And the boy just clutched onto him like a lifeline. It melted Jango's heart and filled him with something he'd never felt before. After a few moments, Boba's cries quieted, but he still didn't let go of Jango.""There now."" Jaster placed a hand on Boba's shoulder. ""That's better. Why don't you start from the beginning?""Boba pulled back, tears on his cheeks, to stare at Jango. ""You're my buir.""""That's...not possible."" Jango shook his head. ""I never...""Boba shook his head. ""I think you're from the past.""Jango glanced up at Jaster to see shock mirrored in his eyes.Boba continued quickly. ""Buir was killed a year ago, and I've been on my own ever since. But I heard about this thing that could bring him back."" He gestured toward where a stone object was lying on the bunk. ""I...I thought it would bring you back the way I remembered you. But...""""It didn't."" Jaster nodded slowly.Jango glanced at him in shock. ""You actually believe this?""""Stranger things have happened."" Jaster sighed. ""So when you used the object, it brought your buir from some point in the past, and I got pulled along too.""Boba shrugged, not looking up. ""I guess so.""Then, it finally hit Jango. ""You're my ad."" His voice came out hardly more than a whisper. Boba still wasn't looking up, but Jaster was looking at him with pride in his eyes.""And you worried you wouldn't make a good buir."" He clapped his hand on Jango's back. ""Well done ner ad.""Jango managed a small smile before pulling Boba back into his arms, some buried instinct rearing its head and telling him to comfort his child.""Boba, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I haven't been there for you.""""Not your fault you were killed."" Boba's voice had changed, hope in it once more.""So I'm dead in the future too."" Jaster didn't sound like the idea bothered him much.""Yeah."" Boba nodded. ""Buir didn't talk about you a lot, but he really missed you. He didn't talk about his past much at all if he could help it.""""What about other family?"" Jaster asked. ""You're mother? Or any vode?For some reason, Boba tensed in Jango's arms at the question.""No,"" he said at last. ""No one.""Jango sighed and gently stroked Boba's back. ""Well...we're here now. I don't know how, or for how long, but I'm here for now ad'ika."" He paused for a moment. ""I'm sorry I don't remember. I really wish I did.""Boba didn't reply.""Boba?""Jaster chuckled. ""Poor kid. He's completely exhausted. Guess I'm not surprised, assuming his story's true.""Sure enough, Boba's eyes were closed and his breathing was evening out.""Don't worry Boba."" Jango murmured into his hair. ""I'm here."" Meanwhile, in a nearby system, Anakin Skywalker was trying to recover from the shockwave he'd felt through the Force. Luckily, they weren't on a battlefield at the time. He hated to think what would have happened if that had been the case. To his surprise, he was suddenly called to a meeting of the Jedi council.""Masters."" He bowed his head toward their holograms. ""What's this about?""""Feel something strange, have you?"" Master Yoda asked.""Well...yes. A couple hours ago.""""As have we all,"" Obi-Wan said. ""I froze up in the middle of a battle.""""There has been a great disturbance in the Force,"" Master Windu continued. ""And as far as we can tell, you're the Jedi currently closest to the source. We believe in originated on Ord Mantell, not too far from your current position.""Anakin nodded slowly. ""Okay. And what do you want me to do about it?""""We are, as yet, unaware what this disturbance could mean,"" Master Koon said.""The source, you must find."" Yoda leaned forward.""And Anakin, we must reiterate, we have no idea what this could mean,"" Obi-Wan said. ""It might be dangerous.""Anakin scoffed. ""I'm sure I can handle whatever it is. Ahsoka's currently at the Temple, so I won't be dragging her into it.""""Still, take some of your men with you,"" Obi-Wan said. ""Better to be safe than sorry.""Anakin sighed. ""Alright then. I'll get some of the guys together and we'll go take a look.""Obi-Wan nodded. ""Since the 212th has just completed our campaign, Commander Cody and I will be joining you as soon as possible.""Anakin fought not to roll his eyes. ""Master, I'm sure I can handle this.""""Agree with Master Kenobi, I do,"" Yoda said.""A disturbance so great in the Force is unprecedented,"" Master Koon continued. ""It would be wise to have backup.""""Fine."" Anakin crossed his arms. ""I'll meet you there Master.""Yoda nodded. ""May the Force be with you.""The holograms blinked out and Anakin quickly found his captain. ""Something's come up Rex. The Council wants us to investigate a disturbance in the Force that originated in a nearby system.""""A disturbance?"" Rex didn't sound happy about that.""We're...not sure what it means. Probably nothing, but we're to check on it as soon as possible, and Obi-Wan is on his way with Cody as well.""Rex nodded slowly. ""I'll get some of the boys together.""""Thanks Rex."" Anakin smiled. ""I'll meet you in the hanger.""Rex nodded and quickly walked off.Anakin's smile faded once Rex was gone. Though he was trying to ignore it, the Force was telling him that the Council was right. Whatever had happened, it was going to change some things in big ways.

Chapter Text
Boba woke laying against an armored body. He just sighed and curled tighter against his buir. One would think it wouldn't be comfortable, sleeping against armor like that, but Boba had always enjoyed it. It meant his buir was home and safe and looking after him.Then he opened his eyes as he remembered. His buir was dead. This man...was he still Buir? He didn't remember Boba. He didn't remember many years of his life. He certainly didn't remember becoming the donor for a clone army and requesting an unaltered clone to raise as a son.The thought made Boba swallow hard. He remembered a time long ago, when he was just a little kid. He'd sneak out of his room and meet with some of the other cadets who appeared to be his age. It was so long ago, it was all a bit of a blur. They'd been distrustful of him, that he remembered. But there'd been a few older cadets who'd eventually warmed to him, treated him like one of them. There was one in particular, but his name slipped Boba's mind.But then, Buir had caught him. He'd given the cadets a strict warning and they'd hung their heads, looking scared. Boba hadn't understood why Buir was mad at his brothers. After that, Buir had taken him to his room and had a serious talk with him. He'd told him the clones weren't his brothers. They weren't Jango's sons. Boba was different. He was special. The others would grow fast and die young. But Boba wouldn't. He was far more important than any of them could ever be. None of them were aliit.And Boba had listened. After that, any time he saw clones, he stood straighter and kept his distance. One time he thought he'd caught one of the cadets who'd been nice watching him sadly, but Boba had ignored him. He was the son of Jango Fett. He was special. He'd been chosen out of all of them.But...this version of Buir didn't know that. Neither did Ba'buir. They didn't even know Boba was a clone. Jaster had asked about other family, about vode. That had been the first moment Boba had felt that fear.What if, when Buir found out he was a clone, he would no longer see Boba as a son? What if he saw him as no different from the millions of men who shared his face? What if he didn't love Boba anymore?And that was why they couldn't find out the truth. Boba couldn't lose this again.A soft chuckle made him glance up to find Jaster Mereel watching them fondly. Boba smiled back, then glanced up to find Buir was asleep, breathing deeply.""How are you?"" Jaster asked.""I'm fine."" Boba suddenly remembered who this man was and swallowed. ""Mand'alor.""""No need for that."" Jaster raised a hand. ""We're aliit. You can call me Jaster."" He smiled. ""I can't say I'd be opposed to being called Ba'buir.""Boba smiled nervously. ""Elek Ba'buir.""He heard a chuckle and glanced up to see Buir was awake. ""You have no idea how happy that makes him. He's been after me to find a nice girl and get him some bu'ade for some time now.""""Better late than never Jang'ika."" Jaster smiled. ""So, mind telling us where exactly we are?""""Ord Mantell."" Boba sat up. ""No particular reason. Just a good place to blend in.""Jaster nodded. ""You okay now ad'ika?""""I'm fine."" Boba smiled. ""Thank you.""Jaster was quiet for a moment before speaking again. ""And...if you don't mind me asking...what is the current state of the galaxy? Of Mandalore?""Boba flinched. He'd been hoping to avoid those questions. ""You won't like it,"" he said slowly.Jaster snorted. ""I figured. You don't have to tell me everything...or anything if you don't want. I was just hoping for an idea of what's going on these days.""Boba sighed. ""Well...Mandalore is now under the control of Duchess Satine Kryze and the New Mandalorians.""Buir groaned. ""How did that happen?""After considering for a moment, Boba just shrugged. He wasn't entirely sure of what had happened himself. Gilderaan, of course, where Buir was betrayed, and the Jedi massacred the haat Mando'ade. After that, Boba wasn't quite sure how the New Mandalorians came to power. Just that Buir had never been happy about it.""What about Kyr'tsad?"" Jaster asked.""Still active, but not in control of Mandalore. Not yet anyway.""They were quiet for a moment before Jango spoke again. ""What about the rest of the galaxy?""And Boba didn't really know what to say. There's a big war going on and an army of clones created using your DNA fights for the Republic. No, he wanted to put that part off as long as he could, even if Buir would probably find out eventually...assuming he stayed, that is.""Ther's a war between the Republic and a group called the Separatists. Mandalore is one of several neutral systems trying to avoid the conflict."" There. That summed it up pretty well without going into too much detail.""Hmm."" Jaster hummed thoughtfully, still staring off into the distance.Boba bit his lip. ""What are you going to do?"" Both men glanced down at him with surprise in their eyes. ""I mean...are you going to try to get back to your own time?"" Boba was scared of the answer.But before anyone could say more, they heard the distinct sound of a ship approaching. Rex hated when his general got these feelings. Really, he hated when any Jedi started talking about 'disturbances in the Force' and whatnot. Somehow, it always meant more trouble for him.Skywalker's current mood wasn't helping matters. They were in hyperspace, so he had nothing to do but pace in the Twilight's tiny cockpit. And it was beginning to drive Rex crazy.""Sir."" Fives stepped over to him. ""Did anyone say what this weird Force thing is about?""Rex sighed. ""I don't think the Jedi even know.""""Great."" Jesse rolled his eyes. ""It's going to be one of those missions.""""I actually think Force related missions are interesting,"" Echo said. ""Often a good chance to learn about the Jedi.""""Yeah, assuming you're not on the receiving end of some sort of Force nonsense."" Fives sighed. ""But Echo has a point. If anything, it won't be boring.""Kix glanced up from where he was looking at a data pad. ""Just don't any of you go and get more injured than you need to. I'd rather not have to patch anyone up today if I can help it.""""Don't worry."" They all jumped as General Skywalker joined them. ""I'm sure it's...nothing.""""No offence sir."" Fives crossed his arms. ""But you're not exactly convincing.""Skywalker sighed. ""I'm sorry. This is all...very unusual.""Jesse rolled his eyes. ""You're also not doing much to make us feel better.""A light started blinking, indicating they were coming out of hyperspace. Skywalker looked relieved and quickly took the pilot's seat, guiding them toward the surface of Ord Mantell. The place he landed appeared to be the middle of nowhere. But then, Rex noticed a ship...a very familiar ship, and swore under his breath.""What is it?"" Skywalker asked.""That's Fett's ship.""""But...Prime's dead,"" Echo said. ""So...""""Well, this is definitely the source of the disturbance."" Skywalker finished landing and stood up. ""Come on. Better go see what's going on here.""Rex sighed as he donned his helmet. Somehow, he didn't think this was going to end well. Jango watched from the cockpit as the ship landed nearby. He glanced down and found a horrified expression on Boba's face, but the boy quickly hid it away.""That's a Republic ship,"" Boba said.""Just what we need,"" Jaster grumbled. ""What can you tell us about them? Last I knew, the Republic had no standing army.""""They do now."" Boba swallowed. ""Led by the Jedi.""""Great."" Jango rolled his eyes. ""Jetii.""""What do we do?"" Boba asked.Jango glanced at his buir, wondering the same thing.""We talk to them."" Buir placed his buy'ce on his head. ""It appears we have no choice.""""No!"" Boba grabbed his arm. ""You can't!""Jaster's helmet tilted down and a blush formed on Boba's cheeks as he let go of his ba'buir's arm.""Buir didn't like the Jedi,"" he mumbled.""That may be,"" Jaster said. ""But they're here, and there's no getting around that. Besides, they might know more about all this.""Boba glanced up at Jango with pleading eyes. But Jango wasn't about to cross Jaster on this. And despite his misgivings about the Jedi, Buir might be right. They might know how to get them back home.
But what would happen to Boba then?
""He's right ad'ika."" Jango offered his son a comforting smile, slightly disturbed to see tears forming in the boy's eyes. ""We don't have much of a choice.""He donned his buy'ce and followed Jaster. After a moment, he heard Boba padding silently after them.They exited the ship just as a tall, young man with a jetii'kad hanging at his side stepped out of the other ship. Five soldiers wearing white plastoid armor followed closely. These must be the Republic's army. Their armor was decorated with blue markings, and one even had Jaig eyes. That caught Jango off guard. Were these Mandalorians? Their armor, while definitely different, had many similarities to Mandalorian armor.""Hello!"" The Jedi waved, and Jango was struck by just how young he was. ""I am Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. I'm sorry to disturb you.""""No trouble."" Jaster had a hand on his blaster anyway. ""What can we do for you?""""I know this is going to sound strange, but the Jedi Order has sensed a disturbance in the Force that originated from this area."" The Jedi crossed his arms. ""You...wouldn't happen to know anything about that would you?""""As a matter of fact, we would."" Jaster removed his helmet and stepped closer. ""It appears my grandson was attempting to use a Jedi artifact to bring his father, my son, back to life, and instead pulled both his father and me from the past.""The Jedi just stared at him for a moment, blinking. ""That..."" He sighed. ""Sounds about like my luck.""""I am Jaster Mereel."" Jaster bowed his head. ""In my time, I was ruler of Mandalore.""The stance of the soldiers behind the Jedi suddenly shifted and Jango could tell from the tilt of their heads they were speaking on internal coms.Jaster gestured him forward. ""This is my ad, Jango Fett.""Jango stepped forward and removed his helmet. All those from the opposite ship suddenly got disturbingly still. That is, until the soldier with the Jaig eyes ripped his helmet off to stare at Jango with wide brown eyes. And all Jango could do was stare back. This man...could have been his twin but for the buzzed blond hair on his head.""You're dead,"" he said matter-of-factly.To his horror, the other soldiers removed their helmets to reveal they all had the same face. Jango's face. Different tattoos and hairstyles, but all the same face. Beside him, Jaster had gone still. Boba made a strangled sort of sound as he hid behind them.Blond-Jango let out a long-suffering sigh and turned to the Jedi. ""You should have waited for Kenobi, General.""

Chapter Text
Jango's mind had gone blank. All he could do was stare at the men in front of him. The men that looked like him. Why did they look like him?It made no sense! He could think of absolutely no reason why, in the future, so many men would have his face.""Um...General?"" The Jango with the Aurebesh '5' on his temple glanced at the Jedi. ""What now?""The Jedi had an odd look on his face, like he was trying to puzzle out some sort of mystery. The other Jangos had various looks of confusion or nervousness on their faces.""Sir."" Blond-Jango turned to the Jedi. ""It might be a good idea to inform General Kenobi of these developments.""""Yes."" The Jedi nodded. ""Good idea Rex. I'll...go call him.""""Hold on a minute!"" Jaster stepped forward and Jango couldn't help but flinch at the tone of his buir's voice. ""What is going on here?""""I...know about as much as you do."" The Jedi sighed. ""In all honesty, I've never heard of the Force allowing for...time travel.""""Not about that."" Jaster turned to the soldiers, the Jangos. ""Who are you?""Blond-Jango straightened. ""CT-7567, Captain Rex of the 501st Legion.""The 5 Jango grinned. ""I'm Fives.""""Echo."" The man next to him nodded. ""CT-1409, ARC trooper.""""Jesse."" The Jango with a cog tattooed on his head gestured to the man next to him. ""This is Kix."" The symbol on his armor indicated he was a baar'ur.Jaster stared at them for a moment before turning to Jango as if comparing their faces. Jango didn't need to. He felt like he was looking in a mirror...five mirrors, to be precise.The Jango that most closely resembled him, Echo, was staring with wide eyes. ""You...you really are Prime?""Jango just blinked, confused by the term. But Jaster sucked in a breath.""You're clones.""Jesse rolled his eyes. ""Obviously.""""Clones?"" Jango could hardly hear his own voice as he blinked at the men. ""But...how? Why?""Blond-Jango, Rex, snorted. ""Believe me, we didn't have a choice in the matter.""""Jango's right."" Jaster glanced toward the Jedi then back to Rex, who seemed to be more in control of the situation than Skywalker was. ""How did this happen? Did Jango allow five clones to be created with his DNA?""Fives laughed. ""Five? Try five million.""""What?"" Jango breathed.""I...don't know specifics,"" Skywalker said at last. ""But...well...""After a moment, Rex sighed and locked eyes with Jango. ""You were hired to be the template for a clone army that would fight for the Republic.""Jango felt his heart sinking fast. He'd...sold his own genetic material? His blood?""No."" Jaster crossed his arms. ""You must be mistaken. Jango would never have allowed this.""Suddenly, Rex's face twisted into something that sent a shiver down Jango's spine. ""Don't you dare tell me that."" He clenched his fists.""Easy Rex."" Skywalker placed a hand on Rex's shoulder, but Rex shook it off.""Do you have any idea what me and my brothers went through because of you?"" His eyes were locked on Jango. ""We weren't even treated like people. We were products to you and the Kaminoans. Any brother who didn't meet their standards was murdered in the name of quality control.""Jango's mouth had gone dry as Rex took a step closer.""Just for little things. A slightly lower score. A cosmetic defect.""Jango's eyes couldn't help but dart to the buzzed blond hair.""And you never cared! Why would you? The only one you cared about was that brat Boba.""Somehow, Jango's eyes widened further. ""What?"" Boba wanted to scream. How dare these copies talk about Buir like that! They had no right!Then his name had come out, and his blood ran cold. All had frozen. The blond clone was breathing heavily as he glared at Buir. None spoke until the medic with strange patterns shaved into his hair stepped forward.""You said your grandson was responsible for this?"" He addressed Jaster.Jaster sighed. ""Yes."" Then he glanced down at Boba and shifted so the others could see him.Boba didn't speak, just put everything he could into glaring at the clones. The captain's face did something weird, a look of recognition followed quickly by annoyance. That was strange. Boba didn't remember talking to a blond clone, even when he'd hung around some of the older ones.""Boba."" He looked up to find Jaster watching him closely. ""This...might have been important to mention.""Boba just shrugged. ""Too complicated.""He snuck a glance at Buir, fearing the anger he might see. But Jango's expression was even more frightening. His eyes were wide and full of confusion and fear as he stared at the clones. Boba had never seen that look on his face before.""Why?"" He asked softly. ""I...why would I allow my own sons to be mistreated?""At that, the captain's face took a bewildered expression, and he stepped back. ""We're not your sons.""Everyone was quiet for a moment before the Jedi spoke up. ""Okay...I'm going to call Obi-Wan."" He grabbed the blond clone's shoulder. ""Come on Rex, you come too.""Rex just nodded and followed the Jedi back into the ship, confusion written across his face.The clone with the 5 glanced down at Boba with a curious look in his eyes. ""You are real.""Boba huffed at that. ""Of course I'm real!""The clone with the cog shrugged. ""We never knew for sure. There were only rumors.""""Rumors?"" Jaster asked.""Yeah."" The 5 clone crossed his arms. ""He was part of Prime's payment.""""What?"" Jango snapped.Boba clenched his fists. He didn't want them talking about him like that. He wasn't a product like them.""It was the one requirement Prime had before he agreed to take the job."" The most normal looking clone, Echo, glanced down at Boba. ""An unaltered clone to raise as a son and heir.""Boba felt his buir's and ba'buir's eyes lock on him immediately and ducked his head, angry and ashamed all at once.""Unaltered,"" Jaster repeated.""Yeah, no tampering with his DNA."" The 5 clone waved a hand. ""We were altered to be more likely to obey orders and work as a team than Prime was."" He grimaced a little. ""And we have accelerated aging.""""Accelerated aging?"" Jaster's brow furrowed. ""Just how old are all of you?""""The captain's ten standard,"" the medic said. ""We're all around eight or nine.""Buir made a strange sound at that. ""You're...you're just children."" Rex had to fight to not wring his hands as he stood next to General Skywalker for the holocall. How could things get any worse? Of all the things he was expecting, coming face-to-face with Prime was not one he could have prepared for. The encounter had left him shaken, feeling almost like a scared cadet hiding from the longnecks once more.A moment later, Cody and General Kenobi were in front of them.""Anakin."" Kenobi smiled. ""I take it you've found the source of the disturbance.""""We...have."" Skywalker glanced at Rex, looking lost for a moment, before turning back to the call. ""Apparently, Boba Fett accidentally used a Force artifact to bring his father and grandfather forward in time.""""What?"" Cody snapped. Rex stared at him for a moment. It wasn't like Cody to interrupt the generals like that, but they didn't seem to mind.""Yeah."" Anakin sighed. ""And I have no idea what to do!""Kenobi didn't look particularly disturbed by the news, just stroked his beard thoughtfully.""I see,"" he said at last. ""I...cannot say I know the best way to deal with this situation either.""""Are you almost here at least?"" Anakin asked.""We should arrive within a few hours.""Rex fought back a grimace. He'd give anything to have Cody at his side right now.""Rex?"" Cody was watching him carefully. ""Are you okay?""Rex just shrugged, not trusting his voice at the moment.""Why wouldn't he be?"" Kenobi's brow furrowed. ""If you don't mind my asking.""Cody shot Rex a questioning glance. After a moment, he nodded. He trusted the generals.""When we were cadets, the Kaminoans tried to have Rex decommissioned for being defective,"" he said quietly.Anger burned in Skywalker's eyes at his words. As soon as the Jedi had learned of decommissionings, they'd been horrified and done everything they could to put a stop to them.""I had been training with Prime some,"" Cody continued. ""And he seemed to like me more than some of the others, so I asked if he could do something about it.""""What did he say?"" Skywalker asked. Cody snorted. ""He said the death of one defective clone wouldn't make any difference and to stop bothering him with stupid requests.""Silence followed for a moment before Kenobi spoke again. ""Obviously, Rex was not decommissioned.""""Only because Cody convinced Alpha-17 to step in."" Rex swallowed. ""Trained with me until I could hardly move so that my scores were some of the best on Kamino. After that, the longnecks couldn't justify decommissioning me for just a cosmetic defect.""Anakin sighed. ""I see why you're so angry with Fett then.""Rex stood there for a moment before glancing up at Cody. ""He called us his sons.""Cody's eyes widened. ""What?"" he breathed.Rex just shook his head. ""He...he asked why he would have allowed his sons to be mistreated.""Cody's face was blank, but Rex could easily see the rolling emotions in his eyes.""Rex,"" Kenobi said. ""You have every right to hate the man. All of you do. But you have to understand, if this Fett is actually from the past, then many of the experiences that shaped who he was have not yet happened. He might actually be willing to treat you as sons.""""Forgive me General,"" Cody said. ""But that's not easy to believe.""""I understand."" Kenobi nodded. ""But...it might be wise to give him a chance. His father as well. They know nothing of your treatment on Kamino.""Rex nodded. ""Yes, General Kenobi.""""Well, we'll be there as soon as we can."" Kenobi turned back to Skywalker. ""Just...try to keep everything calm until we arrive.""""Yes Master."" Skywalker smirked. ""I'll do my best.""""Rex?"" Cody dipped his eyes. ""How is he?""Rex shrugged. ""Looked fine to me.""Cody just nodded. The generals shot them odd looks, but didn't comment on it. Then Kenobi and Cody were gone.Skywalker turned to Rex. ""He?""""Boba."" Rex sighed. ""Before Prime convinced him he was better than all of us, Boba was Cody's vod'ika."" He turned to Skywalker. ""And...technically...they're batchmates.""




Notes:

I've always liked the idea that Boba was part of a batch at one time, but the others all had accelerated aging. And I think Cody's supposed to be one of the oldest clones, so it would make sense that they could potentially be batchmates, but Boba is unaware of this.Mando'a Translations:Buir: fatherBaar'ur: medicBa'buir: grandparentVod'ika: little brother

Chapter Text
After they'd hung up with Rex and Skywalker, Cody just stood there staring where the holograms had been. He felt lost and confused, more so than he'd ever felt before in his life. And with how he was feeling, he could only imagine how much worse it was for Rex, who'd been face-to-face with Prime.Cody himself hadn't had any quarrels with the man when he was younger. However, the incident with Rex was a big one that had left him with nothing but anger toward Prime. If the longnecks had succeeded with decommissioning Rex, he would have hated Prime with a passion. He might even have tried to kill him himself. As it was, he'd felt neither joy nor remorse when he'd heard the man had died on Geonosis. He couldn't have cared less.""Cody?"" He turned to find General Kenobi watching him carefully. ""Are you okay?""""Fine, General.""But Kenobi kept watching him with a knowing expression and Cody sighed. It sure was hard to keep things from a Jedi.""You know I never intend to use the Force to learn things you would rather remain unsaid,"" Kenobi said. ""I would never do that to a friend. But...you're projecting pretty loudly.""Cody sighed. ""What am I projecting, General?""""Anger. Fear. Confusion."" He paused and tilted his head. ""Worry. That is probably the greatest one.""""This is all just..."" Cody took a deep breath. ""A lot to take in.""Kenobi observed him for a moment. ""I doubt Rex is in any danger. Even in the event that Jango or his father were to become violent, Anakin and several of your brothers are there.""Cody snorted. ""Rex can handle himself in a fight. That's not what I'm worried about.""Kenobi nodded slowly. ""You really care for him, don't you?""""I do."" Cody turned to Kenobi. ""I never told you much about my time on Kamino, did I?""""No. Only that commanders Wolffe, Fox, and Ponds are your batchmates. Although, I was under the impression that Rex was just as close as any of them are.""""He is."" Cody was quiet for a moment, considering his words. ""I don't mean to bother you with this sir. You have more important things to worry about.""""Please."" Kenobi sat down. ""If you need someone to listen, I would be glad to.""Cody wasn't usually one for sharing. But at the moment, he had the strange urge to talk to someone.""There were originally five in my batch,"" he said slowly. ""But one was left unaltered, payment for Prime.""Kenobi's eyes widened. ""Boba.""""Yes. He was taken away when we were very young, too young to remember. But Alpha-17 told us about him."" Cody smiled a little. ""Boba used to come to us, when his father was off-world. I don't think he knew we were batchmates, but I was always happy to see him. He was my vod'ika.""Cody shook his head. ""But then, Prime found out and threatened to have us decommissioned if we didn't leave Boba alone.""Kenobi was quiet for a moment. ""Do you know how Boba took this?""""Prime must have had a talk with him as well. After that, if I did see him, he always sneered at any clones he passed. It was obvious he thought he was better than us. All of us."" Cody closed his eyes for a moment. ""It hurt, to lose my vod'ika. That's why I refused to lose a second because of Prime.""""Rex?""Cody nodded. ""He was rejected by his own batch, because of his blond hair. I...found him hiding from the Kaminoans. Convinced Alpha-17 to let him join our squad, since we were one short anyway. It was unconventional, but we made it work. Rex became our honorary batchmate. And our vod'ika. But he was always closer to me than the others. He trusted me to protect him.""Kenobi stroked his beard thoughtfully. ""It sounds like this will be a stressful situation for both of you.""""Yes."" Cody sighed. ""It will."" He turned away, ready to be alone with his thoughts for a while. It wasn't like him, to open up this much. But everything that he'd heard left him in an odd mood. Besides, he considered Kenobi a friend. And he trusted him to help in any way he could.The silence was broken by Kenobi one last time. ""Do you think Boba will remember you?""For a moment, Cody felt his eyes tearing up. He remembered so clearly, the grinning young face that had watched him with such adoration. The boy bringing him a rough picture of a big and small stick figure and telling him it was for, ""the best ori'vod."" But that...that was a long time ago.""No."" Cody closed his eyes. ""I don't."" Most of the clones seemed really nervous around Jango. Jaster couldn't blame them, he supposed. Especially if what Rex had said was true, that Jango had treated them as...what was the word he used? Products?He just couldn't imagine his ad forsaking the Mandalorian code like that. Children were precious. And even if they didn't look it, that was what those men outside were. A Mandalorian would never allow a child to be mistreated. Still, that look in Rex's eyes, the fear and hate...it was hard not to believe him.What happened to you Jang'ika? He stared at his son, currently hiding away on Boba's ship. What happened to make you forsake our ways?Still, whatever Jango had done to these men...these boys...in the future, it hadn't happened yet. And right now, he was just as frightened about the whole thing as they were.Boba had locked himself away in the cockpit, and Jaster chose to leave him for now. He'd have to have a talk with the boy, but he'd give him a little time first. Jango was the one who needed him now.He slowly walked over and sat next to Jango on the bunk. It was a couple minutes before Jango spoke.""They're just children."" He shook his head. ""Boba's older than them, yet they're already fighting a war.""Jango looked up and met Jaster's eyes. ""How Buir? How could I have let this happen?""""I don't know Jang'ika."" Jaster turned so he was fully facing his son. ""But as long as we're here, you're going to have to do everything you can to make it right.""""How?"" Jango shook his head. ""You saw how they look at me. They hate me. They fear me! What kind of father's sons are afraid of him?""""They don't all fear you. I think Fives was more curious than anything.""""Rex does."" Jango wrapped his arms around himself. ""From what he said...I can guess what happened to him.""Jaster could too. A defective product was thrown out if it couldn't be fixed cost-effectively. Yet somehow, Rex had managed to survive. Jaster was glad. The boy was mandokarla, he could already tell. He had the right stuff, a strong spirit. And if there really were millions of these men made using Jango's DNA, Jaster was sure there were many more with a mando spirit.""Maybe you should try talking to him,"" Jaster said slowly.Jango huffed. ""I don't think he's interested in talking.""Jaster sighed. ""I know it's going to be hard, ad'ika, but it's the only way you'll find out how to right these wrongs.""Jango was quiet for a moment, head bowed, before he met Jaster's gaze.""You're right Buir."" He stood up, face growing determined. ""Whatever I did to them, I know I can never undo it. But I will make this right Buir, I promise.""

Chapter Text
Jango felt completely miserable. Talking to Jaster had helped. But at the same time, it had just made things worse. How was he going to make millions of men, of boys, trust him? He really had no idea.He'd thought talking to Boba might help. The boy didn't hate him, that was obvious. But he hadn't been seen since the others had mentioned that he was a clone. That only made Jango feel worse. It was like Boba thought he'd think less of him when he found out.In truth, he still hadn't quite wrapped his mind around the idea that he'd allowed himself to be cloned, millions of times at that. It was eerie, to stare into the faces of those men and see himself staring right back. No...not quiet himself. Even if they were identical, they each had unique quirks. He'd seen that within minutes of meeting them. Why hadn't he before?Slowly, he stepped outside the ship. Rex and the Jedi still hadn't emerged from their ship. The other clones seemed bored. The medic was sitting on the steps to their ship with a data pad, probably catching up on work. Another was sitting next to him, fidgeting with something in his hands. The last two were standing a little way off, locked in conversation. Probably about Jango.But none of these boys seemed to hold as much dislike for him as Rex had. And like Jaster had said, Fives had seemed more curious than anything. He was easy to recognize with the '5' on his temple, one of the two off talking by themselves. Their armor was slightly different from the others, obviously special forces of some sort.Well, if Rex was going to be difficult to talk to, maybe he'd start with someone easier. Jango took a deep breath and approached the two.The other one, Echo, if Jango remembered right, caught sight of him first and stopped talking, eyes locking on him immediately. Fives turned at his brother's reaction.""Hello Prime."" Fives smiled a little. ""How are you doing?""""As well as can be expected,"" Jango said. ""Certainly not what I expected to happen today.""""Yeah."" Fives laughed. ""Us too.""Jango was quick to notice that Echo was much quieter, and he seemed much more wary.""I just...was hoping we could talk for a bit."" Jango offered what he hoped was a reassuring smile. ""Did we ever meet? You know...before?""""Our batch saw you in passing once,"" Fives said. ""We were really little. Physically only seven or eight.""Physically. Jango hated that word.""Batch?""""We were grown in batches,"" Echo said.Fives' easygoing smile faded. ""Our three batchmates died on our first assignment. We're all that's left""""I'm very sorry,"" Jango said. ""That must have been hard.""Fives shrugged. ""We miss them, but we have the 501st now.""Jango nodded slowly. ""I can understand that. I hardly remember my birth family. They died when I was very young. But Jaster's been the best buir I could've asked for.""Fives smiled. ""Well...we didn't get a buir, but Rex is the best ori'vod.""Jango could definitely believe that. He'd seen the protective gleam in the blond clone's eye.""Anyway, can we help you sir?"" Fives asked.""You don't have to call me sir."" Jango swallowed. ""Like I said, I was just hoping to talk with some of you. It's obvious that I was..."" He weighed his words. ""Well, that I didn't treat any of you well.""""You didn't exactly treat us badly,"" Echo said slowly. ""Just didn't really care what happened to us.""""That's just as bad."" Jango sighed. ""I'm sorry. But I want to make it right now.""The pair exchanged a look that Jango couldn't read. But before they could reply, another voice cut in.""What do you want?""Jango jumped and turned to find Rex stalking over to them. That protective gleam was back in his eye, and he was quick to position himself between Jango and the others.""Just wanted to talk,"" Jango mumbled.""It's fine Rex,"" Fives cut in.Rex's eyes narrowed. Skywalker hadn't come out of the ship yet, and the other two clones were watching the interaction carefully.""Actually..."" Jango took a deep breath. ""I was hoping to talk to you too, if you wouldn't mind.""Rex stared at him a moment longer before turning and walking away. Well, he hadn't said no, so Jango assumed he was at least open to talking. He offered a quick smile to Fives and Echo before following the captain. Rex's heart was pounding. Why would Prime want to talk with him? It was because of his hair. It had to be. The man had already zeroed in on his defect.But he couldn't do anything about it. They weren't on Kamino. Rex was safe. Besides, he'd proven time and again that he was a valuable clone. Even the Kaminoans wouldn't decommission him now, not with his record. Still, he wished Cody would get a move on. All this would be easier with his ori'vod by his side.Once they were away from the others, Rex turned and faced Prime. He almost stood at attention on instinct, but instead took a stiff posture and crossed his arms, waiting for Prime to talk. He didn't trust himself to speak.Prime, to Rex's shock, seemed nervous. And also...Rex hadn't noticed before. But this Prime was young. He appeared no older than Echo and Fives, like a shiny fresh off Kamino.""I'm sorry,"" Prime blurted at last. ""Whatever he...I...did to you, to all of you, I just want you to know I'm sorry.""Rex just blinked, shocked.""It wasn't right,"" he continued. ""It's against the Mandalorian code. Children are precious. I should have been protecting all of you.""""We aren't children.""""You're ten years old!"" Prime shook his head. ""I don't care if you look like adults, you're just children. Child soldiers fighting a war. It's wrong.""And that really took Rex off-guard. He'd never really thought about it like that before. He didn't feel like a child. Then again, how would he know what it felt like to be a child? It's not like any of them had ever been given the opportunity on Kamino.This conversation was not going the way Rex had expected. Prime hadn't even mentioned his hair.""Rex?"" Prime stared at him. ""Are you okay?""""Why are you doing this?"" Rex's voice had dropped, and he wasn't even sure Prime would hear him. ""You aren't our father.""Prime flinched and dropped his eyes. ""Well...I should have been."" When he looked up, there was firm determination in his expression. ""You deserve a father, all of you. I swear to you ad'ika, I will make this right.""Rex's breath caught in his throat. Ad'ika. Little one. Son. He'd been Cody's vod'ika all his life, but he'd never been an ad'ika before.""For me...it's like we just met,"" Prime continued. ""It's like...I'm finding out about long lost sons that I never knew I had. And truthfully, that terrifies me. I'm nowhere near ready to be a buir, despite what Jaster says. But if you wanted it, I would say the gai bal manda, and adopt you here and now. You and all your vode.""And with those words, Rex's world completely turned upside down. They didn't bring him joy though. They terrified him more than anything. He...wouldn't know what to do with a father.""Still...I'm not sure any of us are ready for that yet,"" Prime said.""No.""Somehow, Prime looked both relieved and disappointed at the same time.""But...maybe at some point."" Prime let out a long breath.Rex swallowed. ""What about Boba?""""From what I can tell, he could do with some vode.""An awkward silence fell after that, neither sure what to say. Rex's anger toward the man before him had been replaced with utter bewilderment. None of this made sense in the slightest. Maybe it was like Kenobi said, and this Fett wasn't the same as the one they'd known.Luckily, they were saved from their silence by Jesse.""Rex."" He came running over. ""General Kenobi and Commander Cody are landing."" Boba stared out the cockpit window, fuming. Why was Buir bothering with the clones? Boba was his son, not them. Was it possible he didn't want Boba for a son now that he knew he was a clone? Did this past version of Buir prefer to have a full-grown son? After watching Buir talking with the blond clone a moment longer, Boba picked up a data pad and hurled it against the opposite wall.A quiet sigh made him stiffen.""I take it things haven't gone the way you wanted.""Boba sheepishly raised his eyes to meet Jaster's gaze. His ba'buir didn't look angry. More like sad.""Not really."" Boba crossed his arms.Jaster stepped closer to him. ""Why aren't you out there with your vode?""""They're not my brothers!"" Boba clenched his fists.""Is that so?""Boba turned away. ""Buir told me so. They're just made to die. I was made to be his son.""Jaster was quiet for a long moment. ""I'm sorry to hear that."" Somehow, his voice had grown even sadder. ""I would consider myself lucky to have so many brothers watching my back.""Boba wasn't sure how to respond to that. Why didn't his ba'buir understand? That wasn't what Buir had taught him.A moment later, Jaster sighed again. ""Well, Skywalker says his master's landing. Why don't you come out for a while? Might be able to help us explain things.""A shadow passed over at that moment as a ship descended to land nearby.""Fine."" Boba stalked out of the cockpit. Buir was walking over with the blond clone as the door to the new ship opened and two people stepped out.Boba froze when he saw the Jedi. He recognized him, the one who'd come to Kamino. Right before Buir...No! He couldn't think about that. At least this wasn't the Jedi who'd done the deed. He'd probably have killed the man right there.But then, his eyes caught on the face of the clone beside the Jedi. He had a thin scar curling around his eye. And for some reason, that made Boba feel something strange. Almost like being around Buir, but not quite. No, this was different. A far-off memory. That scar. He knew that scar. Then, finally, he remembered.
""Kote!"" He ran toward the older boy. ""Kote! What happened? '10 said you were dying!""
""I'm fine vod'ika."" The older boy smiled and ruffled his hair. ""Just had a little accident. At least the medics say I'll get a neat scar.""He threw himself at the other boy. ""I was worried! I'm glad you're okay ori'vod!""""Don't worry."" A firm hug was returned. ""I'll always be here for you vod'ika.""Boba hadn't thought about those times in years. Back when he'd actually had brothers. Before Buir had told him they weren't vode. But that scar...for the first time, he remembered the name of the one bro...clone, who'd always been there for him.""Kote,"" he breathed.

Chapter Text
Even with everything Rex and Skywalker had said, Cody wasn't prepared for the sight of Prime, much younger than he'd ever seen, walking toward him. Rex was following him, a bewildered look on his face. At least he seemed to have calmed down since they spoke earlier.Cody glanced around at everyone else in the area. Several of Rex's men were waiting nearby, and General Skywalker was descending from their ship. His eyes caught on another man he didn't recognize wearing Mandalorian armor. That must be Jaster Mereel, considering how nice the armor was. And standing next to him was...Cody's breath caught in his throat as he locked eyes with Boba. The boy immediately dropped his gaze, but it was like he'd been staring at Cody. And that made Cody wonder. Was it possible his vod'ika did remember him? Maybe his scar...Boba had been devastated when Cody had nearly lost his eye in a training accident. And it hadn't helped that Fox had told him Cody was dying. But maybe Cody had been wrong. Maybe Boba actually did remember him.""Obi-Wan, finally!"" Skywalker rushed over to them, looking a bit frantic. ""What do we do?""Kenobi sighed before turning to Prime's buir. ""Hello there. I am Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.""""Jaster Mereel."" The man nodded.""Good to meet you, Mand'alor."" Kenobi turned to Prime. ""And...I'm glad to see you alive, Fett."" He made a face. ""Sorry, that...probably wasn't what you wanted to hear.""""Right."" Prime looked uncomfortable.Kenobi then gestured to Cody. ""This is Commander Cody.""Cody just nodded, unsure of what to say. Prime stared back, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else, a mixture of nerves and excitement. And Cody still couldn't get over just how young he was.""So."" Kenobi glanced at Boba with a smile. ""Do you still have the object you used?""""Yeah."" Boba's eyes narrowed. ""What are you going to do with it?""""For now, I just want to see it.""""Are you going to try to send us back?"" Fett asked. Cody couldn't tell whether he liked the idea or not.""That depends."" Kenobi tilted his head. ""For now, we need to figure out what this artifact is and what it did.""Boba hesitated for a moment before huffing. ""Fine."" He turned. ""I'll go get it.""He disappeared into the ship and Cody exchanged a glance with Rex. This was all way too confusing. Jaster kept a close eye on Cody as Boba disappeared. Although he didn't think the boy had meant for him to hear, he was sure Boba whispered something when he'd seen the commander. Kote. Glory. It was very similar to the name Cody. Something told Jaster that wasn't coincidence.Only one way to find out.He strolled closer to Cody and Kenobi. ""Cody."" He smiled. ""Does that happen to come from the Mando'a kote?""Cody's eyes locked on his. ""Well...that was the inspiration.""""Really?"" Kenobi glanced at him. ""You never told me that.""Cody shrugged. ""Stopped using it a long time ago.""Boba came running out of the ship with the stone object in his hand. ""Here."" He thrust it at Kenobi, carefully avoiding Cody's gaze.Kenobi took the strange stone gingerly. ""Interesting."" He turned it over, examining it closely.""You recognize it?"" Jango walked over to their group.""No. But possibly some of the markings.""""What are we going to do?"" Skywalker asked.Kenobi continued to stare at the object for a moment. ""I believe this is a matter for the Council."" He glanced up. ""Would you three mind accompanying us to Coruscant?""Part of Jaster did mind. He didn't really want anything to do with the Republic or the Jedi. But perhaps it would be best to have the Jedi involved in this particular matter, despite his misgivings.""I suppose we can.""""Wonderful."" Kenobi smiled.""I'm not,"" Boba said.Jango cast Jaster a quick glance before grabbing the boy's shoulder. ""Boba, this is for the best. It won't be forever. We'll just talk with them.""Boba dropped his eyes, still looking stubborn. ""I'm not leaving your ship.""""Okay."" Kenobi nodded. ""You three can take it to Coruscant. However, I would like at least one from our party to accompany you. I hope you understand.""Jaster nodded. He understood perfectly. The jetii didn't want people from the past running all over the galaxy. He couldn't really say he blamed them.""General."" Cody stepped forward. ""I can go with them.""""And me,"" Rex added.Cody raised his eyebrows at his brother. Jaster was surprised as well, but pleased. Jango looked just as surprised, but Jaster could see the relief in his eyes. He was so proud of his ad'ika, trying to fix his mistake even if he wasn't the one who made it.""Very well."" Kenobi nodded. ""That's settled then.""""What!"" Boba glared at the clones. ""We don't need them.""For a moment, Jaster thought he caught a flash of hurt in Cody's eyes.""It's okay,"" Jaster said. ""Come on, let's get going.""Boba looked furious. For a moment, Jaster feared he was going to attack his own vode. Instead, he whirled and stalked into his ship with a huff. Jaster sighed and followed him, Jango and the two clones close behind. This was going to be an interesting trip. It wasn't long before they were settled on Fett's ship, flying toward Coruscant. Prime and Mereel had both been polite, almost overly so in Prime's case. That made Rex squirm. Still, he found Fett wasn't anything like what he'd expected. In fact, the more he was around the man, the more he found himself believing that this version might actually be different.After a little while, Cody managed to pull Rex to a semi-private corner so they could talk.""Su'cuy vod'ika."" Cody gave his shoulder a firm squeeze. ""How are you?""""Better than I thought I'd be.""""Prime's not what you expected?""Rex snorted. ""You can say that again."" He ran a hand over his face. ""I just don't know Cody. He...well...he seems to actually care. It's...strange. I'm not saying I trust him yet, not by a long shot. But...I actually think I want to."" He paused for a moment, considering his words. ""He said, if we wanted, he'd say the gai bal manda for all of us.""Cody's eyes widened. ""He'd adopt a couple million of us?""Rex shrugged. ""That's what he said. Although, he also seems nervous about the idea. Like he doesn't think he could do it.""They both grew quiet. Rex still was conflicted about the whole thing. Part of him still hated Prime. But he also couldn't believe that this man was the same one from Kamino, the one who'd been willing to let him die. This one might have actually fought to keep him alive, odd as that seemed.""Rex..."" Cody took a deep breath. ""There's something else I was hoping to talk with you about.""Rex nodded, waiting for his brother to speak.""I just...with Boba around..."" Cody shook his head. ""I don't want you to feel like, well...""Rex's eyes widened. ""Of course not!"" He grabbed Cody's shoulders. ""Cody, I know he was your vod'ika long before I was. Growing up, there were times I felt bad...like I might be replacing him. But I would never hold it against you for trying to get him back again.""Cody relaxed slightly. ""You sure?""""Yes."" Rex pulled away. ""I might be a little cold toward him, but not because I think you'd try to replace me. More because I'm angry for how much he hurt you before. But if you feel you need to do this, then I'll support you all the way.""A true smile broke across Cody's face. ""Thanks Rex. You really are an amazing vod'ika.""Rex smiled back and pulled Cody into a hug. ""Anytime ori'vod.""And he wasn't lying. If Cody was going to try to get his little brother back, then Rex would support him.However, if Boba did anything to hurt Cody again, the kid had better watch his back.

Chapter Text
Boba was alone in the cockpit, staring out at hyperspace and lost in his thoughts, when a voice startled him.""Hey Boba.""He didn't react for a moment even as his heart raced. Despite the voice being the same, he knew it wasn't his buir or the blond clone. And that left only one person, someone he really didn't want to talk with at the moment.""What do you want clone?"" he snapped, not bothering to turn around. Why should he? He was the son of Jango Fett, not some worthless copy.The clone didn't respond. The silence grated on Boba's nerves until he whirled around to tell the clone to get lost. But his eyes caught on the scar, and he soon found himself meeting the other's eyes. They were so, so sad. An uncomfortable feeling curled in Boba's stomach.They just stared at each other for a moment. Boba tried to think of something to say to just get the other to go away. But despite himself, he found he didn't want to say something to hurt him. He kept remembering when they were younger, when his buir was off-world and his ori'vod was there for him.Buir would be so disappointed in him.""What do you want?"" His voice wasn't as harsh this time, despite his best effort.The other searched his face for a moment before his lips turned up in a small smile. ""You do remember, don't you vod'ika?""Boba couldn't help but suck in a breath. He hadn't been called that in...But it was wrong.""I'm not your vod'ika."" He dropped his eyes. ""I never was.""""That's not true, and you know it.""Boba clenched his fists. He hated this. He hated that he wanted to be a vod'ika again. Hated that part of him wanted his ori'vod to gather him in his arms. Hated that this man probably knew him better than this version of Buir did.""I won't push you."" The other made no move. ""I just want you to know what I told you before is still true. I'll always be here for you vod'ika.""
But you weren't.
Boba blinked, surprised at the thought. But it was true. Where was he the last year, when Boba had been all alone? Serving the stupid jetii, the people who'd killed Buir.Another voice seemed to pop into his head. Still...you did abandon him first.Boba pushed that thought away. ""Whatever."" He whirled and sat down again.He heard a sigh as the other made to leave the cockpit, but then he paused. ""I know your buir pushed you away from us. But from what I've heard, this one won't. Just something to think about.""Then he was gone. Boba clenched his knees to his chest and found himself wanting to cry. Whether out of anger, loneliness, or fear, he couldn't tell. Jango was pacing, unsure of what else to do. So far, both Cody and Rex had stayed away from him as much as they could on such a small ship. But he'd been watching them nonetheless.He still didn't understand why, the first time, he'd treated his sons so badly. There was a fire in their eyes that clearly reflected his own. But he was also surprised by how gentle they were with each other. He'd already heard them call each other brothers. It sounded like they considered every clone their brother. But it was obvious these two were closer than that.Rex had relaxed considerably when Cody had arrived. And it hadn't taken long to realize Cody was trying to keep himself between Rex and Jango. That hurt, though he tried to tell himself Cody was protecting his vod'ika from a man who no longer existed. He just needed to give them time. At least, he hoped so.Still, on such a small ship, it was impossible not to run into someone eventually. They were almost at their destination when Jango found himself face-to-face with Cody. The other man froze for a moment before his face took on a neutral expression.""Sir."" He nodded.""Please don't call me that."" Jango grimaced.Cody's face took on a curious expression. ""Rex said you were different. Maybe he was right.""Jango smiled a little, hoping to put Cody at ease. ""You two are close, aren't you?""""We are."" Cody nodded.Jango stared at him for a moment before taking a deep breath. ""What did...the other me do to him?""Cody stiffened, eyes growing hard.""Please."" Jango sighed. ""What...he did to all of you was wrong. I'm just trying to make it right.""Cody regarded him for a moment with a suspicious expression. ""The Kaminoans wanted to decommission Rex for his defect. I asked you to stop them. You wouldn't even try."" His voice was cold.Jango swallowed. ""Decommission, meaning...""""Kill.""Jango dropped his eyes, shame flooding over him. ""I'm so sorry,"" he whispered.It took a moment for Cody to reply. When he did, his voice was a little softer. ""Another brother helped me save him.""""I'm glad."" Jango forced himself to meet Cody's eyes. ""He's mandokarla.""Cody smiled. ""That he is.""They grew quiet for a moment, regarding each other. Cody appeared physically a few years older than Jango was currently, and wasn't that a scary thought? The other man was observing him with hard eyes, searching his face. It took all of Jango's willpower not to drop his own eyes. Finally, Cody nodded a little as if he'd found what he was looking for.""I told Boba you wouldn't keep him away from us,"" he said.Jango's brow furrowed. ""Why would I do that? He needs his aliit."" He dipped his eyes at last. ""And I don't know if I can be what he needs me to be...not yet at least. He'll need his vode.""""Good."" Cody turned and walked away as they started making the decent toward Coruscant. ""I hope you tell him that.""Jango stared after him, confused. For the first time, he realized he knew nothing of Boba's relationships with the other clones. He'd just assumed they saw him as a little brother. That was true for Cody at least, from the tone of his voice. But something told him there was more to it than that.With everything that had happened, he hadn't really thought about Boba's reaction to his vode. He certainly didn't treat them as brothers. Instead, he was cold toward them, trying his best to not interact with them at all. But why? Unless...Cody's words placed the missing pieces together. Jango, the other Jango, had kept Boba from them. He supposed it made sense, in some twisted way. To that man, Boba had been his son while the others hadn't.He let out a long sigh and glanced up at the cockpit, where he knew Boba was. He was going to have to have a long talk with the boy. Rex was relieved they'd finally made it to Coruscant. The ship had landed and everyone was anxious to get off. He was about to follow Cody outside when he heard a shuffling from the cockpit and hesitated. He really was truthful when he told Cody he'd support his efforts to connect with Boba. Still, it wouldn't hurt to give the kid a warning.Everyone else was already off when Boba finally appeared. When he caught sight of Rex, his face quickly took on the cold glare that Rex was becoming so familiar with.""What?""Rex hesitated just a moment, considering his words. ""Don't do anything to hurt Cody. Not again.""Surprise flashed across Boba's face. That obviously wasn't what he'd expected to hear. But he soon caught himself and sneered at Rex.""Why? What would you do about it?""""I'll think of something.""Uncertainty flashed across Boba's face for just a second.""What do you mean, 'not again'? I never hurt him.""""Physically."" Rex crossed his arms. ""Don't mess with me kid. I saw the look on your face. You remember him. And he was heartbroken when you started ignoring him.""Boba opened his mouth for a moment before snapping it closed. He just glared at Rex for a moment after that.""Look."" Rex sighed. ""I don't personally have anything against you. I know it was Prime's fault that you abandoned your brothers.""""Not my brothers,"" Boba muttered.Rex rolled his eyes. ""But Cody's protected me since I was a cadet. And if you do anything to hurt my ori'vod again, you'll regret it.""Boba's eyes snapped to Rex's face at the word ori'vod, eyes becoming dangerous.""Whatever."" He shoved past Rex toward the door.Rex stared after him for a moment, confused. Something about Boba's tone seemed off. Almost like...was the kid jealous? Jealous that Rex had Cody for an ori'vod while he didn't feel he did anymore? Rex just couldn't tell.He sighed and followed the others outside. Despite all his misgivings, both about Boba and Prime, Rex dared let himself hope that things were about to get better. For all of them. And he truly did hope that Boba would give Cody the chance to be his ori'vod again. Rex felt no need for jealousy himself. Cody had enough love for both of them.

Chapter Text
Obi-Wan couldn't help but let out a deep sigh as he walked through the Temple's doors, time-travelers trailing behind him. It was good to be back. Everything had been so strange. He was glad the other masters would have a chance to look at the artifact. See if they couldn't figure out just what Boba Fett had done.But even with his relief at being home, there were some things bothering him.Jaster Mereel was alive. The Mand'alor was alive. And if they couldn't find a way to send him back, that fact was going to have drastic consequences for Mandalore, and possibly for the whole galaxy.While he couldn't say he agreed with all Satine's ideals, he wasn't sure if Jaster Mereel's would be better. They were stark opposites. Satine was against all fighting and war. Mereel was a warrior, through and through. Both extreme in their beliefs.However, Obi-Wan couldn't help but find himself wondering. If the Mand'alor stayed, and the two could find a way to work together...That was an interesting thought. A pretty far-fetched one, if he was being honest. However, they did have a common enemy. Death Watch was still very much active. Maybe, if he could get the two stubborn Mandalorians to find some common ground...But he was getting ahead of himself. For now, they needed to speak with the Jedi Council and figure out what was to be done about the time-travelling Mandalorians.""Here we are."" He opened a door. ""These will be your rooms for the entirety of your stay.""""Thank you."" Jaster nodded and walked into the apartment. Jango offered a slight smile before following his father, and Boba just stalked past without looking up.""If you need anything, don't hesitate to let us know."" Obi-Wan turned to where Anakin was waiting. ""We have to meet with the Jedi council.""Anakin quickly fell into step beside him as they walked down the hall. ""So."" Anakin glanced at him. ""What do you think is going to happen?""Obi-Wan sighed. He'd managed to evade all his former padawan's questions while on the ship. But now, it looked like Anakin was tired of waiting.""I don't know. Either the council will find a way to send them back, or they won't.""Anakin was quiet for a moment. ""Do you think they should?"" he asked in a quiet voice.Obi-Wan glanced at him in surprise. ""Well...we have no idea what the effects of time-travel could be.""Anakin shrugged. ""Everything seems okay so far.""""True."" Obi-wan blinked. ""But...why would you want them to stay?""""It's just..."" Anakin let out a long breath. ""I can understand why Boba wanted his father back. And now that he's here...it just seems cruel to take him away again.""Obi-Wan grew quiet at his words. He hadn't really thought about it like that, from Boba's point of view.""We'll have to wait and see what the council says,"" Obi-Wan said. ""For all we know, there's no way to send them back.""""Which could be good for Boba."" Anakin sighed. ""But will create a hundred more problems for us.""They continued in silence to the council chambers and waited to make their report to the council. ""Boba."" Jango sat next to his son. Son. He still couldn't quite wrap his mind around that idea. He had ade now. ""Can we talk?""""Sure!"" Boba grinned up at him. As soon as they were alone, just the three of them, the boy's demeanor had changed drastically. Even so, Jango could tell there was still something bothering the boy.""I was wondering,"" Jango said slowly. ""What exactly did...did I...the other me..."" He shook his head. ""What did he tell you about the clones?""Boba's face fell. ""I...well...""Jaster seemed to take interest in their conversation, a curious look on his face.Jango sighed. ""He told you to stay away from them, didn't he?""Boba stared at him for a moment before nodding.""Can you explain?""Boba crossed his arms. ""When I was little, I used to sneak away and spend some time with a batch of cadets. They...treated me like one of them."" He dropped his eyes. ""But...but Buir found out and got mad at them. He told me I was his son, I was special. They were just copies. And that they'd grow up a lot faster than me.""Jango felt his heart sink. ""So he told you they weren't your vode?""""They're not my vode!"" Boba shook his head. ""I'm more important than them. Don't you get it? They were made to die. I was made to be your son!""All was quiet for a moment as Jango tried to figure out what to say. Then Boba dropped his eyes.""Unless..."" He swallowed. ""You...you'd rather have them for sons than me.""""No!"" Jango grabbed Boba's arms. ""Why does it have to be one or the other? Can't I have all of you for my sons?""Boba's eyes shot up. ""But..."" He shook his head again. ""That's not what you taught me!""""The other me...Boba, I'm not him. Not yet anyway. I'll still be your buir if you'll let me. But you need your vode."" He smiled. ""They care for you. I could see it in their eyes. Especially Cody.""""No he doesn't!"" Boba snapped. ""Kote abandoned me! After he promised he'd be there for me!""Jango blinked, surprised at the Mando'a name. He was relieved when Jaster finally spoke up.""You blame them for not being there for you after your buir died.""Boba just sat there, an unreadable expression on his face.Jaster sighed. ""You may have a very good reason to feel that way. We don't know most of what's happened since our time.""Boba was quiet for a moment, expression a mixture of sadness and anger. ""The jetii Windu...cut off Buir's head."" He shook his head. ""It all happened so fast...the clones were there, then everyone was gone. And Buir's helmet...it was just sitting there.""Jango stared at Boba, heart breaking.""I was all alone."" Boba looked on the verge of tears. ""I didn't know what to do. The clones never looked for me."" He closed his eyes. ""Kote never looked for me...and he promised.""""Did you try going to them?"" Jaster asked.Boba hesitated a moment. ""No. Buir said...he said...""Jango sighed, not quite sure what to say. He felt like he was arguing with himself. It was obvious Boba was conflicted. Some part of him longed for his vode, that was obvious. But he didn't want to disappoint his father either.""Boba."" Jango grabbed his shoulders. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry he kept you away from them. But I won't.""Boba shook his head. ""Don't need them.""Jango smiled sadly. ""Yes, you do. You might just need them more than you need me.""Boba just stared at him for a moment, confusion in his eyes. ""Are...are you going to be their buir too?""""I hope so, if they'll let me."" He cocked his head. ""Does that bother you?""Boba blinked for a moment. ""Kote always told me I was lucky to have you for a buir. I...I think he wanted one too."" He shook his head. ""I didn't understand why you wouldn't be. But...after you explained...I don't know. I just never thought to question you."" He swallowed. ""That blond clone...he said I hurt Kote by staying away from him. I didn't realize that. I never wanted to hurt him, not really.""Jango sat back a little. ""That just goes to show how much he loves you. You might feel he abandoned you, but maybe he feels the same."" He paused for a moment. ""Tell me the truth Boba. Do you want Kote and the others to be your brothers? I won't be upset no matter what you say.""Boba just stared at him for a moment. He opened his mouth, then closed it again. It was a full minute before he finally spoke in a voice so low Jango had to strain to hear.""Elek Buir. I do."" Yoda listened intently as Kenobi and Skywalker gave their reports. Time travel. It was a strange thing for sure. But when you were hundreds of years old, things like that didn't surprise you as much as they used to.The two Jedi finished their reports and all grew silent.""This artifact,"" Yoda said. ""Bring it, have you?""""Yes Master."" Skywalker stepped forward and carefully placed a stone object wrapped in cloth before them.Yoda leaned forward, eyes catching on the strange patterns of lines and circles on the object. ""Hmm.""Obi-Wan glanced at him. ""You recognize it Master?""""Not the object."" Yoda pointed to the stone's markings. ""The symbols. Seen them before, I have.""""They do look familiar."" Master Koon leaned forward. ""Curving paths and circular doorways. I believe I have seen similar imagery within the Jedi temple on Lothal.""Yoda nodded. ""Pathways through time, they represent.""""So...what does that mean for us and the Mandalorians?"" Skywalker asked.""We'll have to see if we can use it to send them back to their own time,"" Master Mundi said.Yoda shook his head sadly. ""Possible, this is not.""A shocked silence followed his words.""But...how do you know?"" Obi-Wan asked.""Seen I have many years."" Yoda closed his eyes. ""The first time-travelers, these are not.""Mace nodded slowly. ""I remember the report. It was pretty vague, but several Twi'leks got pulled into the future. The Jedi could not find a way to get them back.""""But..."" Master Mundi shook his head. ""Won't it be a problem if they no longer exist in their own time? What we all felt when they first arrived...""""A resettling of time, it was,"" Yoda said.""Resettling?"" Obi-Wan asked.Yoda nodded. ""Allowing the Mandalorians to exist in our own time as well as in the past. Remain in tact, the past will. To change, impossible this is.""All grew quiet again as Yoda's words sank in.""The Mand'alor has returned,"" Obi-Wan muttered. ""That...is going to cause some significant changes for the planet.""Yoda's ears curled foreword. ""About to change, much is.""




Notes:

Hopefully my time-travel logic makes at least a little sense. I definitely wanted to draw from the idea of the World Between Worlds, but without using the temple on Lothal.I didn't really want to go too much into Mandalorian politics in this story, but I'm realizing I'm going to have to at least a little. I know a lot of people hate Satine and others love her. I personally don't particularly like or dislike her, so hopefully everybody can still enjoy this.On another note, I realized when writing this I haven't really tried to write Yoda's dialogue before. Hope it sounds okay.Mando'a Translations:Mand'alor: sole rulerAde: childrenBuir: fatherVode: brothersJetii: JediElek: yes

Chapter Text
Jaster could do nothing but stare at the Jedi Masters before him. Kenobi was there as well as a small green being called Yoda. Instead of calling them to the Council chamber, the masters had come to the Mandalorians' rooms. Hoping to soften the blow probably.But nothing could have prepared him for the news they brought.""So that's it."" Jaster took a breath, trying to steady himself. ""We're not going back.""""Sorry, we are."" Master Yoda's ears curled forward. ""But impossible to change, this is.""""But what about our home?"" Jango burst. ""They'll need Buir on Mandalore. Without him...""""We believe you're both still there as well,"" Kenobi said. ""From the moment you entered this time, you existed in two different times.""Jaster nodded slowly. ""I see."" Jango shot him with an incredulous look, as if he was wondering how Jaster was okay with this.""Thank you,"" Jaster said. ""We need to talk alone.""The Jedi Masters nodded and turned to go, but Kenobi paused at the door.""I really am sorry things worked out this way. Still, maybe this happened for a reason.""Jaster glanced over at Boba as the Jedi left. He had a strange look on his face, like he was trying not to be happy. He couldn't blame the boy. It was hard, losing a parent. Boba would have been heartbroken if Jango was taken away from him again. But something told him Boba also felt a little guilty now for what he'd unintentionally done.Then Jaster turned to his ad. ""Jango?"" He placed a hand on his shoulder. ""Are you okay?""Jango had a contemplative look on his face as he stared past Jaster. The fear that had been there moments before had been replaced by something else. Finally, he met Jaster's eyes.""Maybe he's right.""""Who?""""Kenobi."" Jango nodded a little. ""Maybe we're here for a reason. We don't know much about our world in this time, but it sounds like they need their Mand'alor back."" His eyes drifted to Boba. ""And I have several million ade in need of a buir.""""And a ba'buir,"" Boba added.Jaster glanced at him, a little surprised. Boba really seemed to be warming to the idea of accepting the clones as his vode, maybe even be getting excited about it.Boba got up and walked over to them. ""I never meant for this to happen, you know. But..."" He glanced up at both of them, longing clear in his eyes. ""I can't be sorry about it.""Jaster stared at him for a moment before smiling. ""You're both right."" He pulled both Boba and Jango into a hug. ""If we're stuck here, we may as well make the most of it. Help our people and our aliit.""Jango nodded. ""How will we go about both those goals?""""I think we need to start by getting our aliit together.""""Millions of them?"" Boba rolled his eyes. ""Easier said than done.""""We start with small steps."" He ran his fingers over Boba's curls. ""You wanted to talk to Kote, right?""Boba's smile dropped a little. ""I...I don't know what to say to him. I haven't treated any clones right in years."" He grimaced. ""It still feels...strange. To think of them as...as vode."" His eyes darted to Jango as if afraid he'd get mad.""Just talk to him. Be yourself"" Jango smiled. ""I'm sure he'll be thrilled.""Boba was quiet for a moment before nodding. ""Okay."" For the first time in longer than he could remember, Boba was happy. Really, really happy. He felt guilty about stealing Buir and Ba'buir out of their own time, but at least he wasn't alone anymore!And Buir wanted him to have vode. Boba hadn't expected that. But at the same time, now that they were approaching the clone barracks, he felt his heart racing in excitement at the thought of seeing Kote again. Sure, he'd just seen him earlier that day. But now he had permission from Buir. He just hoped that Kote didn't hate him now. Maybe he'd get to see the others too, Kote's batchmates. None of them had names when he'd stopped sneaking away to visit them. They probably did now.And they'd all be older than him, just like Kote. That thought slowed his steps. For a moment, he'd been thinking of the boy back on Kamino, only a few years older than him. The one with an easy smile and the best hugs. Not a fully grown clone trooper, a hardened warrior. Why would he want Boba around? Grown-ups were always telling him he was getting in the way.Still, Kote had sought him out earlier. So maybe...He paused as they reached the barracks, nerves getting worse.""Come on Boba."" Buir placed a hand on his shoulder. ""Everything will be okay.""Boba hoped so. He wasn't even sure they'd be welcome within the barracks. But Kenobi had told them how to get there and said it wouldn't be a problem.So, finally, Boba walked in. It felt a little like being back on Kamino. There were clones everywhere. Only difference was there were no cadets. Eyes quickly turned to them and mutters reached his ears as they walked down a hallway. It was only a moment before someone called out to them.""Prime!"" One of the clones from before ran over to them, the one with the five.Buir smiled. ""Hello Fives.""Fives grinned. ""You have to come meet some of the others! They wouldn't believe us when we told them about you.""Buir nodded. ""I'd love to meet more of your vode.""""So would I,"" Jaster said.Fives glanced down at Boba. ""How about you vod'ika?""Boba blinked for a moment, shocked. No one but Kote and his batch had ever called him that.""Um...actually..."" Boba searched for words. ""I...I was hoping to talk to...to Commander Cody. Can you tell me where to find him?""Fives' eyes widened a little, but he didn't question Boba's request. ""Probably in his quarters."" He gestured down a hall. ""Down there, first left, second door on the right.""""Thanks."" Boba offered a small smile.Buir squeezed his shoulder before following Fives. ""Good luck ad'ika.""""You too.""Then he turned and hurried down the hall, following Fives' instructions. All too soon, he found himself standing in front of a closed door. Actually knocking was a lot harder than it should have been. Finally, after a couple minutes, he did.But when the door opened, it wasn't Kote. ""It's about time you got here Fox!"" The clone cut off abruptly.Boba felt himself wilt under the other man's scrutiny. He had a scar and a cybernetic eye, and his face was hard. He stared down at Boba for a moment in shock before his face softened.""Vod'ika,"" he whispered. ""Cody said...but I didn't believe..."" He shook his head.Boba was ready to run at the strange reaction, but the clone was quickly pulled back from behind.""Wolffe, you're going to scare him off!""And there was Kote. He glanced down at Boba with a hopeful smile.""Hey vod'ika."" He stepped aside. ""Come on in. Didn't know you were coming, but this will work well. Almost everyone's here.""""Everyone?"" Boba tentatively stepped in, but froze when he saw the other two clones in the room, one of whom was Rex. The blond clone was watching him carefully, but Boba couldn't read his expression. Still, he hadn't forgotten the threat from before. And he hadn't forgotten the sharp pang of jealousy he'd felt when Rex had called Kote his ori'vod.""I don't believe it,"" the other clone muttered.Footsteps ran up from behind, where the door was still open, and Boba turned in time to see another clone enter.""Sorry I'm late. I—""He froze when he caught sight of Boba. But his expression quickly turned angry.""What are you doing here?"" He snapped. ""I thought you were too good for us now or something!""""Fox!"" Kote snapped.""What?"" Fox glared at him. ""He doesn't have any right to be part of this batch anymore! Brothers don't abandon each other.""""What?"" Boba blinked, realization coming over him. He took a couple steps toward Fox, noticing a small scar on his chin. ""Wait...'10?""Fox's eyes snapped back toward him, but the anger had faded into sadness. Boba shook his head and glanced at the other two. ""Are...are you...""""Yeah vod'ika, it's us. I'm Ponds."" Ponds offered a smile and gestured to the clone with the cybernetic eye. ""That's Wolffe.""Boba just blinked, staring at all of them. He'd kept telling himself this would happen. They were all grown up now. That was part of why Buir kept him away from them. But still...seeing them like this.""Breathe vod'ika."" Kote squeezed his shoulder. ""It's alright. We're all here. We're together again.""Boba shook his head. ""You...you're all...""He didn't know what to do. They were all going to just...accept him? Like they had the first time? Why?""But...but..."" He shook his head. ""I...I thought you'd be angry with me.""""Who says we aren't?"" Fox huffed. But there was no heat in his words.""It was Prime who kept you away. We knew that,"" Ponds said.Boba clenched his fists, voice dropping to a whisper. ""Then why didn't you look for me?""Shocked expressions set upon all their faces.""Boba."" Kote's arms were encircling him, so much bigger and stronger than before. So much more like Buir's, and yet completely different. ""I...have no excuse. I told myself you wouldn't want to be found, but..."" He squeezed Boba tighter. ""I'm sorry vod'ika. Everything just got so crazy and...""""You forgot about me.""""No!"" Kote kneeled in front of him. ""Never. I thought about you often, wondered if you were okay. But I had no idea how to find you. I'm sorry. I should have tried. We never leave batch behind.""Boba shook his head. ""I don't have a batch.""He heard a rumbling laugh and glanced back at Wolffe. ""Yeah kid, you do.""""Wh-what?""""It's true."" Fox nodded. ""Alpha-17 told us.""""You were the fifth member of our batch,"" Ponds said, ""but...""Kote sighed. ""The Kaminoans took you away for Prime, almost as soon as we were out of our tubes.""Boba blinked, unsure of what to do with that information. He'd always thought he'd been grown alone. Wasn't that what Buir meant when he said Boba was special? Had Buir known he'd had a batch? That he really was no different from any other clone other than the fact Buir wanted him?""Besides, Aliit ori'shya tal'din,"" Wolffe said. ""Rex may be younger than us, but he's part of our batch too.""Boba felt a spike of anger. It sounded like a kind way of saying Rex was his replacement. But when he glanced at the blond clone to glare at him, he was shocked by the happy smile on his face, all trepidation from before gone. He got up and walked over to them.""Cody and the others saved me from decommissioning.""""And then we couldn't get rid of him."" Fox smirked. ""Our troublesome CT. Cody's shadow.""Rex rolled his eyes and glanced back at Boba. ""Listen, I'm...sorry for what I said before.""Kote shot him a sharp glare. ""What did you say?""""It's nothing,"" Boba found himself saying. ""I...understand.""Rex's eyes sparkled. ""They always told me stories about you. Now...I'm glad I finally get to meet you ori'vod.""Boba's eyes widened in realization. Of course. As strange as it seemed, Boba was older than the man in front of him.Finally, he managed a tentative smile. ""So...can all of us be vode again?""""Vod'ika."" Kote scooped him up from behind, and Boba found he didn't care. ""We never stopped being vode.""Then his whole batch was squishing him in a hug. Boba didn't think he'd ever been so happy. He had both his buir and vode back. He was home.




Notes:

I was really trying to draw out the reunion between Boba and his batchmates, but it seems I have little patience and couldn't wait any longer.

Chapter Text
Jango couldn't help but stare at all the clones they passed. It had been weird enough with a handful of men sharing his face. But now, everywhere he looked, his own face stared back. Some very interesting variations of his face, he had to admit. Different tattoos, hairstyles, eye or hair color, and scars marked each man as a unique individual. And each set of armor was painted in distinct colors.Jaster placed a hand on his shoulder. ""Breathe ad'ika,"" he said in a low voice so as not to be overheard. ""Everything's going to be fine now.""""But there's so many."" Jango swallowed. ""I...don't know how to be a buir for one ad, and this..."" He shook his head.""I know. But you don't have to do this alone. I'm here for you."" Jaster smiled and Jango found his nerves calming. Buir was right. Between the two of them, they'd figure out what to do.""Come on."" Fives ushered them into a large rec room where many clones were relaxing.""Hey, Fives, where'd you find the Mandos?"" someone asked. ""Better question,"" another said, ""is why does a vod have Mandalorian armor?""Jango stiffened, suddenly wishing he'd worn his helmet.""Woah, nice vod! Are we getting an upgrade or something?""""Is that real beskar? That's got to be better than plastoid.""""Hey! I like my armor.""""Wait a minute."" A gray-armored clone groaned and glanced at Fives. ""Please tell me you weren't telling the truth and this is some past version of Prime.""""Sure is Boost!"" Fives pulled Jango forward as a hush fell over the room. ""Vode, I know this is going to sound strange, but this is Jango Fett. The Prime. He's from the past.""Jango felt his cheeks burn as all the clones stared at him in shock.""You actually were telling the truth,"" one of the gold-armored clones muttered.Other mutters filled the air. Jango stepped back on instinct, wishing his buir would do something.""Aren't you too young to be Prime?"" He glanced over at a gold-armored clone who looked to be physically the same age Jango was.""I...I...""""He's from the past di'kut!"" Another clone shoved the other's shoulder. ""Of course he'd be younger.""The shocked silence had evaporated to be replaced with a cacophony of questions.""You're really Prime?""""Why are you here? How are you here?""""I...I thought you didn't like us.""""Hey, give him some space."" Echo got in front of him and some of the clones backed off.Jango was grateful for Echo's intervention, but he was also stuck on the last comment he'd heard. I thought you didn't like us. He'd seen the trooper who said it and focused on him. The young man wilted under his gaze and began to pull back so his vode were shielding him.""Hey, no, it's okay."" Jango reached out and the trooper froze, fear in his eyes. It struck Jango at that moment just how young he was. Physically, at least two or three years younger than Jango. And with their accelerated aging...he really didn't want to think about how old the kid really was.""Easy ad'ika."" Jango smiled. ""I'm not going to hurt you. Udesii.""The boy hesitated and took a tentative step forward. ""What's...what's that mean?""Jango's brow furrowed before he realized. ""Udesii. Calm down."" He frowned. ""I'm sorry. I thought you and your brothers could speak Mando'a.""""Only the Alphas, Nulls and Commandos were taught by some trainers,"" an older clone said. ""They passed some on to us. But younger vode don't know as much as the older ones do.""Jango nodded and turned back to the young clone. ""What's your name? Not your number, you're actual name.""The boy blinked at him. ""I'm...Skip. Sir!"" he added quickly.Jango sighed. ""You don't need to call me that. I'm just Jango.""Skip nodded quickly, sweat on his brow.""And you're right Skip. From what I'm told, the other version of me didn't care for any of you."" He grabbed Skip's shoulders and looked him dead in the eye. ""But I am not him.""""But..."" Skip swallowed. ""You're Prime, right?""""No,"" Jango said firmly. ""I'm not Prime. I'm Jango Fett. I never agreed to have myself cloned. And I..."" He took a deep breath and turned to face the other clones. ""I can't imagine why he mistreated you all the way he did. Because I can't imagine ever doing something like that.""A few clones muttered to each other. Others were staring at him, soaking in every word.Jango gestured Jaster forward. ""This is my buir, Jaster Mereel.""Jaster smiled. ""Your ba'buir.""""Wait."" Echo cocked his head. ""Doesn't that mean grandfather?""""Of course."" Jaster nodded.Skip glanced back at Jango. ""Does that mean...""Jango swallowed, feeling the eyes of every clone on him. ""It's a little more complicated than that.""Another clone snorted. ""Don't know why you'd think he'd want to be our buir.""""I do!"" Jango glanced around at the gathered clones. ""I do want to be your buir. All of you. But..."" He shook his head. ""I...just don't know if I can be what you need. Not yet anyway. It's not because of you, any of you. It's me. You all deserve a buir, but I can't help but think there's others in this galaxy who could take care of you far better than I can.""All was quiet for a few moments as the clones contemplated his words. Skip had dropped his eyes, but tentatively glanced back up at Jango.""But...what if we want you for a buir?""Jango stared at the kid. ""You don't know me.""""But you actually care for us,"" Fives said. ""Isn't that what a buir does?""Jango could only stare in shock. They...wanted him to be their buir? That wasn't what he'd expected, especially after Rex's initial reaction to Jango. But these boys were all staring at him with awe and hope. Didn't they expect Jango would let them down as a buir? He certainly did.""We have a lot to figure out still,"" Jaster said. ""For now, we need to figure out how to get you all rights as Mandalorian citizens.""""What?"" someone asked. ""You mean we'd actually be...people?""""You are people!"" Jango snapped. ""And I'll gladly take care of any demagolka who says otherwise.""""What's that mean?"" Skip seemed to have lost all his trepidation and was staring at Jango hopefully.""Demagolka. A horrible person, real-life monster."" Jango smiled at Skip. ""How 'bout I teach you a little more Mando'a?""Skip beamed at him and nodded. Rex really had wanted to believe that Boba wanted his brothers back. But it wasn't until Boba was standing amongst them on the verge of tears that he could truly believe the boy wasn't going to hurt Cody again. No, they'd both been hurting. And now it was finally time to heal.He was also now certain that Boba had been jealous of him. And he could understand why. There had been many times growing up he'd almost felt like a replacement for the command batch's missing member. He'd even voiced his concerns to Cody once. But Cody had been quick to assure him that Rex could never replace Boba, just as Boba could never replace Rex.So, Rex still found himself without any jealousy in the slightest as his ori'vode fawned over Boba. They all just looked so happy, laughing as Fox swung Boba around the room.Cody came and took a seat next to Rex, watching the scene with a happy smile. ""You talked to him, huh.""Rex shrugged. ""I just told him not to hurt you again.""Cody shook his head with an exhasperated smile.""What?"" Rex grinned. ""You know this is your fault, right? Your overprotectiveness rubbed off on me.""Cody laughed. ""Yeah...I guess you're right.""Suddenly, Rex found himself with an armful of vod'ika as Boba threw himself in Rex's lap. ""Save me!"" he shrieked, shifting so he was squished between Rex and Cody.""You're not getting away that easy."" Ponds grabbed Boba by the ankles and began dragging him back with a delighted smile.""Hey!"" Rex gently yanked Boba back and pulled the boy into his lap. ""No stealing him. I get a turn.""Boba groaned dramatically, but didn't try to escape from Rex's grasp. It was still hard to believe that Rex was younger than the boy. What would it be like, to have a normal childhood? Most clones would never know. Boba was the one exception. And even his childhood had been stolen away when his father had been killed.But while Rex called him ori'vod, he was already coming to think of Boba as a vod'ika. He was a lot smaller than the last little brothers Rex had taken under his wing. Echo and Fives may have been young and inexperienced, but at least he couldn't hold them in his lap. In fact, Rex had never really interacted with children before, even brothers. He'd been glad when Fives had taken charge of the cadets they'd helped during the attack on Kamino. Rex wouldn't have known what to say.Well, it looked like that was all about to change.Boba started squirming and Rex allowed him to sit up, sliding between him and Cody. The others had all sat down, looking more content and relaxed than Rex had seen in a while.""So."" Wolffe leaned forward. ""We hear your buir's a little different now.""Boba nodded. ""He's...well, he's still Buir. But he's very different."" He frowned. ""I...probably would never have come to you if he hadn't encouraged me so much. Said I needed my vode.""""You should hear him."" Cody shook his head. ""Acts almost like we're his sons.""""I think he intends to adopt you all eventually,"" Boba said. ""And if he doesn't, I bet Ba'buir will.""""I find that hard to believe."" Wolffe muttered.Ponds frowned. ""They'd have to stick around for that Boba. And...well, I'm sorry to say, but that isn't likely.""""But it is!"" Boba grinned. ""The jetiise said it's impossible to send them back, so they're here to stay!""Everyone grew quiet at that. Rex wasn't quite sure what to think. When Fett had talked about adopting them before, Rex had been shocked, but still assumed there wasn't really a chance for it to happen. He hadn't considered that the Jedi wouldn't be able to send them back.""That's...not what I expected,"" Fox said.""They went to talk to some of the others,"" Boba said. ""They went with one of the clones from earlier. Fives, I think.""Rex sighed. ""Of course.""""Come on."" Cody got up. ""We'd better go see what they're up to.""""Good!"" Boba got to his feet. ""Then you can all see Buir's not bad.""Rex felt a little uneasy, but truly hoped his new vod was right as they left to find the others.

Chapter Text
Cody didn't know what he'd expected to find when they arrived, but it was not Prime...no, Fett, not Prime...and his buir teaching Mando'a to several troopers. One shiny in particular was staring at Fett with wide eyes, soaking in every word. Everyone was listening carefully. Even if some in the room had learned some Mando'a, few knew much and none were fluent. But the lesson came to an abrupt halt when Boba ran to Fett and jumped in his arms.Fett smiled. ""Su'cuy ad'ika. Everything good?""""Elek."" Boba grinned, seemingly unable to contain his excitement. ""Kote and the others are my batchmates! No one told me.""""Wait, really?"" Waxer glanced at Cody. ""I didn't realize that, sir.""""We didn't really talk about it."" Cody smiled at his vod'ika. ""But we have him back now.""""Good."" Rex smirked. ""I'm not stuck being the ik'aad anymore.""""Hey!"" Boba protested. ""I'm not an ik'aad!""Rex chuckled. ""I know, ori'vod.""""Ori'vod?"" Fives stared at Rex. ""But...Captain, he's like ten!""""Eleven!"" Boba glared at Fives.""Yeah, well, I'm only ten,"" Rex said. ""You know he didn't get accelerated aging.""Fives blinked, glancing back at Boba. ""I'm not calling you ori'vod.""Boba shrugged. ""Feels a little weird anyway.""""Sorry, I can stop if you'd like."" Rex suddenly looked nervous.""Well, he's still my vod'ika."" Cody glanced at Boba. ""Maybe you could be, I don't know, everyone's...ori'vod'ika?""Boba cocked his head for a moment before laughing. ""Okay. I like it.""""Still can't believe he's older than us,"" Sinker muttered.The shiny sitting close to Fett glanced back up at him. ""Can we keep going with the Mando'a?""""Sure Skip."" Fett smiled. ""Let's see, what else can I teach you?""But Cody was distracted at that moment when Jaster Mereel walked purposefully toward him. ""It appears things are working out for your aliit.""""Yes."" Cody glanced at Fett. ""It sure seems like it.""Mereel nodded. ""Jango wants Boba to be happy. We both felt he needed his vode.""Cody let his gaze settle on Mereel. ""We heard you two are stuck here for a while,"" he said carefully. ""Do you have a plan?""Mereel sighed. ""Not exactly. I need to see about returning to Mandalore and finding any remaining haat Mando'ade. But it sounds like there aren't many left between Kyr'tsad and these New Mandalorians.""""General Kenobi might be able to help,"" Cody said. ""He's familiar with Mandalore and is...acquainted with the leader of the New Mandalorians, Duchess Kryze."" He honestly didn't know what was going on between his general and the duchess these days. And he didn't know how Kenobi would feel about helping the Mand'alor. He certainly cared for Kryze, but he also didn't believe in her ideals.""I'll have to find him, thank you."" Mereel paused for a moment. ""There's something else I wanted to talk to you about.""Cody nodded.""Jango really cares for all of you, and I know he wants to be your buir. However, he doesn't feel he could do the job well. Not to mention suddenly adopting so many would be...daunting, to say the least.""Cody snorted. ""I can imagine. I have a hard enough time watching over all the vod'ike under my command."" He frowned then. ""But...he actually wants to be our buir?""""He does."" Mereel nodded. ""I won't go spouting that he truly loves you and every one of your brothers. That's impossible. He hardly knows you and hasn't even met a majority of his ade. But I do believe he could come to love you and be a wonderful buir.""Cody blinked. ""I'm sorry, but where exactly are you going with all this?""""Well, what I want to propose is this."" Mereel crossed his arms. ""Jango will adopt some of the clones, as many as he's comfortable with, and I will adopt any that are left, making sure to keep close brothers together. It isn't ideal, as neither of us will have had time to actually get to know our ade. But, it would allow all of you to be part of my House as well as Mandalorian citizens.""Cody stared at him for a moment. They were going to adopt them, like, now? Even with all the talk, it had never really seemed real.""Well."" Mereel smiled. ""What do you think?"" Jaster was amused by the series of emotions that quickly crossed Cody's face. Confusion, shock, a brief hint of excitement, then carefully covered by an indifferent expression.""I...see.""Jaster chuckled. ""I know it's a lot to think about, but I really think it will do you and your brothers good.""Cody blinked. ""Why both of you? Why not one or the other?""""I would be more than happy to adopt all of you. But Jango needs this as well. It is still a big undertaking, but it might ease his mind if I take some of your brothers as my own ade."" Cody's brow wrinkled and Jaster sighed. ""Alright, it's not just for Jango. I want some of you to be my ade.""Cody's lips quirked as if he was trying not to laugh. ""And...and you or Fett would be our buir?""""Officially, yes."" Jaster smiled. ""It would take time to form a real relationship, of course. And, realistically, it is probably impossible for either of us to get to know most of you well. But, overall, it would be helpful for all of you. And, well, I for one would get to know as many of your vode as possible. Be the best buir I can. And I'm certain Jango will feel the same.""Cody stared at him for a few moments. Jaster could tell he was thinking hard. And, to be fair, it was a lot to take in. Jaster hadn't exactly meant to just dump it on Cody, but he seemed to be someone the others looked up to, and a natural leader.""You don't have to answer now,"" Jaster said. ""Take some time and talk it over with your brothers.""Cody seemed to be startled from his thoughts, blinking several times before bowing his head. ""Vor entye Mand'alor.""Jaster shook his head. ""N'entye. No debt son. We're all aliit."" He nodded toward the others. ""Go spend some time with your brothers. I'll see about talking with Kenobi.""Cody watched him a moment longer before nodding and going to Rex's side. Jaster watched fondly as Jango interacted with the boys. He'd relaxed a lot, but was still on edge. Hopefully not for much longer. Maybe he'd have to see about getting Jango to Kamino. He'd overheard some of the clones talking about all the cadets on the planet. More ade Boba's age might help soften Jango up.He felt a little guilty as he slipped out of the room, but he didn't worry too much. It would probably be good for Jango to be on his own with the clones for a while. He'd been relying on Jaster a lot. Hopefully he wouldn't be too angry with him though.Jaster made his way back to the Jedi temple and asked the first Jedi he saw where to find Kenobi. He was directed to a training room where he found both Kenobi and Skywalker dueling with their lightsabers.It had been some time since he'd seen a jetii in action. And while he didn't think much of their kind, he couldn't help but be impressed with their combat skills. After several moments, Kenobi noticed him watching and signaled Skywalker to stop.""Hello again."" Kenobi smiled. ""How did things go at the barracks?""""Very well, actually,"" Jaster said. ""Everyone will need some time, but I'm sure we'll get there.""Skywalker cleared his throat. ""I'm going to go check on Ahsoka. She should be finishing with her studies.""Kenobi sighed as Skywalker left. ""He's a little uncomfortable with the situation.""""Aren't we all."" Jaster chuckled. ""Anyway, if you're not too busy, I was hoping we could talk.""""Of course."" Kenobi raised a hand and they began walking through the Temple. ""I'm sure you still have many questions.""""I do."" Jaster nodded. ""Specifically, about Mandalore. Cody suggested I talk with you.""""Ah."" Kenobi frowned. ""Yes, I suppose that would be logical.""""He also said you are familiar with the duchess. What do you know about her?""""Well, Satine had a difficult time early in her life. She turned against all violence and became extremely pacifist.""Jaster clenched his teeth. ""That is not the way of our people.""Kenobi shrugged. ""It is something the two of us could never agree on.""Jaster raised an eyebrow. ""It sounds as if you know her pretty well.""Kenobi sighed. ""I protected her, back when I was a padawan. We grew quite close.""Jaster was curious, but could tell Kenobi didn't want to go into the topic. ""How do you think she'd react to me?""""That depends.""""On what?""Kenobi stopped and turned to face him fully. ""On just what you plan to do now that you're here. Are you going to claim the title of Mand'alor and take control of the planet by force? Or are you willing to attempt to find a compromise and work with Satine and her government?""Jaster tilted his head, regarding Kenobi steadily. ""I haven't decided yet.""Kenobi continued walking. ""Well, you and Satine share one thing in common.""""And what's that?""""Death Watch."" Jaster stiffened a little. ""Satine and her government have been working tirelessly to apprehend Pre Vizsla and his followers. They've become a strong terrorist threat on Mandalore.""Great. Another Vizsla.""And what exactly do they intend to do about them?"" Jaster asked. ""Politely request that they stop what they're doing and turn themselves in?""Kenobi sighed. ""I don't think Satine is quite sure what to do at this point. That's why it could prove to be so beneficial for you two to work together.""Jaster wasn't sure what he thought of that plan. ""And how do you think she would react to such an idea?""Kenobi stroked his beard for a moment before answering. ""Satine has gotten frustrated recently in her lack of progress when it comes to Death Watch. She might at least be open to negotiation.""Jaster nodded. ""And how do you think she and her government will react when they find out I intend to make several million soldiers Mandalorian citizens?""Kenobi froze and stared at Jaster. He was pleased to see he'd surprised the Jedi.""The clones,"" Kenobi said slowly. ""You're going to adopt them?""""As long as they agree to it, then I intend to have every one of them formally adopted by either Jango or myself.""""They're good men,"" Kenobi said slowly.""Boys,"" Jaster corrected. ""I don't care what they look like, those lads are just kids.""Kenobi stared at him for a moment before sighing. ""Maybe.""""So,"" Jaster pressed. ""What is the duchess's view on my grandsons? Does she care that millions of Mandalorians are being forced to fight for the Republic, something that goes against all her pacifist ways?""""Unfortunately, none on Mandalore view the clones as Mandalorians. I haven't personally discussed the matter with Satine, so I can't be sure what her opinion is."" Kenobi sighed. ""I for one completely support your efforts to make the clones Mandalorian citizens. I don't think Satine would be...pleased by the idea. And she can be very stubborn about these things.""Jaster nodded. ""It sounds as if my taking over Mandalore might be the only way to save my family then.""""I truly hope it doesn't come to that."" Kenobi frowned. ""Of course, there would be many more repercussions of these actions.""""As in the Republic would lose its army.""""Indeed."" Kenobi grew quiet for a moment. ""This war is slowly destroying both the Republic and the Jedi. We have thrown away so many of the ideals we once held so dear. But at the same time, I don't think anything good would come of the Separatists winning the war.""Jaster cocked his head. ""I won't pretend to know anything about the politics behind your war. All I want is to free my grandsons. I don't really care how that happens.""Kenobi was quiet again. They walked for several minutes before he sighed and turned to face Jaster again.""I will certainly help get you a meeting with Satine. And I will come along and see if I can't...ah...break the tension.""""You're that sure there'll be trouble?""""As I said, Satine is stubborn. And from what I've seen, you are too.""Jaster just shrugged.""If I am being completely honest, I doubt the meeting will go very well. Even so, I am hopeful that you two will eventually be able to find a compromise that will be mutually beneficial.""""Wishful thinking, Kenobi.""""Maybe."" Kenobi started walking again. ""But I have to hope. If you do succeed in getting the clones rights as Mandalorian citizens, it might finally bring an end to this war. The Republic losing its army would force the Senate to negotiate with the Separatists.""""I thought you were worried about the Separatists.""""I am."" Kenobi suddenly looked thoughtful. ""But...I don't know. I can't fight the feeling that only good can come from this.""Jaster raised an eyebrow. ""Ah yes, your Force is speaking to you again.""""Partially."" Kenobi glanced at him. ""It screamed at me the moment you arrived, and hasn't quieted since. But it's more than that. There are things about this war that just...haven't added up. The order for the clones themselves, for one thing."" He shook his head. ""Things need to change. And, so far, this is the best option I've seen.""Jaster stared at him for a moment before smiling. ""Well then, it sounds like we have work to do.""""Indeed."" Kenobi nodded. ""I'll see about getting you a meeting with Satine.""




Notes:

I want to remind everyone that I'm not well versed in Mandalorian politics and most of what I know comes from fanfiction, so I might get some things wrong. I'm going to do my best to be accurate, but that is also not going to be the main focus of this story. This is mostly going to focus on Jango and the clones, and any politics that come up will probably have something to do with the clones becoming Mandalorian citizens or something along those lines.Thank you all for your continued support of this story!Mando'a Translations:Buir: fatherSu'cuy: hiAd'ika: little oneElek: yesVod'ika: little brotherIk'aad: babyOri'vod: big brotherOri'vod'ika: big little brother (non-canon)Aliit: familyVode: brothersHaat Mando'ade: true MandaloriansKyr'tsad: Death WatchMand'alor: sole rulerVod'ike: little brothersAde: childrenVor entye: thank you (lit.

Chapter Text
Jango was enjoying himself more than he thought possible. The clones were all terribly bright and inquisitive, taking to Mando'a almost quicker than he could teach it. Especially the younger ones like Skip. He made sure to teach them not only the language, but the meaning behind the words. How important the adoption vow was, how they had to say daily remembrances for those who'd passed on. They all already knew about remembrances, even the youngest of them. It was sad how long a list they already had at such a young age.""What's Mandalore like?"" Skip asked after a while.""It's..."" Jango floundered for a moment, unsure how exactly to describe the world in a way that did it justice. He instinctively glanced around for his buir, but found no face but his own in the room. Where had Buir gone? Had he just left him? But...why? Jango needed him. He couldn't do this on his own.""He went to talk to General Kenobi."" Jango glanced over to see Cody watching him. ""Your buir. Shouldn't be gone long.""""Right...thanks."" Jango felt weird all of a sudden. Cody was basically his son, yet he acted far more mature than Jango felt and was able to read him like a book.""Um...sir?"" Jango jumped and glanced back at Skip. ""I...I'm sorry sir."" Skip's happy face had fallen. ""I didn't mean to...you don't have to tell me about it. I'm sorry.""Jango blinked, finally remembering the question the kid had asked. ""No...no, it's okay Skip. I was just surprised to see Buir was gone."" He frowned. ""And there's nothing to apologize for. You have every right to ask any questions you want. I won't get mad.""A small smile returned to Skip's face. ""Okay. Thank you sir.""""I really wish you'd just call me Jango. Or...Fett, I guess, if that makes you feel better.""Skip didn't look too happy about that, but nodded. ""Okay...Fett.""That felt weird too, but it was at least a start. ""Um...Mandalore. I just don't quite know how to describe it."" He smiled. ""You'll have to wait until you see it.""""I've never been there,"" Boba murmured from his spot at Jango's side. ""Buir said he'd take me when I was older, but...""""Don't worry. You'll see it one day."" Jango ran a hand over Boba's hair.He caught movement out of the corner of his eye and glanced up to see Cody motioning his batchmates to follow him.""Kote?"" Boba called.Cody smiled. ""Sorry vod'ika. There's still a war going. And we have to...talk.""Jango sighed and glanced back to the remaining clones as the commanders and captain left the room. Their numbers had dwindled considerably, some muttering about scheduled training or needing food or sleep. Skip was still there as well as another around his age in unpainted armor. Several of the blue-armored 501st troopers were there too, as well as a few with gold or gray armor.""So."" Jango smiled. ""I've told you about me, what about you?""Jesse shrugged. ""What about us? There's not much to tell.""""Oh, I doubt that,"" Jango said. ""For example, you all call each other brothers, yet it's obvious some of you are closer than others.""""That's for sure."" Fives slung an arm around Echo's shoulders. ""In general, batchmates are closest since we basically did everything together, growing up on Kamino. But there are also many brothers just as close who aren't batchmates.""""Are batchmates able to stay together?""Echo sighed. ""No. They often get split up. And it's almost unheard of for every member of a batch to survive long.""""Especially when they get sent out so young."" Kix's eyes darted to the two troopers with unpainted armor and Jango felt his heart drop. That did make sense though. The younger ones with less experience were probably a lot less likely to survive than the older ones. Jango's heart dropped further as he wondered when Skip would be sent back to the battlefield.""Many of us are the last of our batch."" A gray-armored clone gestured to the brother at his side. ""Like Boost and me. But we have each other now, so we're happy enough.""""Even if we still miss them."" Boost nodded.The other clone with unpainted armor glanced at Skip. ""We're the last of our batch,"" he said quietly.Fives cocked his head. ""Didn't you guys join the 501st just before our last campaign?""""Yes sir."" Skip nodded. ""The others...they didn't make it.""""I'm so sorry vod'ika."" Echo walked over to squeeze their shoulders. ""Fives and I lost our batchmates our first mission as well.""""Well, look at the bright side!"" Fives was obviously trying to lighten the mood. ""You finished your first battle. That means you get paint!""""Wait, really?"" Skip's eyes widened. ""You mean it?""""Sure!"" Jesse grinned. ""Won't be shinies anymore.""""Shinies?"" Jango asked.""Yeah, we're not allowed to paint our armor until after our first battle."" Fives smirked at Boba. ""Guess that makes you a shiny too ori'vod'ika.""""Nope."" Boba glared at Fives, then glanced at the two young clones. ""Hey, you should paint now! I can help!""Skip glanced at Fives. ""Um...don't we need to ask the captain first, or something?""""Nah."" Fives waved a hand. ""He'll get over it.""""Let's get the paint!"" Jesse started toward the door and the two shiny troopers eagerly followed him.Echo sighed. ""They're even younger than we were.""Fives nodded silently, frowning after the pair""Yeah."" Kix sighed. ""They keep sending them out younger and younger. I hate it.""""They'll be okay, right?"" Jango glanced at the older clones.None of them would meet his eyes and Fives sighed. ""Maybe...but, to be honest, I'm surprised they survived their first battle, as young as they are. I doubt both will make it through the next.""Jango stared at him in shock. They were so bright and happy...he couldn't bear the thought of either lying dead on a battlefield.""We got it!"" The two shinies ran back in with buckets of paint, followed by Jesse.Boba excitedly sat between the two batchmates as they started discussing how to paint their armor.""What's your name anyway?"" Boba asked Skip's batchmate.The unnamed clone shrugged. ""Don't have one yet. Everyone just calls me '04.""Jango's heart broke a little more at that.""Well, we'll have to fix that soon."" Fives smiled.Echo nodded. ""Better choose before someone names you something awful. That's how I got my name.""""Hey!"" Fives shoved his brother. ""You love your name.""""I do now, but I hated it when you all gave it to me.""""Well, I wasn't going to be calling you CT-1409 forever, was I?""That reminded Jango of something. ""You've talked about CT's and CC's as well as Nulls, Alphas and Commandos. What's the difference?""""Well, everyone here's a CT. CC's are the command class. The highest rank a CT can get is captain.""Jango frowned. ""Why?""Jesse shrugged. ""Just the way it is. The CC's are supposedly engineered to be leaders.""Fives snorted. ""It's stupid. Rex should be a commander. He was even raised in a command batch!""Jango silently agreed with Fives. ""Okay, and what about the others?""""Commandos had specialized training, usually with a Mandalorian trainer, and the Alphas were a hundred of the first clones. You...er, Prime taught them.""Jango blinked. ""So...was he like...more of a buir for them?""""I don't think so,"" Boba, surprisingly, spoke up. ""But Buir would get really annoyed if any of the other trainers messed with them.""Jesse snorted. ""Certainly didn't have a problem with them picking on us.""""Oh."" Jango dropped his eyes. ""Sorry...""Everything grew a little tense for a moment until Jango cleared his throat. ""So...that just leaves Nulls.""""Honestly, we don't know much about them,"" Kix said.""They were supposed to be decommissioned, but I heard some Mandalorian trainer saved them,"" Fives added.Boba made an annoyed huff and Echo glanced at him. ""You know them?""Boba rolled his eyes. ""I've...interacted with them on occasion. We didn't get along.""""Why?"" Jango asked.""They claimed their buir could beat you in a fight!"" Boba crossed his arms. ""When I disagreed, Ordo stuck my head down a 'fresher.""Fives, Jesse and a couple others chuckled at that, but were silenced by a glare from Boba.""Their buir?"" Jango blinked.""Kal Skirata. He's the one who saved them all from decommissioning. They call him Kal'buir and everything.""""Wow."" Echo blinked. ""I didn't know that part.""Jango vaguely recognized the name. If he remembered correctly, Kal Skirata's family had been killed, similar to his, and he too had been adopted by a Mandalorian. Maybe he and the other Mandalorian trainers would be able to help Jaster with...whatever he was going to do on Mandalore.But he was tired of thinking about politics and the like. Instead, he glanced down at Skip and his brother as Boba helped them map out patterns for their armor. It wasn't long before the intricate designs were done and the armor had been set aside to dry.Boba yawned and Jango smiled as he slid to the floor and pulled the boy into his lap. Within seconds, Boba was asleep.Then, to his shock, he felt someone settle on either side of him. Skip was on his left side and his brother was on Jango's right, both looking peaceful as they closed their eyes.""You're stuck now,"" Kix chuckled quietly. ""Shinies are notoriously difficult to dislodge once they've formed a pile.""Jango smiled and placed a hand lightly on '04's hair. ""That's okay. It's pretty comfy down here.""At almost the same time, all the clones' coms went off.""Duty calls."" Jesse sighed. ""Thank you Pr-um...Fett, for everything.""Jango smiled and nodded as the other clones filed out of the room, leaving him surrounded by the three boys. Thankfully, Boba wasn't trying to keep Jango all to himself any more. He seemed happy enough to share now, and seemed to have taken a liking to Skip and his brother.But Jango's smile faded any time he looked at the other two. How long before they'd be sent back to war? Probably to their deaths? He was slightly appalled by the older clones' attitudes about it, but he supposed they had to be somewhat callous. They'd never be able to survive otherwise. Besides, they were all obviously distraught at the thought of the two young men on the battlefield. Why couldn't anyone do something about it?You could.No. Jango pushed that thought away. I'm no buir. They'll be better off without me. Besides, Jaster's working on a plan. They'll be safe before they get sent back to war.He just hoped he was right as he wrapped an arm around each of them and drifted off to sleep. Back in Cody's quarters, Rex stared at his ori'vod in shock.""You are kidding, right?"" Fox asked.Cody shook his head. ""That's what Mereel said. He wants all of us to be officially adopted by either Fett or himself.""""And what if we don't want to be adopted?"" Wolffe snapped.Cody shrugged. ""I didn't ask, but I don't think he'd force us.""""What about who would adopt us?"" Rex asked. ""Would we get a choice in that?""""I...didn't ask."" Cody sat down. ""Sorry, he caught me off guard. And I just wanted to talk with you all about it as quick as possible.""Ponds glanced at Rex. ""Why? You have a preference?""Rex just shrugged. He had been thinking he wanted nothing to do with Fett. But then he remembered how kind and gentle this version had been. How desperate for Rex to...what? Forgive him?Then again, Mereel treated them all with great kindness as well. And there would be no taint from old memories. Maybe he would be a better choice.""I don't like this."" Fox crossed his arms. ""Wolffe's right. I don't know if I want a buir.""""I didn't say that.""Rex glanced at Wolffe, surprised. ""Then what do you mean?""Wolffe shrugged. ""I don't know. Just...what if we want someone else for a buir?""Fox snorted. ""Like who? Not that many who'd want to adopt a clone.""Wolffe just shrugged again, avoiding their eyes.""I'm sorry to dump this on you,"" Cody said. ""I know it's a lot to think about.""""Well."" Ponds crossed his arms. ""What are we going to do?""""Maybe we can talk it over with our men,"" Rex said. ""Wouldn't be the whole GAR, but we could at least get an idea what the general thought on the topic would be.""""I like that."" Ponds nodded.Rex's com went off and he glanced down. ""I have to go."" He sighed. ""Orders just came in. The 501st is shipping out in the morning, and I have to get everyone ready.""He wasn't too happy about it. His men needed a longer break, especially the younger ones like Skip. They shouldn't even be on the battlefield yet, in Rex's opinion. And as much as he hated to admit it, they might not last much longer. Still, there was nothing he could do about it but protect them the best he could.""I'll com you once I get a chance to talk to my men,"" Rex said.""See if you can sooner rather than later,"" Cody said. ""Mereel seemed anxious to get this figured out.""""Looks like we're shipping out too."" Wolffe glanced up from his com.Cody sighed. ""Okay. Well, both of you be careful.""""Always am."" Wolffe grinned before he stepped out of the room.Ponds and Fox followed a couple minutes later, but Rex hesitated. This had been nice, their whole batch on Coruscant together. But all good things had to come to an end. Rex would miss them all. And Boba. The boy had already begun to grow on him.Cody noticed him in the doorway and sighed. ""What is it vod'ika?""""I..."" Rex shook his head. ""I don't know what to think.""""I know."" Cody grabbed his shoulders. ""Just take some time to think about it and talk it over with your men. We'll take this one step at a time.""Rex closed his eyes and leaned against Cody. ""Thanks ori'vod.""""Anytime Rex'ika.""

Chapter Text
Jango woke surrounded by warmth and oddly content. For a moment, he thought he'd just drift back off to sleep. Then he heard a low chuckle.""Comfortable ad'ika?""He forced his eyes open to find Buir watching him with a soft smile. Then he felt something shift in his arms and glanced down to find his nose in a head of curly brown hair. Boba was still asleep. So were Skip and his unnamed brother, pressed against Jango's sides. Jango couldn't fight back a smile. They actually trusted him enough to let their guard down. After his first interactions with the clones, he'd feared he'd never be able to win their trust.""Don't know how long they've been here."" He glanced up to find Rex had joined Jaster. ""Everyone else has been gone for a couple hours.""Jango groaned. ""It's been that long?""Rex nodded, more at ease than Jango had ever seen the man. ""And I really hate to do this, but I need Skip and '04 to get up. We have to be ready to move out in the morning.""""What?""The three boys woke at Jango's startled cry, shifting slowly.""Buir?"" Boba rubbed his eyes. ""What's going on?""But Jango could only stare at Rex. ""They just finished a battle! You can't be going back to war already!""Rex frowned. ""We don't really have a choice. The war doesn't stop, even for all this weird Force nonsense.""Jango's glanced at Skip and '04 and his heart dropped even further when he saw the quiet resignation on their faces as they shifted away from him.Rex sighed. ""Come on you two. Time to get ready.""""Yes Captain."" They got up and started pulling their armor on, having dried during their little nap.Rex smiled. ""You painted your armor.""""Yeah."" '04 rubbed his neck. ""Fives said it was okay.""""Of course it's okay."" Rex grabbed both of them by their shoulders. ""No one can call you shinies now.""Boba glanced at the two with a frown. ""Be careful out there.""""Yeah..."" '04 smiled, but it was obviously forced. ""We...we will.""Boba's brow furrowed and he glanced at Rex. ""Do you think...maybe I could go see some of the others before they leave?""Rex smiled. ""That's a great idea. I'm sure they'd love to have a vod'ika around for a bit.""""Not a vod'ika,"" Boba grumbled. He thought for a moment before nodding. ""Okay, I'll...go see some of them.""Then he was rushing off. Jango couldn't help but smile after him. He was relieved to see the boy was trying to connect with his brothers.Skip and his brother were just finishing getting their armor on when Skip turned back to Jango. ""Thank you Pr-"" He cut off at a look from Jango. ""I mean...Fett...for everything.""""Yeah."" '04 grinned. ""Thanks. Now we know more Mando'a than most clones ever will.""""You're welcome. But this isn't goodbye you know."" He smiled. ""I'll see both of you when you get back.""Their smiles disappeared and Skip dropped his eyes. ""If we come back...""Panic rose in Jango's chest. These two...they were so young. Physically younger than him even. And they'd already lost so much. They didn't deserve this. None of them deserved this, but these boys...how could they just be sent back to war like this? There was a good chance they wouldn't come back.""Hey now."" Rex pulled Skip into a hug. ""Don't talk like that."" But Jango could see in Rex's eyes that he silently agreed with them.Skip shrugged. ""We got sent out early. We weren't ready. Chances are, we'll...we'll...""He straightened, pulling away from Rex. ""Sorry Captain.""Rex shook his head. ""It's okay to be scared Skip.""'04 sighed. ""I just wish I had a name before we go.""Jango stared at him. ""Parjii,"" he blurted without thinking. Jaster sucked in a breath and Rex's eyes widened slightly.'04 turned to him. ""What?""Jango took a deep breath before grabbing the boy's shoulders. ""Parjii,"" he repeated. ""Victor, winner. With a name like that, you could never be defeated out there.""The boy's eyes widened. He stared at Jango a moment before repeating the name. ""Parjii."" A slow grin spread across his face. ""Parjii. I'm Parjii."" He threw his arms around Jango. ""Thank you!""Jango's heart jumped to his mouth as Parjii stiffened, realizing what he'd just done. He quickly backed away. ""Sorry...I...""Jango wanted to reassure him that he did nothing wrong, but all he could do was stare.""Congratulations!"" Skip hugged his brother. ""Parjii. I love it!""Rex caught Jango's eye and nodded with a small smile.""Rex."" Jango shook his head. ""Do they...do they really have to go?""""There's...nothing I can do to change that."" Rex sighed.
But I can.
Jango froze at the thought, elated and yet terrified at the same time.""Parjii, Skip, we have to go,"" Rex said quietly.""No.""Rex's gaze turned hard. ""Fett...don't make this harder.""But Jango had had enough. He grabbed both boys' shoulders and closed his eyes, determined to do this before he lost his nerve.""Ni kyr'tayl gai sa'ad, Parjii, Skip.""One of them gasped, and Jango was glad he'd made sure to teach them the adoption vow. He was almost afraid to open his eyes. What was he thinking? He should have at least asked first, given them a choice. But now he'd taken that away from them too.But before he got a chance to start apologizing, he was being tackled to the ground. He fell with a grunt, wondering if they were actually attacking him. But...no. Skip was laughing and Parjii was crying.""Vor entye!"" Parjii sobbed. ""Vor entye. Thank you!""""Does...does this mean we don't have to fight anymore?"" Skip glanced at Rex and Jango followed his gaze.For a moment, Jango thought Rex might be angry at him. His face was blank and he was just staring at them. But then, Jango noticed Rex's eyes were shining. It was only a moment before he smiled.""Well...I guess that depends on what your new buir says.""Jango tightened his grip on his boys. ""They're not going back to war.""""Buir,"" Skip repeated, staring at Jango in wonder. ""Our buir.""""Yes."" Jango managed to stand up again while the two were still clinging to him. ""Yes, ner ad'ike.""""Well...congratulations.""  Rex had a similar look of wonder as he stared at Jango.""What about you?"" Parjii asked. ""And all the others?""Rex shook his head. ""We've survived this far, I'm sure we can survive a little longer. Everyone will just be happy for you!""Jango swallowed. He hadn't thought about how the other clones would feel about this, Jango saving these two while the rest still returned to war. But...Rex seemed truly happy.""Come on."" Skip nudged Parjii's shoulder. ""Let's tell the others.""Parjii glanced at Jango. ""Is that okay?""""Of course it is. Go. Spend some time with your vode.""The pair rushed off, practically bouncing off the walls. As soon as they were gone, Rex turned to face Jango.""Thank you.""Jango shrugged. ""I...don't know what came over me."" He met Rex's gaze. ""And...it really wasn't fair to the rest of you, I know. But...""Rex shook his head. ""Cody told us about your plan. Most of us still need a little time to think about it.""Plan? What plan?""But for those two..."" Rex glanced after the two young troopers. ""That was a wonderful thing you just did. The younger they are, the less a chance they have of coming back alive. We all risk our lives on the battlefield, but frankly, I'm surprised those two survived this long. You probably just saved their lives.""Jango nodded slowly. ""Still...I should have asked them about it first. And talked it over with you. You're the closest thing they have to a guardian.""""Maybe, but I won't hold it against you. You were trying to help them and they're happy about it."" Rex frowned. ""That doesn't mean all of us are ready to be adopted on the spot.""""I know. I won't do it again. And I don't want to keep them from you. I just..."" Jango shook his head, mind wandering to the fact that the clones were all just boys, despite how they looked. ""They're so young...""""That they are.""They were quiet for a moment before Rex sighed. ""Well...better make sure everyone else is going to be ready to go.""He turned and started walking away.""Rex.""He turned back and Jango let out a breath.""Thank you for understanding.""Rex smiled. ""You are different, no denying that. And...after some time...I think there are many other vode who might want you for a buir as well.""And with that, he turned and left. Jango couldn't help but wonder if Rex included himself in that category.Jango turned from the doorway to find Jaster beaming at him. He'd almost forgotten about Buir in all the excitement.""Well done ner ad.""Jango let out a nervous laugh. ""I still don't think I went about that right. But...they're safe now. That's all that matters."" He frowned. ""I'm not sure what plan Rex was talking about though.""""Ah."" Jaster rubbed his neck. ""Yes, about that...Cody probably told him.""""Told him what?""""Jango."" Jaster grabbed his shoulders. ""These boys need out of here before any more die. There's only one way to do that.""Jango's mouth went dry as realization crashed down on him. ""You...you want me to adopt all of them? Now?""""As many as you feel you can and who want it,"" Jaster said. ""But you won't be alone. I'll adopt some as well.""Jango blinked. ""But that isn't right! Shouldn't we get to know them before they become our ade? I at least had a few hours with Skip and Parjii, and I thought I was rushing things!""Jaster sighed. ""It isn't ideal. But there isn't an ideal solution. You want to save them, right?""""Of course."" Jango crossed his arms.""Then we have to be the ones to do it. No one else will. Most people see them as no different from droids.""Jango swallowed. He was right, of course. Nobody was going to do anything to save his sons. It was up to him, even if he was terrified.""I...can't do this,"" Jango whispered. ""I can't be a father to so many. Nobody can.""""No."" Jaster sighed. ""As I said, this isn't ideal. But it will save their lives.""Jango was quiet for a moment, contemplating the situation. ""I'm scared Buir.""""I know. And that's okay. They are too. This is something none of the clones have ever even considered before.""Jango was quiet for a moment, taking it all in. He still didn't see how he could possibly be the father these boys deserved. But he couldn't let them continue to die like this. Something had to be done, and soon. Finally, he took a deep breath.""I'll do it.""Jaster smiled. ""I knew you would.""""So what next?""""I've already talked it over with Cody. Now, it's up to him and the others to decide if they'll accept our offer, and then figure out how this will be done."" Jaster smiled. ""But we can worry about the details later. Let's go find my new bu'ade.""Jango's heart lifted at those words. ""Thanks Buir.""""You'll do fine Jango. You'll see. You'll do great.""Jango could only hope he was right.

Chapter Text
Boba was on edge as he made his way through the barracks. He wasn't quite sure why he'd wanted to see some of the other clones. Well, maybe he knew part of it. With the way everyone was talking, he'd wanted to get away from Skip and his brother. He'd seen the looks on all the others' faces. They didn't expect those two to come back. And that thought sent an icy feeling to the pit of Boba's stomach, putting him on edge.He'd never thought about it back on Kamino, what would happen to the clones. He knew they were going to war. He knew many would die. But it had never quite struck home as it had in that moment. Somehow, he'd found himself liking the two young clones. It had been a lot of fun to help them paint their armor. They were nice to him, almost like they looked up to him. As if he was their ori'vod, despite his being physically smaller.Quite frankly, he didn't want them to die. And there was nothing he could do about it.But it wasn't just them. There were millions of men who shared his father's face, boys back on Kamino who shared Boba's face. He couldn't ignore that any longer. That was another reason he thought he should visit with some of the others who were leaving. He wanted them to know he cared. So far, he hadn't really interacted with anyone but his batchmates yet. But the blue-armored troopers had seemed nice enough.After wandering for a while, he found a bunk room with several of the 501st troopers inside, preparing to depart. They weren't wearing their armor anymore and he had a harder time telling them apart in just their blacks. But he recognized Fives, Kix, and Jesse from their tattoos, and assumed the trooper at Fives' side was Echo.""Hey ori'vod'ika."" He glanced over as Fives waved at him. ""Miss us already?""Boba just shrugged, dropping his eyes.""You alright?"" Echo came closer, watching him with worried eyes.""I'm fine."" Boba turned to leave, suddenly wondering what he'd been thinking. Why would any of them want to see him? ""Sorry, I know you're all busy.""""Never too busy for a brother,"" Jesse said.Boba flinched a little.""Hey."" Echo knelt in front of him and grabbed his shoulder. ""What is it?""Boba swallowed. ""It's just...why are you okay with me being your brother?"" Because while that was what he'd found himself wanting more than anything, he couldn't imagine why they'd want him for a brother now. He'd already messed up so much.Echo's brow furrowed and the room grew quieter as the others paused to listen in, looking worried.""I...I never treated any of you right growing up. Kote and...my batchmates knew me at least, but why are you all giving me another chance?""Echo was quiet for a moment before he spoke. ""Honestly, I don't think I can give you a good answer. We all love our brothers, even the ones we've never met.""""Besides, you're basically part of the captain's batch,"" Jesse added. ""That makes you family.""""Does there have to be a reason?"" Fives asked.Boba shrugged. ""I guess not. Just seems strange.""""Well..."" Boba yelped as Fives grinned and scooped Boba into his arms. ""Maybe we just want a vod'ika around to cuddle with.""""Not a vod'ika."" But Boba's words lost their heat when a giggle which normally would have embarrassed him escaped his lips.""Physically, you are.""Boba groaned dramatically as Fives set him down. Yes, he could get used to this. He'd been alone for so long. It was nice to have others around to talk to.""Boba."" Kix was eying him suddenly. ""When was the last time you had a medical examination?""""Um, not since before Buir..."" He trailed off, remembering what happened on Geonosis.""Way to go Kix!"" Jesse smacked his brother's shoulder. ""Now you did it. You made the ik'aad sad!""""I'm not a baby!"" Boba crossed his arms.Kix rolled his eyes. ""He's a growing child. He needs to be examined periodically.""""You know he can hear you, right?"" Boba grumbled. ""And I'm fine. Nothing wrong with me.""Kix eyed him for a moment before moving to the door. ""Wait here.""""What?"" Boba called after him. ""Why?""Jesse laughed. ""Sorry ori'vod'ika, but you're not getting out of this.""""Getting out of what?""Kix returned a moment later with a medic's kit.""Oh no."" Boba shifted to hide behind Jesse. ""You're not doing this.""""Yes I am,"" Kix said stubbornly. ""Now come on. Or do you want me to tell your buir?""Boba paused at that. This new version of Buir hadn't seemed concerned about medical stuff. But if Kix did say something to him, he might drag Boba off to some stuffy doctor's office for a full examination. And to be honest, he'd much rather the 501st medic look him over quickly.""Fine.""He crossed his arms and sat down on the nearest bunk. Kix sat next to him and Boba was relieved to find Kix was a lot more gentle than the last doctor he'd been around. Buir had always trusted his medical care to the Kaminoans, said they'd know best if something was wrong. But they'd always been cold, poking and prodding him in ways he really didn't like. This was different. With every move he made, Kix made it clear just how much he cared.The others continued their preparations to move out while Kix finished his examination. When he finally finished, the medic nodded with a slight frown.""How often did you eat when you were on your own?""Boba shrugged. ""Whenever I could.""Kix sighed and Jesse glanced over at them. ""What's wrong?""""He's pretty healthy, all things considered. But he is significantly underweight for a cadet of this physical age.""Boba frowned. He thought he'd eaten pretty well on his own. Then again, he'd had other priorities.Kix glanced back at him. ""Boba, I'm going to talk to your buir before we leave. Make sure he knows you need an increased caloric intake.""Boba rolled his eyes. ""You can just tell me, you know. I've been on my own for a while now. I can take care of myself.""""But you don't have to anymore."" Kix smiled.And Boba couldn't find it in himself to argue at that. They all grew quiet after that as the troopers continued their preparations. Boba was just thinking he'd go see if he could find Kote and the others, make sure to say bye to Wolffe before he left, when Skip and his brother tore into the room, panting.""We...he...we aren't going to fight anymore!"" Skip panted.""And I'm Parjii!"" His brother grinned. ""He...he gave me a name!""""Woah, woah, slow down."" Echo held up his hands before glancing at the formerly unnamed brother. ""Wait, you're saying Fett gave you a name?""""Parjii."" He nodded, a huge smile plastered on his face.""And what's all this about not fighting?"" Fives asked.""Buir said so!"" Skip grinned. ""He adopted us! Said the special vow and everything!""Boba's stomach swooped and he froze. The other clones surged forward, all talking at once. But Boba tuned them out. He felt...he wasn't exactly sure how he felt. Buir had just...adopted them? Just like that? Was Boba not enough for him?But...no. That wasn't right either. He'd been excited by the idea that Buir would eventually adopt the rest of Boba's batch. And he liked Skip and Parjii. They were physically a little younger than the others, and it made it easier not to feel so distant from them. But he just hadn't expected Buir to adopt them. Especially not without talking to Boba first. Not to mention the fact that this version hadn't even formally adopted Boba yet. Did that mean Boba wasn't actually his son, but these two were?""Hey."" He jumped at a hand on his arm and glanced up to find Kix watching him with a concerned expression. ""You okay?""He then realized everyone had quieted down and was staring at him. Skip and Parjii's expressions had become very nervous.""Boba..."" Skip took a step forward. ""I...I'm sorry. I didn't think about how you would feel, if you'd want to share your buir. It's just...""Boba swallowed the lump in his throat. ""He...he didn't do that for me.""An uncomfortable silence followed that comment until another voice spoke up.""There's more to it."" Rex walked into the room, followed by Kote. ""Boba, we're being shipped out tomorrow. Parjii and Skip..."" He shook his head. ""There was a good chance they wouldn't come back.""""It's not that your buir doesn't care for you."" Cody smiled at Boba. ""Even this version already loves you. But this is different. Your dad did this because he cares for them, but also because he was trying to save their lives.""And suddenly, Boba felt like the spoiled little boy that cadets glared at in the halls again. He'd only been thinking of himself. He'd known the danger of Parjii and Skip returning to the battlefield. He'd been horrified by the thought of them never coming back. But when it had impacted his life, he'd become a selfish little brat all over again.""We're both really sorry,"" Parjii said.""No."" Boba let a true smile cross his face. ""No, I'm so sorry. I was just surprised.""He walked toward them and they both knelt to be on his level, still looking nervous. Then he reached forward and pulled both their foreheads to rest against his own.""I'm proud to have you as my vod'ike. And I promise, I'll be the best ori'vod in the galaxy. Haat, ijaa, haa'it.""Then he was being wrapped in two hugs.""Thank you ori'vod.""And for some reason, that term didn't feel weird coming from these two, even if they were bigger than him.He glanced up to find Cody was smiling at him with pride in his eyes. The expression made Boba's heart soar the same way it always had when Buir had looked at him like that. Yes, this was good. He would need to talk to Buir, but everything was going to be okay. And he would never forget his promise to his little brothers.

Chapter Text
Wolffe's mind was a million miles away even as he went through the motions of getting ready to depart. He didn't know what his batchmates planned to do, but he did not want to be adopted by a weird version of Prime or the man's buir. And he knew every man in the 104th would feel the same. They didn't need any other father.""Commander."" He was pulled out of his thoughts as General Koon walked up next to him. ""You seem distracted today.""""Sorry sir.""The general observed him for a moment. ""Is this because of what Jaster Mereel proposed for you and your brothers?""Wolffe's eyes widened. ""How did you know about that?""""Kenobi talked it over with me. He is aware that I am...close with my men.""Wolffe nodded as he moved to continue preparations, but he was stopped by a hand on his shoulder.""I know this is bothering you, and we need to discuss it. We have time.""Wolffe just sighed and allowed his general to lead him away, knowing better than to argue. When they'd found a quiet room away from Wolffe's brothers, General Plo turned to face him with crossed arms.""Now, what is bothering you?""Wolffe was quiet just a moment before sighing. ""It's just...you once told us that we're the closest thing you'll ever have to sons of your own.""The general nodded. ""And I meant that. I love each and every one of you dearly.""""But now...Fett and Mereel want to adopt us. They don't even know us.""""No. This is more a formality in an attempt to save your lives. That is not to say they don't care for you. They wouldn't be doing this if they didn't care.""""But..."" Wolffe dropped his eyes. ""They can't care for us as much as you do.""The general was quiet for a moment. Wolffe nearly went ahead and asked, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. Their general had already done so much for them. He couldn't ask him to do this as well. The Jedi Council would never approve.Finally, General Plo sighed. ""Wolffe."" He grabbed Wolffe's shoulders. ""Do you want me to formally adopt all of you instead? Because if you do, it would be my honor.""""But..."" Wolffe shook his head. ""The Council...I can't ask you to do this.""""You don't have to. It's something I should have done a long time ago. To be honest, I never thought it was something you'd all want.""""Neither did I,"" Wolffe admitted. ""Until I heard what they wanted to do. And I....well, I just couldn't imagine having anyone but you as my buir.""Plo nodded. ""Very well. I need to speak with your brothers and make sure this is what they want as well.""""It is.""""I would still like to discuss it with them personally. Then I can see about how to go about it. I'm not sure exactly what Republic policy is on the matter.""""You could just do it the Mandalorian way,"" Wolffe suggested. ""A simple vow, and it's done. I'm sure that's how Fett and Mereel plan to do it.""""I know the Mandalorian adoption vow. ""Wolffe raised his eyebrows. ""You do?""""Yes. I won't pretend this is the first time I've considered adopting all of you. I figured, since many of you learned of Mandalorian culture growing up, that would be how you would prefer it."" Plo paused. ""Do you think...would you like me to go ahead and say it for you now?""Wolffe caught his breath.""You don't have to, of course, if you'd rather wait for your brothers...""""Yes."" Wolffe nodded. Maybe he was being a little selfish, but he couldn't wait any longer. ""Please, I'm ready now.""Plo nodded. ""Ni kyr'tayl gai sa'ad Wolffe.""Wolffe smiled at that, hardly believing this was happening. ""Thank you.""Even though he couldn't see it through the mask, he could hear the smile on his general's face as he was pulled into a hug. ""You are most welcome, my son."" Jango walked through the clone barracks beside Jaster, trying to find Boba and his two new sons. It seemed word about them had traveled fast. Earlier, Jango had only gotten a few odd looks. He now realized the clones had been wondering why a brother was wandering around wearing Mandalorian armor with a Mandalorian in tow. Now, they were openly staring at him in shock and disbelief, unable to understand how the Prime was here.""Cody!"" Jaster called as the commander wandered past, all attention on a data pad.Cody glanced up. ""I hope you aren't expecting an answer yet.""""No."" Jaster laughed. ""Though I thought you should know, Jango and I talked it over, and we both agree this is for the best.""Jango swallowed, still hoping he could follow through with that promise.Cody nodded. ""I talked it over with my batchmates, and we agreed to discuss it with our men first and see what some of them think.""""Good."" Jaster nodded. ""That's a good start.""""I know you're in a hurry. Hopefully, we'll have an answer for you within a few days.""""I would prefer to talk it over with your batchmates in person.""Cody sighed. ""Unfortunately, that will be very difficult.""""I've heard. Some are leaving."" Jaster paused. ""Would it be possible to arrange a holocall after they've discussed it with their men?""""That could work."" Cody nodded.""Good. Tell me when will work. I don't seem to have much else to do until Kenobi arranges a meeting with Kryze."" Jaster grimaced. He'd told Jango of Kenobi's plan to meet with the New Mandalorian leader, and Jango couldn't say he was particularly looking forward to it either.""I'll talk to them before they go."" Cody turned to Jango. ""All three of your ade are in the 501st bunkroom, if that's who you're looking for.""""Thanks."" Jango swallowed. ""I...take it you've heard about Parjii and Skip?""""Yeah."" Cody smiled. ""Don't let him know I told you this, but that went a long way to winning Rex over.""Jango shrugged. ""It just...seemed right. But I also feel bad that I just picked Skip and Parjii. There are probably many other young clones who...who...""""There are."" Cody sighed. ""But this is war. Some will die. As much as we hate it, we've had to come to accept it. That doesn't make it hurt any less every time we lose a brother.""They were quiet for a moment as Jango let those words sink in.""Well,"" Jaster said. ""If this works, we can stop all of that soon.""Cody shook his head a little. ""It hardly seems possible.""""It is. You'll see.""Cody nodded and began to continue on his way, but stopped and glanced at Jango again. ""You might want to have a talk with Boba, by the way.""Jango frowned. ""Why...oh..."" Then it hit him. He had just adopted two boys without even mentioning the idea to Boba. That...probably wasn't the best idea.""I messed up, didn't I?""""It's not as bad as you'd think."" Cody smiled. ""He was just caught off-guard. But he's already got an ori'vod's protective gleam in his eye.""Jaster chuckled. ""From what I've seen, I'm not surprised.""""Thank you."" Jango nodded. ""I'll go talk to him.""Jaster sighed as they continued. ""Stop worrying. Cody said Boba was okay with this.""""Still, I really could have handled this better in so many ways...""""You saved their lives. That's the important thing. I have a feeling Boba agrees.""Jango glanced at his buir. ""But what if it had really made Boba angry? He's just barely come to see the clones as his vode. This could have ruined everything for him.""Jaster shook his head. ""It's no use dwelling on the past.""Finally, they found the 501st barracks. Boba was sitting on a bunk between Parjii and Skip, the three listening intently as Fives told them some pretty outlandish stories about missions he'd been on.""Hey, look who it is!"" Jesse grinned at Jango. ""Here to steal more of our vod'ike?""Jango blanched. ""I wasn't trying to steal anybody!""""Ah, leave him alone Jesse."" Fives grinned. ""You've seen how excited they are about their new buir. It's adorable!""Parjii turned bright red and dropped his gaze.""Um...Fett?"" Skip looked suddenly uncomfortable.Jaster sighed. ""You'd better get used to calling him Buir.""Skip glanced at Jango nervously and he smiled. ""It's what I am after all.""""Buir."" Skip managed a nervous smile. ""I was just wondering, can you formally adopt Boba too? He says you haven't yet.""""Skip!"" Boba hissed. ""I told you not to say anything!""Jango's eyes widened. ""I...hadn't thought of that. I just...when we got here you said you were my son and I...""""I know."" Boba shook his head. ""It's stupid. I don't think Buir...the old you...I don't think he ever said the gai bal manda. But...you're not exactly him, and you adopted them, so..."" He glanced up for a second before dropping his gaze. ""I know it's stupid.""""No it isn't."" Jango knelt in front of him. ""It's only right. Ni kyr'tayl gai sa'ad Boba.""Boba glanced back up with a relieved look. ""Thank you. I'm sorry.""""There's nothing to be sorry for. Now there's no doubt you're my sons."" He glanced up at Parjii and Skip. ""All of you.""The pair grinned and Boba leaned against Jango's side with a content sigh.""So...Buir."" Parjii swallowed. ""Are we...going back with you?""""I..."" Jango glanced at the other clones. ""I wasn't sure if you wanted to...""""It would be better,"" Fives offered. ""We're transferring to the cruiser tonight."" He grinned. ""Don't want you two accidently getting dragged back to war.""Jango smiled at his sons. ""Have all your things?""""Not like we have much,"" Skip said, breaking Jango's heart a little more. ""Our...our armor isn't even ours, technically...""""Don't worry about that."" Fives smiled. ""No one will miss a couple sets of armor. Besides, you painted it. It's yours.""They both looked relieved at that, scooping up their helmets.""Okay then."" Jango nodded. ""I don't see any reason why you can't come with.""The two exchanged a grin before going around and giving their brothers quick hugs.""Be careful vode."" Parjii pulled away from Kix.""Don't worry."" Kix smiled. ""We'll see you soon. I'll make sure all these guys get back in one piece.""""You'd better."" Skip finished hugging Echo and they both walked to Jango's side. Boba grinned up at them, looking excited.""Ready?"" Jango asked.""Yes Buir.""""Good."" Jango smiled as he turned. ""Let's go home.""

Chapter Text
They were still in hyperspace when Rex got around to having a discussion with his men about Fett and Mereel's proposal. Cody had already arranged a holocall to discuss it in a couple days, and he didn't know when he'd have another chance to talk to all of them. So, he made his way to the rec room where Torrent was gathered.""Captain!"" Hardcase waved. ""Want to join a round of Sabacc?""""Sorry Hardcase, but I'm actually going to have to interrupt your game."" He glanced around the room. ""There's something we need to discuss...""""Ha!"" Tup slammed his cards down and got up. ""Good. Serves you right for cheating.""Hardcase made an affronted sound. ""I would never!""""Yeah you would."" Fives threw his cards down as well. ""How else have you won every hand?""""What's this about, sir?"" Echo asked after everyone in the room had turned their attention to Rex.""I take it even those of you who didn't meet them are aware that Jango Fett and his father Jaster Mereel have been pulled to our time from the past?"" He'd be shocked if they didn't. It wasn't like the two had been hiding.""You're serious?"" Dogma was staring at Rex with wide eyes. ""I thought Fives and Jesse were joking!""""We told you!"" Fives crossed his arms. ""Honestly vod'ika, not believing your own brothers."" He shook his head with a grin.""Yes, it's true."" Rex nodded. ""And...well...I don't know how much any of you interacted with Prime. I for one had some...bad experiences with the man.""Coric huffed from the corner of the room. ""Yeah...he wasn't exactly easy on any of us. Thought he was going to take my head off once.""""I always thought it would be interesting to meet him,"" Tup said. ""But...after some of the things I heard...""Fives' brow creased. ""Honestly, what I've seen so far really doesn't line up with the stories I've heard.""One of the older troopers snorted. ""I find that hard to believe.""""Believe me, I understand your concern. In truth, when I first saw this Fett, I was furious."" Rex paused for a moment before continuing. ""I...don't share this often, but...I was slated for decommissioning as a cadet.""There were no gasps or panicked cries. Just a sad silence.""Most of you know Commander Cody and I are close. He tried to get Prime to step in, but he refused."" Rex waved vaguely to his head. ""Said I was defective.""""But...obviously you weren't decommissioned,"" Hardcase said.""Alpha-17 stepped in. Got me transferred to Cody's squad, despite how unusual it was.""Everyone was quiet for a moment.""Suffice it to say, I have my reasons for hating Prime."" Rex took a deep breath. ""But this man, this Fett...he is not Prime.""Several confused looks met this statement, but no one spoke.""I think he...he actually cares for us."" Rex shook his head. ""He was furious when he found out how old we really are. And he's furious with his past self for what he did to us.""""What about his dad?"" Dogma asked.Rex chuckled. ""Oh, he's mad too. Wants us to have rights as Mandalorian citizens. And to that end...""He wasn't quite sure how to say this part.""Well, I'm sure you know Fett adopted Skip and '04. He also gave '04 a name: Parjii. The Mando'a word for victor. But they want to do more."" He paused one more time before plunging onward. ""They want to adopt each and every clone in the GAR.""Rex held his breath, waiting for the chaos of questions. But it never came. Every trooper in the room just stared at him.Tup was the one to finally break the silence. ""So...we'd actually have a buir?""""Yes."" Rex nodded. ""Either Fett or Mereel would be your buir, depending on who each trooper chooses.""""But...why are they doing this?"" Dogma asked. ""They don't know us.""""No."" Rex shook his head. ""But like I said, Fett feels guilty about what happened to us. This would do more than just give us a buir. It would mean we'd no longer have to fight for the Republic. We'd be free to do whatever we wanted.""""Seriously?"" Echo's eyes widened.""We each are going to have a choice whether or not we want this, and a say in who adopts us, if we have a preference.""""You say this like it's a sure thing,"" Kix said.""It is. My batch and I agreed to talk it over with some of our men. Depending on how all of you feel about this, we'll get in touch with the rest of the GAR and make arrangements for the official adoptions to take place.""""What are you going to do?"" Jesse was staring at Rex with a slight frown.Rex swallowed. He'd known they'd ask him, so he'd put some serious thought into it. While he still had a big decision to make, he'd at least figured part of it out.""I'm going to do it.""""Which one?"" Fives asked.Rex chuckled. ""That's the question, isn't it? I had been thinking Mereel, but Fett's grown on me. He did save Skip and Parjii, afterall.""""Well."" Coric crossed his arms. ""If it means I don't have to watch my brothers die anymore, I'm in. But not with Fett, no matter how much you say he's changed.""Several other older clones murmured in agreement.""I'll take Fett."" Jesse grinned. ""His buir's nice and all, but Fett is technically the closest thing we have to a buir anyway.""Kix nodded slowly. ""Well, guess I'll be with Jesse.""Others spoke up, all saying they liked the idea. Some said they'd prefer Mereel or didn't really care, but a surprising number said they'd want to be with Fett. That surprised Rex a bit, but he supposed he could understand. The man was their genetic template afterall.When almost everyone had voiced his opinion, Rex turned to the Domino twins. ""What about you?"" He was a little surprised Fives hadn't already spoken up.Fives just stared at him for a moment, blinking. Echo, meanwhile, was staring off into the distance. That was not the reaction Rex had expected, not from Fives at least. He was usually excitable about these sort of things.""Fives?"" Rex prodded.Fives swallowed before dropping his eyes. ""What if...what if we want somebody else for a buir?""Rex blinked. It had seemed strange enough when Wolffe had asked that, but at least Rex had his suspicions as to who he was thinking of. But he had no idea who else Fives could want for a buir.""I...I'm sure you could choose somebody else, if they wanted you."" He tilted his head. ""If you don't mind me asking, who are you thinking?""Fives glanced up to meet Echo's eyes and something unsaid passed between them. After a moment, Echo smiled and nodded.Fives let out a long breath before looking up to meet Rex's eyes. ""You, Captain.""Rex blinked. That was the last thing he'd expected to hear, and he had no idea what to say.Fives took his silence wrong and quickly ducked his head. ""It's stupid, and I'm sure you don't want to...""""Fives."" Rex quickly grabbed his shoulders. ""It's not stupid, and I'm not angry. I...you just surprised me. I never knew you thought of me like that.""""You and Cody saved us,"" Echo said. ""And then you took us in. We look up to you Rex."" He smiled. ""I don't think either of us have actually thought of you as a buir, but you have always been more than just our ori'vod.""""Well..."" Rex smiled. ""I...I'd be honored. But..."" He sighed. ""I'm not exactly sure how all this is going to work. You two might not get the same rights as the rest of us this way.""""I think they would if you were adopted by Fett or Mereel,"" Dogma said.""What would you know about it?"" Tup asked.Dogma shrugged. ""I've read a lot about Mandalorian culture.""""In that case..."" Rex turned back to the twins. ""I'll as them about it. If you'll still get full rights, then I'll gladly say the gai bal manda for both of you.""Fives grinned. ""Thanks Rex!""""What if others want you for their buir?"" Dogma asked.""I...I..."" Rex thought for a moment. Would there really be others who'd want him to be their buir? Is that what Dogma wanted? Would any of the tubies back on Kamino rather have an older brother for a father? That thought made him feel weird. He found himself liking the idea of raising vod'ike, and he wouldn't have to raise them just to fight a war. But he also wasn't sure if he was even capable of raising children. That was very different from adopting some of his men, and even that thought scared him a little.Still, he could think about the tubies later. For now...if this was what his men really wanted...""I'd be honored to adopt anyone from the 501st, if that's what they really want."" He smiled a little.""Something tells me many vode might prefer their captains or commanders to be their buir as well,"" Echo said. ""Just someone we're familiar with and already look up to.""Rex nodded. ""I'll bring the idea up to them. My batch is having a call to discuss this with Fett and Mereel in a couple days.""""Make sure to ask how Skip and Parjii are doing!"" Fives grinned.""Don't worry."" Rex chuckled. ""I have a feeling they're going to be spoiled rotten by the time we get back.""




Notes:

Someone suggested having older clones adopt some of the younger ones, and I thought that was an awesome idea! I've always thought Echo and Fives might see Rex as more of a dad than an older brother (or maybe a little bit of both), and I had Rex adopt them in my Second Life series, so I thought it might work here as well.Thanks for reading!

Chapter Text
Jaster was pleased with how the last few days had gone. Two more in their little apartment hadn't been a problem. He wanted to get Parjii and Skip some beds of their own, but they were content to curl up together on the sofa and had said it was far comfier than the bunks they were used to anyway. To his and Jango's shock, they found Boba squished between them one morning. And though Boba was very flustered when he woke up, it was obvious he liked having brothers around.He certainly enjoyed spending time with his batch. Rex and Wolffe had left the morning after Jango had adopted his three ade, and Ponds a couple days later. But Cody was still on Coruscant and absolutely doted on Boba. Fox joined them occasionally, but the man was overworked.However, despite how well things had gone, Jaster was decidedly not looking forward to the next few days. Kenobi had finally arranged a meeting on Mandalore, though he'd been vague on the details. Jaster wondered just how much he'd told Duchess Kryze. He hoped he'd at least mentioned the fact that he was bringing the dead Mand'alor with him. Although, it could prove amusing if he hadn't.But they weren't due to leave for Mandalore until the next day. Today, all the commanders and Rex had agreed to meet with Jaster and Jango over a holocall to discuss how to move forward with the adoption of the GAR.Boba had taken Skip and Parjii to spend time with some of Cody's men. Evidently, one of them called Waxer was particularly fond of children and had been asking about Boba to no end. And while he was still nervous around the other clones, Boba was really trying to connect with as many as he could. So, it was just Jaster, Jango, Cody and Fox in the apartment as they waited for the others, something Jango was having a hard time with.Fox sighed as he watched Jango pace. ""Prime, will you sit down already? You're making me tired.""Jango flinched, eyes darting to Fox. ""Please don't call me that. I'm not...I'm not him.""Fox just shrugged.""Why are you so worried Fett?"" Cody asked. ""We're just talking to them. You've already done that.""Jango didn't answer, but Jaster had a pretty good idea of what was bothering him. Scared of being a father to so many. Worried about failing them. Hoping for their forgiveness for something he'd never done. But Jaster had seen how Jango acted around the three he had adopted. He absolutely adored them, looking for any excuse to offer hugs and comfort. He was already an amazing buir, and he also loved it. He just had to realize those things for himself.It wasn't long before the other three commanding officers appeared on the holo.""You should know,"" Wolffe said as soon as he appeared. ""Neither me nor any of my men will be accepting your offer.""Cody stared at Wolffe. ""That's it? You won't even consider it?""""I'm sorry, but..."" Wolffe took a deep breath and dropped his gaze. ""We already have a buir.""""What?"" Fox snapped.Rex stared at him for a moment before laughing. ""We should've seen this coming.""And then, Cody's eyes widened as well.""I have no problem with this,"" Jaster said slowly. ""But...who?""""Our general,"" Wolffe said. ""Jedi Master Plo Koon.""Jaster frowned. He wasn't sure how he felt about a jetii adopting his bu'ade. But there wasn't much he could do about it. If Wolffe trusted his general, then Jaster would have to trust his judgement.Jango, for his part, didn't look worried. ""That's fine Wolffe."" He smiled. ""I'm glad you found a buir already.""""Just when did this happen?"" Fox asked.Wolffe rubbed his neck. ""Right before we left Coruscant.""""And what brought that on?"" Ponds asked.""Well...he once told us he thought of us as his sons. And then...I don't know. I never cared to be adopted, but when you were wanting to..."" He vaguely gestured toward Jaster and Jango. ""I don't know, everything just changed. He adopted me that day, and went through and asked every trooper after that, adopting them on the spot if they wanted it."" He smiled. ""We're all his sons now.""Rex grinned. ""Congratulations!""""I'm happy for you,"" Jango said. ""But still...if you ever need anything..."" He glanced at Jaster. ""We'll be here for you as well.""Wolffe stared at him for a moment. ""Thank you Fett.""""So."" Jaster turned to the others. ""How about the rest of you? What did your men have to say?"" Jango listened intently as Cody, Fox and Ponds told of the reactions from their men. Overall, he was pleasantly surprised with the results. Many were interested in being adopted, with only a few who outright refused. There were also several who were nervous about it, but willing to give it a try. While he was still terrified of the idea, he couldn't help but find himself getting excited.""What about your men Rex?"" Ponds asked after he finished.""Mostly the same,"" Rex said. ""Some specifically didn't want Fett to adopt them because of past problems with Prime.""Jango sighed. That was expected, but it still hurt a little.""However,"" Rex continued, ""I also had an...unexpected request.""""What was that?"" Cody asked.""Fives and Echo wanted..."" He shook his head as if dazed. ""They wanted me to be their buir.""Fox stared at him for a moment. ""That makes no sense! They're your brothers.""""True, but my relationship with them has always been a little different from the rest of my brothers."" Rex glanced at Jaster. ""I told them I'd ask you about it. I...well, I'd love to do it, honestly. But I don't want to if it'll take anything away from them.""""As long as you are adopted by one of us, it would still make them a part of my House."" Jaster smiled. ""And I have no problem with that. I wouldn't be surprised if there are more clones who'd prefer an older brother adopt them.""""I'm sure of it."" Cody suddenly grinned. ""And I wouldn't mind having some tubies running around.""""Tubies?"" Jango was still getting used to the peculiar terms the clones used.""Cadets. Kids. Just out of the tube."" Fox shook his head. ""Why would you want some of them? Sounds like a big headache.""""I wondered about that too,"" Rex said slowly, ""but I'm not sure if I can...you know, raise kids. It's different with my men.""Cody smiled. ""You'd be fine Rex, if you actually wanted to.""Fox tilted his head for a moment. ""I don't know. It still seems a little strange to me, but..."" He sighed. ""I can think of several shinies in the Guard who...well..."" He couldn't seem to finish the thought.Jango smiled. ""I like this plan. It'll mean some of the younger clones will still be free, but they'll also have a buir they're comfortable with.""Jaster nodded. ""I agree. I wouldn't have expected this, but it does actually make a lot of sense.""""Still,"" Jango continued, ""We're glad to adopt any of your brothers.""""And there were many who were interested,"" Cody said.""Excellent!"" Jaster nodded. ""How soon can we begin?""""Well..."" Cody blinked. ""I guess that depends on how you want to do this. Are you just planning on saying the vow followed by each name?""Fox chuckled. ""Good luck with that. It'll take a while.""""No."" Jango crossed his arms. ""We will say the vow to each individually.""They all stared at him. ""Jango,"" Jaster said slowly, ""as much as I love your enthusiasm, I'm not sure if that's possible.""""It wouldn't have to be in person,"" Jango said. ""But at least over a holocall.""""Even that would take..."" Ponds shook his head. ""A while. Even if we adopt some of our brothers.""""I don't care. We won't get to know all of them first. This is the least we can do. Speak to them face to face. Let them know we care.""""Well, I'm sure there are some who would appreciate it,"" Rex said. ""But there are others who wouldn't really care.""Jango grew silent for a moment before sighing. ""I...suppose your right. Guess we could just try to find out which of them would like to speak to us.""Jaster nodded. ""That might work. It would let us do this a little quicker without seeming impersonal.""""So, what exactly are we going to do?"" Fox glanced at Cody. ""Send out a survey with questions like, 'Who do you want to adopt you?' and 'Do you want to meet your new buir first?'.""Cody shrugged. ""That's actually a pretty good idea.""""But we'd have to be careful,"" Rex added. ""I doubt the Kaminoans or Senate would be happy if they found out about this."" He frowned. ""They probably won't let us out of the army without a fight even if we've been adopted.""Jaster sighed. ""That's why I'm meeting with Duchess Kryze. We need more allies. And as much as I don't want to work with her, it will be very helpful if her government recognizes all of you as Mandalorian citizens. I doubt the Senate could fight that.""""They'd probably try,"" Fox muttered.Cody glanced at Jaster. ""Aren't there other Mandalorians who would rally to you if they knew?""""I hope so, but the New Mandalorian government is recognized by the Senate. Besides, I don't want to start a war on Mandalore. It sounds like our people have suffered enough.""Wolffe cocked his head. ""From what I've heard, you're really not going to get along with the Duchess, or her government.""""Maybe so."" Jaster sighed. ""But I still believe this is the best place to start.""They were all quiet for a bit before Cody spoke. ""I'll start working on the details and get the word out to our brothers as quick as possible.""""Good,"" Jaster said. ""Make sure to let them know they can be adopted by other clones as well. They'll all still be part of my House, but we'll have to work out the finer details on how that would work.""Jango suddenly had an idea. ""Do...do any of you want us to...you know...go ahead?""All their eyes fixed on him in shock. ""Now?"" Fox asked. ""Really?""Jango shrugged. ""May as well start somewhere. It would be better if we were all in-person, but this will work. And that would mean you could go ahead and start adopting any of your men who want it.""They didn't say anything for a moment. Rex and Cody fixed each other with a look before Rex sighed and turned toward Jango.""I can't believe I'm saying this, but..."" He took a deep breath. ""You truly are different from Prime, and I believe you are a good man. So, if you'll have me...""Jango stared at him for a moment, shocked. He'd been sure Rex would choose Buir.""And if Rex is going with you, I am too,"" Cody said. ""No one's taking my vod'ika from me.""""I..."" Jango smiled. ""I would be honored.""Fox tilted his head. ""In that case, maybe Mereel can adopt Ponds and me. I don't personally have a preference anyway.""Jaster beamed. ""I'd be delighted to have you both as my ade.""""Are we sure we want to break up our batch?"" Ponds asked.Cody shrugged. ""Wolffe has a different buir. We'll all still be part of the same House at least. And nothing can change the fact that we're brothers.""""Okay then."" Ponds glanced at Jango. ""But...um...would that make you our vod?""Jango's eyes widened. He hadn't thought of it like that but, technically, Ponds was right.Jaster laughed. ""I suppose it would, wouldn't it?""Ponds and Fox glanced at each other, then Fox shrugged. ""Again, feels weird, but I guess it's okay.""""Just don't expect me to start calling you my ba'vodu."" Cody made a face. ""Like I said, we'll always be brothers.""Fox nodded. ""Agreed.""Jaster smiled and turned to Jango. ""Would you like to begin?""Jango nodded, heart pounding as he turned to Rex and Cody. ""Ni kyr'tayl gai sa'ad Rex, Kote.""The pair exchanged a nervous smile before Rex turned back to Jango. ""Vor entyr Buir.""Jaster smiled and turned to the other two. ""Ni kyr'tayl gai sa'ad Fox, Ponds.""Ponds grinned and even Fox couldn't hide a hesitant smile. Jango felt his heart soar at the sight. It was a start. When Rex hung up from the holocall, he could only stare off into space for a moment. He had a buir now. He was someone's son. And, if he wanted, he could have sons of his own.And he did really want that now. His doubts had vanished. No one else had come forward asking him to adopt them yet, but he had a feeling it was only a matter of time.Finally, he broke himself out of his trance and began walking through the ship. He hardly acknowledged when any of his men greeted him, too focused on his own thoughts.At last, he reached the barracks and caught the twins' eyes. They nodded and followed him to a more private room.""So?"" Fives was practically vibrating with excitement. ""What happened?""Rex smiled. ""Well...I guess I'm Rex Fett now.""""Fett?"" Echo repeated. ""I thought you'd chose Mereel.""""So did I."" Rex shrugged. ""But now that I'm part of House Mereel, you both would be as well if I adopted you.""Fives and Echo exchanged an excited glance. ""Can we do it now?"" Fives asked.""If you're both sure this is what you want...""""It is!"" Fives nodded. ""I mean...as long as you're okay with it.""Rex nodded before reaching out to grab their shoulders. ""Ni kyr'tayl gai sa'ad Fives, Echo.""Fives reached up to grasp Rex's arm, a bright smile on his face. Echo seemed frozen, staring at Rex with an awed expression. They all just stood there for some time before Fives finally broke the silence.""So..."" He cocked his head. ""Does that mean we get to call you Buir now?""Rex chuckled. ""I suppose it does.""Echo tilted his head. ""I seem to remember you telling us we were to call you 'Captain' or 'Sir'.""Rex rolled his eyes. ""That was when you were just a couple lost shinies, not my...my sons."" And boy, if anyone had told him back then...""Thank you Buir."" Fives grinned at the word.Rex could only smile and pull both of them into a hug. There was still a lot to work out, to make them all truly free. And he found himself hating the idea of taking his men, his sons, into battle again. All he could do was hope Mereel figured out a lasting solution soon, before he lost more brothers or...or his sons.He could probably take Fives and Echo and flee back to Coruscant now, if he really wanted to. They were part of House Mereel. But he couldn't abandon the rest of his men, and he knew the twins would feel the same. But he had to trust his new aliit. Fett and Mereel would figure something out soon.




Notes:

This chapter got a little long, but there were several things I wanted to include. Not sure I'm very happy with it, but I wanted to get it up. Might end up taking a couple weeks off of this fic, as there are some others I'm hoping to work on. I'm also really nervous about writing the meeting with Satine, so it might take me a while to get that part right.Thank you to everyone who's continued to read this, and have a very merry Christmas!Mando'a Translations:Ade: sonsMand'alor: sole rulerBuir: fatherJetii: JediBu'ade: grandchildrenVod'ika: little brotherVod: brotherBa'vodu: uncleNi kyr'tayl gai sa'ad: Mandalorian adoption vow (lit.

Chapter Text
""Is this some kind of joke?""Jaster just met the duchess's unimpressed gaze.""I assure you Satine, this is no Joke,"" Kenobi said.Well, that answered whether or not Kenobi had told the duchess details about them.""It is also impossible. Jaster Mereel was killed years, decades ago.""""And yet, here I am."" Jaster smiled. Even if he didn't like the woman, he didn't want to make an enemy of her if he could help it. ""It would seem my bu'ad, in an attempt to bring his buir back to life, unintentionally succeeded in bringing both Jango and me.""Jango shifted at his side and Jaster could tell he wanted to be wearing his helmet.""You honestly expect me to believe that?""""I know it's difficult to believe."" Kenobi raised his hand. ""But I brought them before the Jedi Council and we confirmed it was true. Jaster Mereel and Jango Fett have been brought here from the past through some Force artifact.""That caught the duchess's attention. ""Is that possible?""""Rare, but not impossible."" Kenobi nodded to where Boba was glaring up at her from Jango's side. ""Young Boba here managed to track down the artifact.""Duchess Kryze glanced at Boba, but he only raised his chin in defiance.""Well...I suppose I've heard of stranger occurrences."" Her eyes turned to Jango, then she glanced at the clones.It had been decided that bringing some of Jango's ade along might help their cause. Cody, because he was a good man who embodied everything the vode fought for. Parjii and Skip, because they were young and innocent, yet had been forced to fight a war. And Boba simply because he refused to be left behind.Cody was still wearing his plastoid armor, helmet tucked at his side. Parjii and Skip, on the other hand, had agreed to forgo armor and were wearing some nicer civvies Kenobi had found for them. The Jedi seemed to think it might help their cause if not all the clones appeared as soldiers.""So."" Duchess Kryze glanced at Jango again. ""You are the man who sold his blood to create an army.""Jaster expected Jango to flinch and act guilty like he had whenever anyone else had mentioned the matter, but he couldn't have been more wrong.""No."" Jango raised his head. ""I arrived in this time to find my sons serving as an army of child soldiers, slaves of the Republic.""Cody's eyes widened while Kenobi raised an eyebrow. Jaster couldn't help but stare at his ad himself.Kryze blinked at him for a moment, but recovered quickly. ""That is quite an accusation. I thought the Republic's soldiers were...""""Organic droids?"" Cody offered tentatively. They had all encouraged him to speak up if he felt it right, but Jaster could see just how hard this was for him.Kryze glanced at him. ""Something like that.""""No, ma'am."" Cody sounded more confident now. ""We are sentient beings who have no choice in our lives.""She stared at him for a moment before turning back to Jaster. ""So, you are not here to rally the old clans and take over?""""I won't lie to you."" Jaster crossed his arms. ""I think you are doing a horrible job of running Mandalore.""Kryze crossed her arms as well. ""Not one to mince words, are you?""""However,"" Jaster continued, ""I need your help. And, from what I can tell, you need mine as well.""""Why would I need your help.""""Death Watch."" Kryze stiffened a little. ""You haven't been able to do anything about them. I've fought their kind all my life. I'll be able to quickly put an end to Pre Vizsla. Especially if you allow me to call upon the old clans. They'll rally to me if they know I'm back.""""And then they'll want you to take over as Mand'alor. No.""""Satine..."" Kenobi took a breath. ""If that is the case...if that is what the majority of your people want...""He grew quiet at a glare from the duchess, but Jaster could tell his words bothered her.She turned back to Jaster. ""And what exactly to you need from me?""""I need you to acknowledge the clones as sentient beings and Mandalorian citizens once Jango and I finish adopting them.""Her eyes widened at that. ""You're going to adopt...millions of soldiers?""""We've already started."" Jango shifted so Parjii and Skip were more visible. ""You've already met Boba. These two are Parjii and Skip. And this is Cody."" He clapped Cody on the shoulder.""Duchess..."" Skip dipped his head sheepishly.""I've adopted these four as well as Cody's vod'ika Rex,"" Jango explained. ""Commanding officers are intending to adopt some of their men as well.""""And I have adopted two as well,"" Jaster said. ""They are all now part of House Mereel.""She didn't seem to know what to make of that and just stared at him for several moments. Then, to Jaster's immense shock, she turned to Cody.""And what exactly is it you want?""Cody swallowed, nerves showing again.""Aren't you all soldiers?"" She continued. ""Isn't your loyalty to the Republic?""""That...is what we were raised to believe,"" Cody said slowly. ""And it's all any of us have known. But...there are many who've started to wonder why we're fighting this war.""""And there's a lot of us who are tired of fighting,"" Parjii jumped in.Kryze glanced at him. ""You seem awful young to be fighting.""""And he's younger than he looks."" There was a little bite to Cody's words now. ""We age at twice the rate of normal humans. I'm from one of the oldest groups of clones, and I'm only eleven. I have millions of vod'ike across the galaxy, and I'm tired of watching them die.""Kryze looked thoughtful for a moment before turning back to Jaster. ""Let me see if I understand this. You want me to recognize your adopted ade as Mandalorian citizens. In exchange, you will help me put an end to Death Watch.""""That's about it."" Jaster nodded.""And once we have both fulfilled our duties, what is to keep you from rallying the clans and taking over?""""Nothing."" He crossed his arms.She looked annoyed, but remained calm. ""So you don't deny you intend to take over as Mand'alor.""""I have no plans past saving my grandsons. And you shouldn't have any past stopping the terrorist threat. A temporary alliance can solve both our problems. After that, well, I guess we'll have to figure it out from there.""Kryze met his eye in a steady gaze. ""I see.""""I don't think you do.""""Oh, I can read between words.""Jaster gritted his teeth. While he hadn't come here wanting to take over, he was very disappointed with the current state of Mandalore. And while Kryze's heart might be in the right place, he worried she was leading their people to their own destruction. But could he really do any better? Evidently, he'd failed once. Who was to say that wouldn't happen again?""Might I make a suggestion?"" Cody asked.""Go on Cody,"" Jango said.Cody paused for a moment before continuing. ""I can read between the words as well. Each of you truly believes you'd do a better job at leading Mandalore. Working together like this could be beneficial for both of you.""Jaster sighed. He knew that's what Kenobi hoped for. But he still had his doubts.""However,"" Cody continued, ""from what I'm hearing, you both would be caught in a power struggle.""""What do you purpose?"" Kenobi asked.""Let the people choose,"" Cody said. ""Have an election. But you would both have to be in agreement first. Whoever your people choose would lead the people, but the other could still be involved in politics and offer advice.""Jaster paused in consideration. It wasn't a terrible idea. Kryze was quiet as well, looking contemplative.""Why should I agree to this?"" she said at last. ""I don't stand to gain anything.""Cody watched her for a moment as if weighing his words. ""I think you have a lot to gain. If you won, you could be more confident in yourself and what the people want from you. And if you lose..."" He shrugged. ""Isn't it better for Mandalore if the people have a leader they can trust?""She stared at him for a moment and Jaster couldn't tell what she was thinking.""I suppose you make a good argument."" She met Jaster's eye. ""Very well. I will agree to these terms, as long as you are willing to do the same.""""I am."" Jaster nodded. ""All I want is the best for Mandalore.""""As do I."" She met his gaze a moment longer before sighing. ""Regardless of the outcome, I will make sure your aliit are granted citizenship.""""And I'll see about tracking down Viszla and Kyr'tsad."" Jaster paused for a moment before smiling. ""Thank you, Duchess Kryze, for helping my family.""She looked a little surprised, but nodded anyway. ""And thank you for your help as well.""While he still had great misgivings, Jaster felt this was as good as things could have gone. He hadn't meant to get into politics, but now it was up to the people. They'd chose their own leader, whether that be Mand'alor Mereel or Duchess Kryze. He'd respect their decision either way. He only hoped the Duchess would as well.




Notes:

I'm back! Still don't know how happy I am with this chapter but I'm tired of mulling it over. Hopefully nobody's too OOC. Also, Cody's taking over the negotiations was totally inspired by the last episode of the Bad Batch!I'm hoping to move away from politics and start focusing more on Jango's and Jaster's relationships with the clones now. But this story has been giving me some trouble lately, so I might not be updating very regularly for a while.Mando'a Translations:Bu'ad: grandsonBuir: fatherAde: sonsVode: brothersAd: sonMand'alor: sole rulerVod'ika: little brotherVod'ike: little brothersAliit: clan; familyKyr'tsad: Death Watch

Chapter Text
Rex quickly answered when Cody's call came through. His eyes widened when he saw Fett was there as well.""What?"" Fett offered a nervous smile when Rex just stared at him. ""Can't a buir check on his ad?""Rex felt a fluttering in his stomach. It still felt strange to have a buir, but good as well.""I...yeah, of course."" He didn't mean to sound so stiff, but he just didn't quite know how to act around Fett.Fett's smile faltered a little. ""Rex, I know we're all still getting used to this. But I do care for you. And I...I'm trying to be the best buir I can.""Rex nodded. ""I know. I'm just...well...guess I'm trying to figure out how to be a...a son.""""Well, we'll have to learn together."" Fett's grin suddenly reminded Rex of just how young Fett was, physically even younger than Rex himself. He'd better not think about that too much, or he'd get a headache.""So."" Rex glanced at Cody. ""What happened?""He was pleasantly surprised by the end results of the mission to Mandalore. They would be accepted as Mandalorian citizens whether the duchess remained in power or if Mereel took over. Part of him felt guilty. They were, basically, betraying the Republic. But he had to do this. For his vode. For his ade.Once they finished reporting what happened on Mandalore, Fett excused himself. ""I'm sorry but Buir wants to start working on a plan to deal with Death Watch. And we have a lot of adoptions to do.""Rex smiled. ""This is really happening, isn't it?""""It is ad'ika.""Rex could only stare at him for a moment. He wasn't sure he'd ever get used to that affectionate term. Still, he liked it. Despite his unease, he wanted this to work. He wanted Fett to be his buir.""Thank you Buir.""Fett nodded with a smile before disappearing from the hologram.Cody smiled at Rex. ""I think he's a good buir. Young and unsure of himself, but he's trying his best.""""It just feels so weird.""""Tell me about it."" Cody sighed. ""I try to call him Buir, but it's hard to remember.""""Definitely."" Rex nodded. ""Any of your men ask you to adopt them yet?""""Wooly and Vine have."" Cody smiled. ""I did it right before we left for Mandalore.""""Hard to get used to, isn't it?"" Rex said. ""I just can't look at Fives and Echo the same anymore.""They grew quiet for a few moments, minds turning over all the changes in their lives.""So, what's next for us?"" Rex broke the silence.Cody sighed. ""Not entirely sure. We're still on Mandalore. General Kenobi's stuck around, but the 212th only has a couple more days of leave. I'm...not entirely sure what his plan is.""""How long before..."" Rex wasn't exactly sure what he was asking, but Cody seemed to understand.""Honestly, I think things are going to start moving quickly now. Kryze will formally announce our status as Mandalorian citizens once Fett and Mereel have formally adopted enough of us.""""How's that going to work?""""I've gotten them a list of the clones who responded to our survey and wanted to be adopted by Fett or Mereel. They're going to take holos of themselves saying the adoption vow for them. Just in case anyone questions it.""Rex frowned. ""Do we actually believe this will make a difference in the Senate?""""Oh, it will make a difference."" Cody grinned. ""As a neutral system, Mandalore has a right to grant citizenship to anyone. The Senate won't be able to do anything about it without admitting that they own us, and then they'll have the problem of enslaving sentients. Because once we're officially Mandalorians, the Senate will have no choice but to admit that we're sentient.""""I still don't know if it'll be enough.""""I doubt they'll give up without a fight,"" Cody said. ""We are a free army after all. But I do believe this will eventually win us our freedom, one way or another.""""I hope you're right."" Rex was quiet for a moment. ""How much has Kenobi told Skywalker about all this?""""I don't know. I don't think he's told him much."" Cody tilted his head. ""Honestly, I don't know how much Skywalker should know. He's awful close to the chancellor.""""Well, he is the Jedi who first found Fett and Mereel."" Rex had been wishing his general was in the loop for a while now. ""I...I really want to talk to him about this. And Commander Tano too. They care for their men.""Cody considered for a moment before sighing. ""I don't like it...but I trust your judgement vod'ika. Tell them what you feel is right. We can take care of the rest later.""Rex smiled. ""Thanks ori'vod.""They ended the call shortly after that and Rex headed off to find the General, nerves rising despite how he'd just reassured Cody. The General had proved himself multiple times in battle and saved Rex's life on more than one occasion. Still, he could be reckless at times. And Cody wasn't wrong about him being close to the Chancellor.But Rex trusted him. And while his loyalty to the Republic was crumbling, he still felt a sense of duty to his General.""Rex!"" Fives ran up from behind to fall into step next to him as he walked down the hall. ""How'd it go?""""Better than we expected, to be honest."" Rex smiled. ""And that's Buir to you ad'ika.""Fives blushed and dropped his eyes. ""Right...Buir..."" He laughed a little. ""It just...feels so strange. Good, but strange.""""Tell me about it."" Rex sighed. ""Where's Echo?""""Medbay.""""Is he okay?""""Relax Buir, he's fine. Just sprained his ankle in the last battle. Kix wants to make sure it heals well.""Rex nodded slowly. His vode were in the medbay all the time. So why did this feel different?""Anyway."" Fives raised a data pad. ""I thought I'd better get him the reg manuals. Keep him from getting bored.""Rex smiled. ""I'll check on him later. Don't cause the medics too much trouble.""""Will do Buir!"" Fives grinned as he took a different hall.Rex stared after him for a moment, lost in thought. Why was he so worried? Was it because Echo and Fives weren't just troopers, weren't even just his vode anymore? Because they were his sons? But no, that wasn't it. He loved his brothers just as much as his ade, if in a different way. No, it was because they were all so close now. So close to escaping the death and grief they'd lived all their lives. To lose one of his men now...He shook himself out of his thoughts and continued to the bridge where he found General Skywalker and Commander Tano deep in conversation. They both glanced up as he came in, and Rex suspected he knew what the topic of their discussion had been.""Hi Rex."" Ahsoka glanced at Skywalker for a moment. ""We were just talking about...well, our time-travelling visitors.""Rex nodded. ""Actually, I was hoping to talk to you both about them.""""Sure."" Skywalker smiled. ""Let's go somewhere more private.""Skywalker led them to a small meeting room, and they sat down at a table.""So."" Ahsoka watched Rex for a moment. ""What are they like?""Rex sighed. ""Not what I expected, to be honest. Certainly not what I remember from Kamino.""""I know Obi-Wan has been up to something with them, but he wouldn't tell me much,"" Skywalker said. ""Something about going to Mandalore and trying to get you guys more rights.""""Yes."" Rex paused for a moment. ""General Skywalker, I have trusted you with my life and the lives of my brothers on more than one occasion. And I just want both of you to understand what we're planning to do.""""What do you mean?"" Ahsoka asked.Rex hesitated a moment longer. ""I...I need you both to promise me no one outside this room will hear what I'm about to tell you."" He met Skywalker's eye. ""Including the chancellor.""""What?"" Rex flinched a little at the General's tone. ""Why? Chancellor Palpatine is a good man.""""Please General."" Rex forced himself to meet Skywalker's gaze. ""Promise me. Everything I say stays between us.""After a moment, Skywalker finally nodded. ""Okay Rex, I promise.""""We both do,"" Ahsoka added.Rex took a breath to calm himself before he took the plunge. ""Fett adopted me and Cody.""Skywalker's eyes widened. ""What?""""He and Mereel intend to adopt every clone, whether directly or through other clones, into House Mereel. They have just finished negotiating for our rights as Mandalorian citizens. We're...we're going to be free."" Rex's words rang in Anakin's mind. Free. But...the clones were free. It was nothing like when he was a child, enslaved with his mother. Forced to do whatever his current master wanted. Not able to leave. Not even able to be his own person. To not know what the next day would bring...when he or his mother might be taken away and never see the other again. To live in constant fear.Anakin blinked. Were the clones so different? They had no choice but to fight for the Republic. Desertion meant at least a court-martial, if not an execution. Technically, they were owned by the Republic. Millions of good men were lost every day. No clone ever knew when his brother would be ripped away from him, and they weren't even given time to properly grieve.
It's the Jedi who keep my brothers enslaved!
Slick's words came unbidden to his mind. At the time, Anakin had just thought the man was trying to cover what he did. But what if he was right? What if the Jedi had become slavers? And what of the Senate? They never did anything to make the lives of the Republic's solders better. Even the chancellor.""Skyguy?"" He blinked to find Ahsoka staring at him. ""You still with us?""""Yeah...yeah Snips."" He nodded. ""Just...thinking.""He glanced back to find Rex had a wary expression on his face. ""Sir?""""I...I'm sorry Rex. Didn't mean to ignore you. Please, continue.""""There...isn't much else to add."" Rex shrugged. ""That's our plan. I just...I wanted you to know.""""You said your brothers could be adopted through other clones,"" Ahsoka said. ""What exactly does that mean?""""Well, any clone adopted by Fett or Mereel can adopt some of their brothers if they want, and they'd all be part of Mereel's house."" Rex paused for a moment. ""I adopted Fives and Echo.""""Seriously?"" Anakin raised his eyebrows. ""What brought that on?""""They asked me."" Rex suddenly had a far-off look in his eye. ""And it just...felt right.""They were all quiet for a moment after that. Then Anakin blurted a question. ""Do you feel like you and your brothers are slaves?""Rex flinched. ""It's...more complicated than that. We were born to fight for the Republic. It was all we ever knew. We all knew we'd more than likely die for the Republic, and we were taught that was the greatest honor for a clone, the greatest thing we could do. Lay down our lives for the greater good."" Rex's voice grew slightly bitter. ""Watch our vode die day in and day out for a Republic that hardly even considers us people.""Anakin flinched this time. He knew his men were people. He felt it in the Force every day, each soldier a unique and bright spot. But he had seen how some people treated them. Up until now, he'd always thought it was the minority. But what if he was wrong?Rex was quiet for a moment longer before sighing. ""No, I've never felt like a slave. But with everything that's been happening..."" He shook his head. ""I've started to wonder...""""Rex, I..."" Anakin dropped his eyes. ""I'm so sorry.""""For what, sir?""""I...I should have seen it.""""What do you mean?"" Ahsoka asked. ""Seen what?""Anakin hesitated for a moment. He'd done everything he could to forget about his childhood on Tatooine, to shove those memories so far down they'd never be able to resurface. And he'd never told anyone unless he had to, even Ahsoka didn't know. But, suddenly, he felt a need to tell them, two people he considered close friends, the truth.""I...don't like talking about it,"" he mumbled. ""But...I was a slave as a child.""There was no sound of surprise, but it was easy to sense in the Force. Ahsoka's shock and sorrow flooded over their training bond. And Rex, even though he usually did well at hiding his feelings in the Force, had allowed surprise and confusion to leak through.Anakin forced himself to look up as he continued. ""I never saw it before, but..."" He met his captain's eye. ""How the Republic treats you...how they own you...you and your brothers are no different from how I was as a child. Slaves.""Rex's face remained neutral, but Anakin could still sense his turbulent emotions. ""Maybe...""""Rex."" Anakin got to his feet and the other two followed suit. He walked around the table so he could grasp Rex's shoulders. ""I'm sorry. And I swear, I'll do everything in my power to help free you and your brothers.""Rex's eyes widened slightly. ""I...I can't ask that of you sir. You're a Jedi. You have more important...""""Nothing is more important than my friends."" For just a moment, emotion shown in Rex's eyes, and shocked joy and gratitude permeated the Force.""And besides."" Anakin smiled as he let go of Rex. ""I always used to say I'd free all the slaves once I became a Jedi. I finally have a chance to do that.""""Me too."" Ahsoka crossed her arms. ""You and your brothers are my family Rex. And I promise, I'll do everything I can to help you.""Rex stared at them a moment longer before smiling. ""Thank you."" His voice had dropped to a whisper. ""This...this means a lot to me.""""Of course Rex."" Anakin nodded. ""Now, what can we do to help?""

Chapter Text
""Ni kyr'tayl gai sa'ad Trigger, CT-2105, Red, Siren, CT-5490...""Buir and Ba'buir's voices had been droning on from the back of the ship for nearly three hours with hardly a break. And even though Boba knew how important it was, listening to the continuous adoptions was getting a little old.""Can't they hurry up!"" Boba was waiting in the cockpit with Cody, Parjii and Skip. ""Or at least take a break.""Cody shot him an unimpressed look from his data pad. ""This has to be done Boba.""""I know."" Boba rolled his eyes. ""But you can't tell me you aren't getting sick of it.""Cody shrugged. ""I'm busy.""""With what exactly?"" Skip asked. He and Parjii seemed tired of the adoptions as well.""I'm trying to figure out how to deal with Death Watch since Fett...since Buir and Mereel are busy.""""Can I help at least?"" Boba asked.""No.""""Why not?"" Boba hated that his voice sounded whiny.Cody glanced up again. ""Don't you have anything better to do?""""I was hoping to see some of Mandalore."" Boba crossed his arms. ""But Buir won't let me go alone."" He might have even asked Kenobi to take him, but the Jedi had gone back to talk with the duchess again.""That would be nice,"" Parjii muttered. ""We really didn't get to see much, and we'll probably be leaving soon.""""Maybe Buir will take a break soon?"" Skip said hopefully.Cody sighed and put down his data pad. ""I understand this is difficult. But even when they do take a break, we have to figure out about Death Watch. I'm sorry vod'ike.""Boba groaned and collapsed in a seat.""You know,"" Skip muttered, ""I'm starting to miss fighting. At least then we wouldn't be bored.""""No, you'd probably be dead!"" Cody snapped.Everything became deathly quiet as the three younger clones stared at him.""No, I didn't mean..."" Cody closed his eyes for a moment. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.""""You're right though,"" Skip said in a quiet voice.""Still, I should never have said that."" Cody quickly walked over and sat next to Skip. ""Ni ceta vod'ika.""Skip nodded without a word.Cody sighed. ""I just don't want you to take what you have for granted. Do you know how many of our brothers would give anything for a life away from the fighting?""""I know."" Skip glanced up. ""I'm just...not used to this.""He got up and walked out of the cockpit. Parjii quickly followed him.Cody stared after them for a moment before running a hand over his face. ""I really didn't mean to sound so harsh.""Boba snorted. ""You messed that up pretty good ori'vod.""""I understand what they're getting at, I really do. But we need to get this all figured out as soon as we can. It's the only way to save our brothers.""""Our brothers,"" Boba repeated. Despite how much his buir had told him otherwise, he liked the sound of that.He knew Cody was right. Still, he really wanted to see more of Mandalore. And actually, Buir had just told him not to go alone. If Parjii and Skip went with him...""I'll talk to them."" Boba got up.Cody glanced after them. ""I don't know, I probably should...""""You said it yourself. What you're doing is important. We'll keep busy.""After a moment, Cody nodded. ""Okay then. Thanks vod'ika.""""No problem."" Boba quickly followed his vod'ike to find them sitting together on the floor, Parjii rubbing Skip's back and murmuring under his breath.""Hey."" Boba crouched next to them. ""You guys okay?""Skip shrugged, refusing to look up. He looked so young in that moment and Boba was again reminded that, though they appeared older, these two were just kids compared to him.""I...""""He's more embarrassed than anything,"" Parjii said.Skip glared at him, but didn't say anything.""Why would you be embarrassed?"" Boba asked. ""Kote shouldn't have said that to you. And he does feel bad about it.""""But he's right."" Skip pulled his knees to his chest. ""How can I want to go back to the battlefield when there's so many brothers who want out?""Boba sighed. ""You didn't mean it that way. I know you don't really want to go back. You were just joking.""""I guess so."" Skip nodded. ""But still...""""No use feeling bad about it. I know how much you love your vode."" Boba frowned. ""Far more than I ever did before now.""Skip shook his head. ""Don't think that Boba. Whatever happened in the past, we know you care for your vode now.""""I do. And so do you.""Skip blinked at him for a moment before smiling. ""Thanks.""Boba smiled. ""Now that that's settled, the three of us are going to go see some of Mandalore.""""What?"" Parjii sat up straighter. ""But...I thought Buir didn't want you to go alone.""""I'm not going alone."" Boba crossed his arms. ""I'm going with the two of you.""""I...don't think that's what he meant.""Boba shrugged. ""We're not going to see anything if we sit around here all day. Besides, it's not like we can't take care of ourselves. I was on my own for a year, and you're both soldiers. What could possibly happen?""Parjii and Skip exchanged a look.""I guess it couldn't hurt,"" Skip said slowly.""Good!"" Boba headed for the door. ""Then let's get going!""Thankfully, all the adults were so engrossed in their work that they didn't notice them sneaking out. It wasn't long before they had made their way back into Sundari. While this wasn't the part of Mandalore Boba would have chosen to explore, it was still interesting.Parjii and Skip stared at everything they passed with awe in their eyes. Boba had fun explaining things to them and answering their questions. He sometimes forgot they had only recently made it off Kamino and hadn't seen much of the galaxy. They had a lot of fun, but Boba soon decided it was time to turn back.""Hopefully nobody noticed us missing,"" he said.Parjii snorted. ""I doubt that.""""So do I."" Boba sighed. ""But we can dream.""""I feel kind of bad,"" Skip said. ""Running off like this right after Cody and I argued.""""But it's been fun too."" Parjii grinned. ""Going rouge. Never dared disobey orders before.""Boba rolled his eyes. ""It wasn't disobeying orders. It was...disobeying our aliit.""Suddenly, Boba realized the others had stopped and turned to find their eyes focused on the higher buildings.""Uh...Boba..."" Parjii suddenly sounded nervous.Boba followed his gaze and sucked in a breath. There, situated within the shadows on a roof, was someone wearing full Mandalorian armor. And their gaze was fixed on them.""Keep walking,"" Boba muttered. ""We have to get back to the ship.""""I take it they're not a friendly?"" Skip asked.""Not likely."" Boba swallowed as the others followed him. ""True Mandalorians still wear armor, but I've heard there aren't many in Sundari.""""Then...that means...""""Death Watch.""Suddenly, the air was knocked out of Boba's chest and he found himself sprawled out on the ground. He scrambled to get up, to fight back, but a strong hand ground his head into the ground. Screams erupted from around them as passersby fled the fight.""Let him go!"" His heart dropped at the sounds of a struggle. He'd hoped Skip and Parjii would get out of there. ""Boba!""When he was finally yanked to his feet, he found himself face to face with a Mandalorian woman in full armor. He snarled and tried to fight back against his captors, but they had his arms in an iron grip. Two more Mandalorians pushed Parjii and Skip forward to stand next to him.""What do you want?"" he growled.The woman just stared at him for a moment before tilting her helmet to the others. ""Take them.""He felt a prick against his neck, and the word began to dim.""No..."" he muttered even as he felt the drug taking effect. ""Parjii...Skip...""But there was nothing he could do before the darkness took him. Jango's mouth was dry. He'd lost count of how many adoptions they'd completed. Buir's voice had started to rasp some time ago. But finally, they'd decided to give it a break. He groaned as he sat down next to Cody.""You okay?"" Cody asked.Jango shrugged and took a drink of water. He really didn't want to talk if he didn't have to.""It was a good start."" Jaster sat down as well. ""How many do you think we need to do before moving forward with our plan?""Cody put his data pad down. ""I'm not sure. There are a lot of us.""""True. But we need a goal that we can reach in a reasonable amount of time,"" Jaster said.  Kenobi walked in at that moment, interrupting their conversation. His brow was furrowed as his eyes darted to each of them.""Where are Boba and the others?""""What do you mean?"" Cody got up.Kenobi shook his head. ""They're not on the ship.""""Boba!"" Jango called, getting to his feet. ""Skip! Parjii!""But there was no reply.""Oh no,"" Cody muttered.""What?"" Kenobi asked.""They were talking about wanting to see more of Mandalore.""""I told Boba not to go alone!"" Jango said.""We have to find them."" Jaster started for the door. ""I doubt our presence has gone unnoticed by Death Watch. If they find them before we do...""Jango clenched his fists. He had to find his boys.

Chapter Text
The first thing Boba noticed when he woke up was that he was cold. He was shivering, and a breeze wafted through the tent he was apparently in. His head was still a little foggy from whatever they'd given him, but it seemed to be wearing off, and his wrists were secured behind his back. Sloppily secured. That was good news at least. And he wasn't alone.""Parjii?"" He shuffled over to two still forms. ""Skip?""Their wrists were similarly secured and neither of them moved, but they were breathing. Boba just had to wait for them to wake. At least, he hoped so.In the meantime, he managed to get to his feet and crept to the tent's opening. It was dark, but he could see two Mandalorians arm wrestling at a small table just outside. Evidently, they were supposed to be guarding the prisoners. Still, Boba doubted it would do much good to attempt an escape. Even if he couldn't see far, he suspected the snow-covered camp was full of Death Watch soldiers. Besides, he had to wait for Parjii and Skip to wake before escape could even be attempted. So, he headed back into the tent and sat with his brothers, shivering.Waiting proved to be dangerous as it gave him time to think. To realize just what he'd done. He'd put his vod'ike in danger. He'd thought he could take care of them. But now they were all prisoners.""I'm sorry,"" he mumbled.""Boba?"" His heart leapt as Skip began to move. At least, he thought it was Skip. It was hard to tell in the dim light. ""Wha' h'ppn'd?""""We were attacked.""""Great..."" Parjii struggled to sit up as well.""Buir will be angry."" Skip sounded a lot clearer already.""Now what?"" Parjii asked.""We seem to be in some kind of temporary camp,"" Boba said in a hushed voice. ""Definitely not in Sundari anymore. I don't think we're even on Mandalore. We have two lazy guards, but I assume there are many more nearby.""""Doesn't matter, we'll get out."" Parjii grinned. ""You'll figure something out ori'vod.""Boba just stared at him for a moment. Sure, he'd been taking care of himself for a year. But in truth, over the past few weeks, he'd gotten used to having his buir and ori'vode to take care of him. And now...now he was the ori'vod. He was the one Parjii and Skip were looking to for answers. And while he couldn't fight back a burst of pride at the way they were looking at him, he was mostly just plain terrified. They were his responsibility. And if he let anything happen to them...""Boba?"" Skip frowned. ""What is it?""He should come up with a good answer, like Cody would. Something that would set them at ease and inspire them. But...he had no idea how to do that.""I'm sorry."" He hung his head. ""This is my fault. I shouldn't have suggested we leave the ship.""All was quiet for a moment before Boba felt a squeeze on his shoulder. He glanced up to find Parjii smiling at him.""Don't worry. We'll get out of this. We just have to work together.""Boba swallowed. ""I'm supposed to be the one comforting you, not the other way around.""Parjii sighed. ""I guess we're still figuring out just what we are to each other. You're our ori'vod. You're older than us and took care of yourself. But...there are some ways we're older than you besides just appearance.""Skip nodded. ""And that's okay. We're going to look out for each other.""""And we shouldn't have been putting so much on you. I'm sorry Boba. Ni ceta."" Parjii seemed to be testing the Mando'a, glancing at Boba as if to ask if he'd used it right.Boba smiled after a moment, nerves calming. They were right.  He'd tried to be just an ori'vod to these two, but maybe he needed to let himself be their vod'ika as well. Their ori'vod'ika, as Cody had said.""You're right. We'll figure this out together.""Parjii nodded and Skip grinned.""So..."" Boba glanced between the two of them. ""Any ideas?""""Well, they probably underestimated you,"" Skip said. ""Most people don't think a kid could be dangerous.""""Maybe."" Boba nodded slowly. ""But I think they might underestimate you as well.""Parjii's brow pinched. ""What do you mean?""""I doubt Death Watch would consider clones to be worthy adversaries."" Boba flinched. ""No offence.""""None taken."" Skip tilted his head. ""I see where you're going, but I don't know if we can do much. Not like we have that much experience.""""We hardly even made it out of our first battle."" Parjii frowned. ""If they'd attacked someone like Captain Rex or Commander Cody, those thugs wouldn't have stood a chance.""""But you've trained to fight your whole lives,"" Boba insisted. ""You can take them.""""They certainly didn't overdo it on the restraints."" Skip's face twisted in concentration for a moment, then his eyes widened. ""Wow. I'm already free!""Parjii glanced at Boba as Skip helped with his bound wrists. ""Why did they take us anyway?""Boba sighed. ""Probably because of what Buir and Ba'buir are trying to do.""""We're leverage."" Skip finished with Parjii and quickly got to work on Boba's restraints.""Exactly."" Boba tilted his head. ""Hopefully, we can attempt to escape before their plans are set in motion.""""Better do more than attempt,"" Skip muttered. ""After the first try, they'll be ready for us.""Parjii quietly glanced out of the tent at their guards. ""I...might have an idea.""He quickly returned to them. ""If we can take those two by surprise, then Skip and I can steal their armor. Looks like it would fit.""""Well, that might help us,"" Skip said. ""But what about Boba?""""Maybe you could take me somewhere?"" Boba suggested.""That would look suspicious unless we were ordered to."" Parjii frowned.Boba thought for a moment. ""Then wait until you are ordered to.""""What?""""Look, I want to know just what's going on here. It might help with Ba'buir's plans. Maybe someone will ask to speak with me, and I can see what I can find out. And if we were able to take some prisoners...""""Woah! Slow down Boba."" Skip held up his hand. ""I think you might be getting a little carried away.""""At least with the prisoners part."" Parjii looked thoughtful. ""But...he has a point about waiting until we're told to bring him somewhere.""""It's the only way we won't raise suspicion."" Boba crossed his arms. ""And I want to get information. I'll admit, taking prisoners probably won't happen at the moment. But any information we get could be helpful.""Parjii and Skip exchanged a glance before Parjii sighed. ""I suppose you're right.""""Good."" Boba nodded. ""We'll have to be fast. Take the guards out, get you two into their armor, and get you back outside before anyone notices they're missing.""""What if they don't come for you before guards change?"" Skip asked.""Then we'll take the new guards out, make a run for it, and hope for the best.""Skip crossed his arms. ""And what if they ask for all of us instead of just you?""Boba considered for a moment, but Parjii spoke up first. ""We tell them the other two prisoners are still unconscious. It's still dark, so the two unconscious guards could pass for us if we keep their faces down.""""Well..."" Skip sighed. ""I don't have a better plan.""""Okay then."" Parjii nodded. ""Let's do it.""The two guards proved to be very easy to deal with. Parjii and Skip each grabbed one from behind and yanked them into the tent. Boba quickly grabbed one guard's blaster, switching it to stun and shooting both of them within a few seconds. The pair crumpled to the ground and Parjii and Skip started stripping them of their armor.Soon, everything was quiet again. Both guards were left unconscious on the ground, hands bound (and a gag added for good measure). After Boba's hands had once again been bound, his vode seated themselves outside to wait. It was about an hour later when Boba heard approaching footsteps and stiffened.""He wants to speak with the boy."" It sounded like the female Mandalorian from the street.Skip walked into the tent and gently grabbed Boba's arm.""Not like that,"" Boba muttered. ""They'll expect you to treat me rough.""Skip visibly flinched, but nodded and yanked Boba out of the tent. It had grown a little lighter, but the sun had yet to chase the chill from Boba's bones and he shivered as he looked up at the Mandalorian woman. It was, indeed, the same one from before. She eyed him for a moment, helmet fixed in his direction, before turning and striding away. Parjii and Skip pulled Boba after her as two new guards sat down outside the tent.They made their way across the camp and the woman ducked into another tent. But Skip and Parjii paused. It took only a moment for Boba to figure out why. If they were to attempt an escape, now would be the time. Boba considered it for a moment. What if he put his vod'ike in more danger?Parjii squeezed Boba's arm and he heard a faint whisper. ""We're with you ori'vod.""They had to do this. They had to try. Boba let out a long breath and ducked into the tent.

Chapter Text

Cody wasn't sure what to do or where to start searching. His general suggested he might be able to find Boba, Parjii and Skip through the Force, so had gone off to meditate. Still, that left Cody with nothing to do but pace. To his great frustration, Jango...Buir had gotten the same idea and they kept running into each other.
""Will you both sit down!"" Mereel said. ""You're not helping.""
""There has to be something we can do!"" Jango said. ""Kenobi might not be able to find them.""
""But he might,"" Cody said in a quiet voice. ""I've seen him do it before. Locate missing troopers, even shinies he hardly knew.""
He was quiet for a moment before he sighed. ""This is my fault.""
""I doubt that,"" Mereel said.
""But it is."" Cody glanced at Mereel. ""The three of them were bored and I ignored them. I should've known something like this would happen.""
""It still isn't your fault."" Jango met Cody's eyes. ""They're all old enough to know better.""
Cody swallowed. ""I feel like I'm letting Rex down. He thought Parjii and Skip would be safe.""
""If anyone's letting him down, it's me,"" Jango said firmly. ""I'm their buir, and yours.""
Cody was saved from replying when General Kenobi walked in a moment later.
""Did you find them?"" Jango asked.
""Not...exactly.""
""What do you mean?"" Cody asked.
Kenobi sighed. ""I couldn't sense their presences, but I had a brief vision. A snow-covered camp.""
Cody's heart dropped.
""They're not here,"" Jango said slowly.
Kenobi shook his head. ""I'm...not entirely sure where they are.""
Mereel let out a long breath. ""Well, I guess Death Watch knows we're back.""
""What will they do to them?"" Jango asked, panic in his voice.
""I don't know,"" Kenobi said. ""But we'll find them.""
""General..."" Cody hesitated for a moment. He really didn't want to mention it, but he still needed to protect his vode in the 212th. ""I...hate to point it out, but the 212th is supposed to return to the war tomorrow. We can't just abandon them either.""
""True."" Kenobi nodded slowly. ""I believe I can call in a few favors and get the 212th a few extra days of leave. How many adoptions have been completed?""
Mereel glanced at his data pad. ""Nearly 15,000."" He blinked. ""Wow. I didn't realize we'd gotten that far.""
""Do you think that's enough that we could move our plan forward?""
Cody's eyes widened.
""It's a significant number that couldn't be ignored,"" Mereel said. ""I think we could go ahead. We tried to spread it out, adopting some from every battalion.""
""What does this have to do with rescuing my ade!"" Jango snapped.
""Because we can't abandon my vode either!"" Cody glanced at Kenobi. ""You want to move forward with the plan? But how, if we're going after the kids?""
""You said Rex was going to explain all this to Anakin, right?""
Cody nodded.
""Okay then. We'll have to let Satine know that we're ready early. I am sure there will be an immediate response from the Republic. If you all feel comfortable with it, I'll contact Anakin and Plo Koon and let them know what's going on. They both know the basics anyway. That way, they'll be able to take care of troopers and coordinate getting them out of the fighting.""
""Just the two of them?"" Cody asked.
""While the Senate as a whole won't be in our favor, I believe there will be some senators who will be willing to help as well. Maybe even some other Jedi."" Kenobi paused for a moment before sighing. ""Honestly Cody, I'm not sure what will happen. The Senate could fight back pretty hard, and I'm certain the Kaminoans will. All I want is for Anakin and Master Koon to be there to provide support for your vode. Then we'll just have to trust the Force and let things play out as they will.""
Jango stared at him for a moment before shaking his head. ""You're sure putting a lot of trust in the Force.""
""Nothing I haven't done before.""
There was a time when Cody would've scoffed at putting his trust in something so intangible, but he'd seen enough strange things to know the Force was real. Hopefully, it cared for his brothers enough to help them now.
""It's sooner than we'd planned,"" Mereel said. ""You think Kryze will be okay with that?""
""I believe so. Especially since we now have a lead on Death Watch.""
""Not much of a lead,"" Cody mumbled. ""There are a lot of snowy planets in the galaxy.""
""Besides, the four of us can't take down all of Death Watch alone,"" Jango said.
Mereel sighed. ""Maybe I can rally the old clans, get any remaining Haat Mando'ade to help. While Kryze was initially against it, not contacting them was never part of our arrangement.""
""I believe it's a good idea."" Kenobi nodded. ""As long as you don't call on them to march on Sundari, there shouldn't be a problem.""
Cody glanced at Mereel. ""I believe I know who we should contact first.""
""Who?""
""Kal Skirata.""
 
Boba glared at the man before him with all the fury he could muster.
""So."" The Mandalorian removed his helmet. ""This is the 'son' of Jango Fett.""
""Yes."" He ignored the jab. ""And who are you?""
""Of course, where are my manners?"" The man mock bowed. ""Pre Vizsla, of House Vizsla.""
Boba took a moment to think about that.
""I've heard of you,"" Boba muttered. ""Your House was responsible for the death of Jaster Mereel.""
""So we thought."" Vizsla crossed his arms. ""But it would seem not, considering he's back. And stooping so low as to make a deal with the spineless Duchess Kryze and her New Mandalorians.""
Ah. So they did know that much.
""Anyway, I have some questions for you."" Vizsla crossed his arms. ""What are Mereel and Fett really planning?""
""If you're asking how they're going to find you, I have no idea. But I know they will, especially since you took us captive.""
""Oh, I'm not worried about that. No, I want to know what their real angle is. They can't be doing all this just to save the meatdroids.""
Boba bristled and might have attacked Vizsla had Parjii and Skip not still had a hold on him. He'd heard the clones called that before, but things were different now.
""Do not insult my vode,"" he growled.
Vizsla narrowed his eyes. ""Your kind have no right to our language.""
""Our kind? Our blood is quite literally the same as a former Mand'alor's. I'd say we have a right.""
Vizsla's eyes flashed. ""Fett was no Mand'alor, and neither was Mereel."" In a single motion, he grabbed a hilt off his back and activated a humming black sword. ""Neither one has ever wielded this blade, so cannot lay claim to rule Mandalore.""
Boba could only stare at it. The Darksaber. He'd thought that weapon had been long lost. But if Vizsla had the Darksaber...that could present a complication to their plans. He didn't know how many Mandalorians might be swayed by this development. He hoped they wouldn't, but he couldn't be sure.
He must have taken too long to respond. ""I see you know what this is."" Vizsla leveled the blade at Boba's neck. ""And what it means.""
""I know the stories.""
""Good. Now, I ask you again. What are Fett and Mereel's true plans?""
Boba met his eyes, but didn't say a word.
Vizsla made a frustrated sound. ""This is getting us nowhere."" He deactivated the Darksaber and put it away. ""Bring in the meatdroids. Maybe they'll be more helpful.""
""No."" Boba tilted his head. ""I think it's time we left.""
Parjii and Skip let go of Boba to simultaneously shoot stun blasts at Vizsla. He slumped down without a fuss. Boba wished they'd just killed him, but he supposed the shots would've drawn too much attention. Almost everyone in the room had been stunned before they had a chance to react. Boba noticed the woman who'd led them there reaching for a blaster, but threw himself at her before she could get it out.
She let out a snarl and they were soon tusseling on the floor. After a couple minutes, Boba managed to get on top of her, but she kicked him off and started scrambling for her blaster. Boba tried to kick it away, but she grabbed it first. A shot whizzed past his ear, far too close for comfort, right before Parjii stunned her and she slumped to the ground with the others.
""Let's go!"" Skip hissed. ""Someone will have heard the blaster fire.""
Boba paused for a split-second, wanting to either capture or finish off Vizsla. Or maybe grab the Darksaber. But Parjii grabbed his arm and yanked him outside. And none too soon. Shouts were erupting from around the camp as they ran.
""There!"" Parjii pulled him toward where several Gauntlet starfighters stood waiting.
The three of them ran. Parjii and Skip were firing back at the approaching Mandalorians and even managed to take a couple down. They were nearly to the ship when Skip let out a cry and collapsed.
Boba didn't hesitate. He grabbed Skip's blaster and started firing while Parjii helped their brother up.
""Come on!"" Parjii called.
Boba fired a few more times before darting onto the ship and closing the ramp behind him.
""Take care of Skip! I'll get us in the air.""
He quickly made his way to the cockpit and fired up the small fighter. He'd never been in a Guantlet fighter before, but the controls were easy enough to figure out. Still, by the time they were in the air, blaster fire was whizzing past them.
""Come on, come on, come on..."" Boba muttered as he directed the fighter over the trees. He had just started to think he was in the clear when an explosion rocked the ship and the indicator lights started flashing at him.
Boba grit his teeth. Several critical systems were damaged. They weren't getting off the planet. Possibly away from Death Watch, but not the planet. He was already losing control as they careened toward the planet's mountains.
Only one thing to do now. Boba quickly activated the comm system and punched in the right frequency.
""I'm sorry buir!"" he began. ""Death Watch captured us. We stole a ship, but it's damaged and we're crashing in the mountains. Sending you the coordinates now.""
He pressed the right buttons and glanced up to see the mountains fast approaching. The ship was almost impossible to maneuver, but he'd have to try.
""You should know, Pre Vizsla has the Darksaber.""
The proximity alert started going off as Boba tried to maneuver them to land on a cliff.
""Got to go. Hopefully we'll see you soon.""
He braced himself, hoping he was as good a pilot as he thought he was.





Notes:

I don't think Kal Skirata was ever confirmed as part of the True Mandalorians, but it seems to be implied and he was at least familiar with many of them. Between that and how he cared for the clones, it seems like he's a good contact to begin with.Happy Mandalorian Season 3 day!!! Haven't gotten a chance to watch yet, but I'm super excited for it along with more Bad Batch tonight!Mando'a TranslationsBuir: fatherVode: brothersAde: childrenHaat Mando'ade: True MandaloriansMand'alor: sole rulerBa'buir: grandfather

Chapter Text
Obi-Wan tensed as he entered the palace at Sundari. He had agreed to alert Satine of what had happened while the others attempted to contact Skirata. Though he hoped Satine would agree to speeding things up, he wasn't sure. So far, she'd been surprisingly willing to work with Fett and Mereel, but Obi-Wan couldn't help but wonder how long that would last. He knew just how stubborn she could be.""Back so soon?"" Satine asked as he approached. ""I thought you were returning to Coruscant.""""There has been a development."" Obi-Wan came to a stop before her. ""Death Watch has kidnapped Boba, Parjii and Skip.""Satine's eyes narrowed. ""So Fett and Mereel are incapable of protecting even their own. How do they expect to protect the entire planet?""""None of us expected Death Watch to make a move so soon. Of course, it didn't help that the boys wandered off on their own.""She watched him a moment longer. ""And what does that mean you need from me?""""We'll have to make a move on Death Watch sooner than anticipated. But we also need the clones so be announced as Mandalorian citizens within the next few days.""Satine's eyes widened. ""The deal was I would make the announcement after Mereel dealt with Death Watch. Why does this change things?""""I had been hoping to return to Coruscant and see if I could drum up some sympathy for the clones as well as look after my men during the transition. But now, I'm going with to make sure the boys come back alive. I cannot allow my men to go to battle without me. They need their freedom now, all the clones.""They remained quiet for a moment before Satine stood. Obi-Wan sensed her indecision in the Force, but he couldn't tell what it was about. He hoped she wasn't considering backing out now.""Obi-Wan."" She finally turned to face him. ""I've known you for a long time. Why are you willing to abandon your government and your Order for two men misplaced in time?""""You misunderstand."" He chose his words carefully. ""I'm not doing this for Fett and Mereel. I'm doing it for my men, and I'm doing it because it's what the Force wants.""He was quiet for a moment, realizing what she was really asking. Why was he willing to go against the Order for this when he hadn't for her?""This is something I have to do,"" he said at last. ""It's going to save millions of lives.""She tilted her head. ""These clones, they really are sentient?""""Of course they are!"" Obi-Wan couldn't believe she'd thought otherwise. ""They are men with hopes and dreams and fears just as any others. They may have been created for war, but they deserve so much more.""She just stared at him for a moment before sighing.""Why did you agree to Mereel's offer in the first place?"" Obi-Wan asked. ""You obviously don't believe in any of this.""""I don't really know."" Satine looked away. ""I thought I could save Mandalore from war and violence, make it better. But it just seems to be getting worse despite all I've done. What your commander suggested made sense. I don't believe it is best for Mandalore to return to the ways of the past. But I know I'm losing the support of the people. If they believe that Mereel can save our world...""Obi-Wan watched her for a moment. ""But you agreed to help the clones either way. Why?""She blinked. ""Those two...they just looked so young...so innocent.""""Parjii and Skip?""She nodded. ""I claim to be a pacifist. I claim to abhor violence. So how can I condone these men being forced to fight against their will? Before, I hadn't thought they were sentient beings. They always just stood around in their armor looking like perfect soldiers. But after actually talking to some of them..."" Satine sighed. ""Very well. I still need a little time, but I'll make the announcement in two or three days.""""You will?""Satine smiled. ""It's good to see I can still surprise you.""""Thank you Satine."" Obi-Wan nodded. ""We're forming a plan to find Death Watch. If all goes well, Pre Vizsla will be in our custody soon.""""I hope so. For all our sakes."" Jango was anxious about contacting Skirata. Kenobi had gone to discuss the new developments with Kryze, but Jango and Jaster were waiting as Cody tried to contact the Mandalorian trainer.""How well do you actually know Skirata?"" Jaster asked.""Mostly by reputation. I used to see him from time to time on Kamino, but he mostly worked with the Nulls and Commandos. But I know he was loyal to you, and he cares for my vode.""Jango vaguely remembered meeting the man a couple times, and yet it sounded like they'd known each other pretty well. It was taking longer to reach him than they'd expected. Cody was using official GAR communication channels, but evidently Skirata was difficult to track down. It was almost an hour before a holo of a man wearing Mandalorian armor sans helmet appeared.""Commander Cody."" He nodded at Cody, him being the only one currently in range of the holoprojector. ""I hear you wanted to talk.""""Yes, sir."" Cody's eyes darted to Jango then back to Skirata. ""Sir, this is not official GAR business.""Skirata's brow wrinkled. ""Okay.""""And it might sound a little...insane. It's Force-related.""Skirata looked to be fighting not to roll his eyes. ""Of course.""Cody's eyes darted to Jango once more and Skirata sighed. ""Come on son. Spit it out. I don't have all day.""""Well...it might be better to just show you."" Cody stepped back, gesturing Jango forward. He swallowed, but raised his head and walked forward, followed closely by Jaster.Skirata stared at them for a moment, eyes betraying no emotion. He seemed to be sizing them up.""Kal Skirata."" Jaster nodded.Skirata stared for a moment longer. ""Jaster Mereel,"" he said at last. ""You're dead.""""As I have been told.""Skirata's eyes then darted to Jango. He stared at him for a long moment as if working out a puzzle. ""Jango?""""Lek.""Skirata's gaze darted to the side, looking worried. Jango wondered if some of his clone sons were there.""This is all very confusing,"" Jaster said. ""But, suffice it to say, Boba accidentally brought the two of us here from the past.""Skirata stared for a moment longer before his eyes widened. ""Mand'alor.""Jaster smiled. ""It's good to see there's still some loyalty among the Haat Mando'ade.""""We were all loyal."" Fire burned in Skirata's eyes. ""Montross was the only one who wasn't.""""What?"" Jaster's eyes widened. ""I...I'd heard I was betrayed. But Montross?""Skirata sighed. ""I wasn't there, Mand'alor. But I heard later.""""Buir."" Jango grabbed Jaster's arm. ""I know this is hard to accept, but let's not forget why we're here.""Jaster shook his head. ""Right.""""And why are you here?"" Skirata turned to Jango. ""Why are you coming to me?""""Cody suggested it.""Skirata's gaze hardened. ""It's not like you to take the advice of a clone.""""I'm not him!"" Jango clenched his fists. ""I'm not the Jango you knew. He treated them horribly, they've told me. But I'm trying to fix it. Or at least, make up for what he did.""Skirata seemed taken aback for a moment before he laughed. ""You're definitely not him. Much younger and possibly even more hotheaded.""""Please."" Jango met the other man's eye. ""We need your help. Kyr'tsad has taken my ade.""""Your ade?""Jango nodded. ""I adopted several of the clones. Boba, and two others have been taken.""""By Vizsla?""""I assume."" Jaster crossed his arms. ""We need more numbers if we're going to help them. The four of us aren't enough.""""Four?""""Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi has been helping us. We're currently on Mandalore.""""We've been negotiating with Duchess Satine,"" Jango added. ""She's agreed to an election.""""You're kidding, right?""Jaster shook his head. ""After we have eliminated Death Watch, the people will choose whether to keep her as Duchess, or for me to take over as Mand'alor.""Skirata seemed at a loss of words, but there was joy gleaming in his eyes.""Either way, she also agreed to grant Mandalorian citizenship to any clones Jaster and I adopt,"" Jango continued. ""We're working on the whole army.""Skirata stared at them a moment longer before laughing. ""And everyone thought I was crazy."" Then he grew serious again. ""Would this be extended to clones other Mandalorians adopt as well?""""I don't see why not,"" Jaster shrugged. Skirata's eyes darted to someone on his end, a smile on his lips. After a moment, he nodded and turned back to them.""I don't know where to find Death Watch. What I can do is send word to the Cuy'val Dar I know are loyal to you. And I can have Jaing and Prudii see about tracking down your boys.""""That...might not be necessary.""Jango glanced at Cody. ""What do you mean?""Cody glanced up from the comms. ""We're receiving a transmission. Audio only."" He activated it.I'm sorry Buir!Jango's heart leapt. ""Boba.""
Death Watch captured us. We stole a ship, but it’s damaged and we're crashing in the mountains. Sending you the coordinates now.
There was a pause.You should know, Pre Vizsla has the Darksaber.  Got to go. Hopefully, we'll see you soon.They were all quiet for a moment after that.""Did we get the coordinates?"" Jaster asked.""Yes."" Cody glanced up. ""Carlac.""For the first time since his boys had been taken, Jango felt a surge of hope. They had a destination. Now they just had to find them.""Let's get going.""""Hold on."" Skirata held up a hand. ""There is more to this than just your lads. We need to capture or kill Pre Vizsla as well.""Jaster sighed. ""He's right. That was part of our deal with Kryze, after all. And if he has the Darksaber...""""But...we can't just abandon them!""""We won't."" Skirata crossed his arms. ""But the both of you need to lead the Haat Mando'ade in taking Vizsla. And you'll have to be quick, while we still have the element of surprise. We can either go after your boys once the threat is eliminated, or we can split up. Either way, you both need to be there to face Vizsla.""""We'll figure it out on the way,"" Jaster said.""I'll gather what Haat Mando'ade I can and meet you on Carlac."" Skirata said. ""Thank you.""Skirata nodded and the call ended.""I sure hope this works,"" Jango muttered.""Me too ad'ika."" Jaster sighed. ""Me too."" Cody felt a rush of relief when General Kenobi returned.""Well?"" Jango asked.Kenobi nodded. ""She agreed. You?""""Skirata's gathering those he can and meeting us on Carlac.""""Carlac?""""Boba managed to get a message out."" Cody couldn't fight back a proud smile. That was his vod'ika, resourceful as ever.""Good,"" Kenobi said. ""Now we just need to contact Anakin and Plo.""""We'll do it on the way."" Mereel was already prepping the ship.Once they were in hyperspace, Kenobi and Cody stepped away to contact the other Jedi. To Cody's relief, both Wolffe and Rex appeared as well.""What happened?"" Rex was the first to speak.Cody met Rex's eyes. ""Death Watch took Parjii, Skip and Boba.""""What!""""But we also know where they are and are going after them,"" Kenobi said.""Those are the first two Fett adopted?"" Wolffe asked.""Yeah."" Rex nodded.""Where are you headed?"" Skywalker asked. ""We'll meet you there.""Rex's gaze snapped to Skywalker's face and Cody's eyes widened.""Sir?"" Rex asked.Skywalker sighed. ""I know how much you want to help. We're in-between missions right now, so we may as well.""""No Anakin."" Kenobi crossed his arms. ""There's something else we need you and Master Koon to do.""""What do you need?"" Koon asked. ""Did the meeting on Mandalore go well?""""Yes, and Satine is going to announce the clones' citizenships within days.""""Already?"" Rex yelped.""That was fast,"" Wolffe said.""This changed our plans,"" Kenobi said. ""We need you two on Coruscant to help deal with the fallout of this announcement, and help get as many clones away from the fighting as possible.""""Padme will help."" Skywalker crossed his arms. ""I'm sure of it.""""I'm inclined to believe Senator Chuchi and Senator Organa will also be willing to help,"" Koon said. ""Perhaps a few others as well.""""I'm leaving that up to both of you. We're headed to Carlac to capture Vizsla and get the boys back.""Rex looked ready to speak, but held his tongue. Skywalker eyed him for a moment before turning to Kenobi.""Well, is there any reason why Rex can't come help you out? I'm sure there's some others in the 501st who'd want to make sure Parjii and Skip are safe as well.""Rex glanced at him. ""Really General?""Skywalker smiled. ""I don't see why you need to bother going back to Coruscant anyway.""""Skywalker is correct."" Koon nodded. ""And having the clones fight alongside the Mand'alor would only help to secure their new status.""""True,"" Kenobi said. ""Especially if Mereel is elected to replace Satine.""""But what if there's a strong negative response on Coruscant?"" Cody asked. ""We should have brothers on the ground to help.""""The Wolfpack is on our way back for leave."" Wolffe grinned. ""Don't worry Cody, we can take care of things. I have a feeling Fox would enjoy bashing some senators as well, if things get ugly.""""Let's hope it doesn't come to that."" Kenobi held up a hand. ""We want this to be as peaceful as possible.""""No disrespect sir,"" Rex said. ""But I doubt that will happen.""""Either way, that should be our goal,"" Kenobi said. ""Make sure the people, especially senators, get a chance to actually see the clones. Talk to them. Especially the young ones. Satine told me that's why she was so willing to help.""""A good plan,"" Koon said. ""We will get started as soon as we arrive on Coruscant.""""It's decided then."" Skywalker nodded. ""Rex will go to Carlac with any of the 501st who want to help. I'll meet Master Koon on Coruscant and coordinate with the senators.""""Thank you, sir."" Rex nodded. ""This...this means a lot to me.""""That's what friends do Rex."" Skywalker squeezed his shoulder.Rex nodded and turned back to Cody. ""See you soon ori'vod.""Cody nodded and the holograms vanished. He just hoped everything was going to work out.

Chapter Text
Storming an Imperial remnant base with two Jedi had to have been one of the boldest favors anyone had ever asked of Din. Not that he would've said no to Ahsoka and Skywalker - They were his kid's people, of course he would come to their aid. He also wanted something to do that didn't risk him running into another Mandalorian on the prowl. 'Raiding Imperial outposts, currently preoccupied' seemed like a perfect and acceptable excuse to avoid Kryze, any potential challengers, and anyone who felt so moved to insist he was the Mand'alor. I am not running away from my problems, he convinced himself, I'm just helping other people with their problems. He couldn't exactly convince himself there was a difference, though. Whatever. Not his biggest concern at the moment. He skidded around a corner nearly and slipped on the pristine floor of the Imperial hallways. Before he ran into the wall, he managed to twist around and blast two of the Stormtroopers on his heels. It didn't do much good, considering at least twenty more were still chasing him, but he wasn't going to worry about that. Ahsoka and Skywalker asked for a diversion, he groaned inwardly as he pushed himself off the wall and continued to book it. He gritted his teeth at a blast door closing up ahead. I hope this is good enough. Din managed to dive through the opening just before the door closed all the way, getting one last good shot in at the Stormtrooper rounding the corner behind him. Then, their blasterfire pelted harmlessly off the other side of the door as they all caught up.He heard one yell, ""Go around! Flank him from the other hall!"" The footsteps receded, and Din took a moment to catch his breath against the door. He kept running. Klaxons started blaring as he jumped through a closing blast door. He turned a hallway, only to come face to face with at least 10 Stormtroopers. In a split second reaction, he shot three, then turned and ran back the way he came. And, of course, he found himself cornered. ""Move in!"" A Stormtrooper shouted. Back to the door, Din nailed the first two bucketheads that came around the corner. Being absolute kriffers, though, they started taking shots from behind the cover of the corner. Although Din managed to fell a few unlucky Stormtroopers, he wasn't getting anywhere with a blaster. It was like they were multiplying. Reluctantly, he sighed and holstered his blaster.For lack of a better melee weapon, he drew the Darksaber. The hum of the battle and its glow were seemingly on the same frequency. It buzzed in anticipation. This doesn't mean I like you, he thought to the saber. It didn't seem to dim in the slightest. Of course. You're a non-sentient laser-sword. Why do you care.Just as the Stormtrooper commander called to fall back, Din moved forward, Darksaber gripped and ready to mutilate some Imps.
 I hope this qualifies as a diversion.  
--
""Sir, the Mandalorian has a lightsaber, requesting backup!-"" 
The comm cut out. Ahsoka shared a look with Luke across the control center. ""Did you give him yours?"" Luke asked, raising an eyebrow. Ahsoka brushed a hand over the hilt clipped to her waist. ""No..."" She tried to think back on the Mandalorian's arsenal. She'd taken note of a blaster pistol, copious amounts of explosives, at least one knife, and various other weapons, all deemed non-threatening and completely normal for a Mandalorian to be in possession of. But was it possible...? More Stormtroopers appeared in the doorway. ""Freeze, Jedi!""""Well, we'll have to worry about that later,"" quipped Luke, the green blade of his lightsaber casting a glow on the room. Ahsoka drew her own lightsaber, illuminating the console she'd previously been rifling through in white light.--Din had made quick work with the Darksaber, and then instantly tucked it away on his belt and drawn his blaster pistol again. He continued running through the maze of hallways. The comm on his vambrace beeped. He switched his blaster to his offhand and brought the comm up to his helmet. ""Ahsoka?""""Rendezvous in the hangar. We'll be there shortly."" Her voice was loud and tinny over a medley of muffled alarms. ""Copy that,"" He said, aware of the few Stormtroopers he'd picked up. He turned around and shot them. ""Would you mind planting a few detonators on your way there?"" She added. ""Ah- Will do.""The comm beeped again and he lowered his vambrace, switching his blaster pistol back. With his free hand, he picked a charge off his belt and flicked it onto the wall. He didn't have many, but the ones he did have were tossed onto every other surface he passed. He even dropped one on the floor for the sake of it.Now, to find the hangar.
Wherever the kark that is. 
He had just started worrying about their exit plan when a vent cover in the hallway ahead rattled loose and fell to the floor. Din skidded to a halt. A pair of boots dangled from the vent momentarily before Skywalker, clad in his black robes, landed atop the vent cover in a crouch and ignited his lightsaber. ""Do you know where the hangar is?"" Din asked, too preoccupied to question the Jedi's method of travel. If he wanted to use the vents to get around, he could use the vents. Din had stopped questioning others' life choices. He sprang to his feet and pointed with the blade of his lightsaber. ""It's just down the hallway."" Din internally winced. So very close. He nodded, despite knowing full well Skywalker couldn't see him. Skywalker took off down the hall, and Din tossed his last charge into the ventilation duct before running after him.Just as they reached the hangar, the blast door had sealed shut. Din resisted the urge to curse as both he and Skywalker ran up to inspect the door. Skywalker turned to him and asked, ""Can you blow it?"" Maybe Din shouldn't have used all his charges so quickly. They could've lived without the last one in the vent duct. ""I'm out of charges,"" He said, standing away from the door. Skywalker seemed unperturbed. Without hesitation, he thrust his lightsaber through the door, the durasteel melting and molding around the blade. Din watched, mesmerized by the action, and pulled his own laser sword off his belt. He ignited it and was immediately hit by an overwhelming wave of weightlessness. The blade hummed delightedly as he mirrored Skywalker's actions, stabbing it through the door.""Where did you get a lightsaber?"" Skywalker's gaze was fixed on him, now. Din had forgotten that he hadn't told his Jedi friends that he had a laser sword, too. Another thing to bond over. ""It's called the Darksaber. I won it from Moff Gideon on the Imperial cruiser,"" Din explained. Judging by Skywalker's understanding nod, he new exactly which Imperial cruiser Din was referring to. ""You can have it if you want,"" He added, more a plea than an offer. And yeah, offering the Darksaber to a Jedi was probably not the best idea, generational rivalry notwithstanding.The Darksaber jolted violently in his grip. Evidently, it did not like it. Din had been right about that. ""I can't. It likes you."" Skywalker shook his head and inclined his chin towards the blade. Din was, suffice it to say, disturbed. Skywalker pushed his lightsaber towards the middle of the door. Din did the same. When they were nearly shoulder to shoulder, the door hissed open with a rickety-sounding thud. Immediately, they were bombarded by blasterfire. Skywalker took it like he was completely impervious to getting shot. Din had no such confidence, however, despite actually having armor. He scurried back around the corner and hooked the Darksaber onto his belt. Instead, as to his preference, he drew his blaster pistol, ignoring the saber's irate hums. From his position, he was able to hit a few Stormtroopers across the hangar that were leveling their blasters at Skywalker. The Darksaber hummed more incessantly the more he ignored it, and he continued to ignore it. Until Din sighed exasperatedly and holstered his blaster. He yanked the Darksaber off of his belt, glaring at it. It stilled in his palm. Shaking his head and cursing everything, he joined Skywalker in the doorway. --Ahsoka was in a complicated situation. In attempting to rescue a voice crying out for help, she had somehow managed to lock herself in a holding cell with two death troopers and a very hostile orange-and-white astromech. The death troopers had their blasters fixed on her and were speaking in their scrambled code, blocking the doorway. She subtly glanced around the room for exits or vents - Not panicked, merely looking for a way out. The droid behind her swiveled its head and shook its clenched claws. For a moment, she thought it might be familiar. Unlike the droid, the death troopers stood patiently in ready position, waiting for her to make the first move; Ahsoka, much like them, waited. Her place in the center of the room was not the most easily defensible, but she could handle two death troopers easily.  The astromech seemed to think it could, too, and rolled around her legs to militantly approach them. It slandered and pointed and harassed them, as if merely being in its sights wasn't threatening enough. Both death troopers readied their blasters.Well, never doubt an astromech. Ahsoka took the momentary distraction for what it was. While the death troopers fired their blasters and cursed at the droid, she ducked beneath the stairs at the entrance of the cell. The astromech pushed past the troopers and into the hallway, yelling something in its strange binary that sounded an awful lot like ""I'm free!""One of the troopers moved to give chase, but was stopped.""Where's the Jedi?"" The other one said, looking back into the room. They both stepped out of the doorway and into the room. Ahsoka pulled herself on top of the stairs and lingered in the doorway until they realized she wasn't in the shadowy corners. By the time they actually moved to do something, she was stepping out into the hallway and locking the cell door. She found the astromech around a corner nearby, pacing and muttering to itself. It stopped and rolled up to her as soon as she came down the hall. Tilting her head inquisitively, Ahsoka kneeled before it.""Who are you?"" She pondered aloud as she strived to give the droid a name. Then, the low sound of its grumbling - bwomping? - registered. Her back straightened. ""Chopper. Hera's astromech. Are your friends here? On Garel?"" Chopper rolled back and bwomped approvingly. He pulled his arms out and whirled around – He seemed to recognize her, too. The sound of approaching footsteps echoing in the hallway pulled her attention. A squad of Stormtroopers started firing from down the hall. Ahsoka stood and deflected their fire with her lightsaber, while Chopper rolled back and forth and bwomped in alarm. She used her free hand to pull down the vent cover overhead, catching Chopper's questioning bwomp. ""Go to the hangar! My friends will help you there,"" She shouted to Chopper before launching herself into the ventilation duct and pulling the cover up behind her. --""Uh- Skywalker! There's a droid! It has blasters!"" The Mandalorian called, sounding more concerned by the droid than anything else.Luke risked a glance behind him, where the Mandalorian was positioned at his back, and saw the well-armed astromech speeding down the hall directly towards them. Behind it, a squad of Stormtroopers came into view, firing at it and consistently missing. The droid yelled in a weird form of binary that Luke barely understood as it flew down the hall.The Mandalorian, even with both his armor, his considerable weaponry and the Darksaber, seemed intimidated. Luke couldn't focus on that right now, though, or he would get a blaster bolt in the ribs. He decided that the Mandalorian could deal with it and advanced further into the hangar.--Skywalker's lack of feedback was not comforting. Din was only more worried by the Jedi's wordless advance into the hangar. Assumedly, they meant that the droid and Stormtroopers were his problem now. He grit his teeth and held the Darksaber where it seemed to resonate the most. In other words, where it seemed the least peeved at him for earlier.However, when the droid saw him, it made an oddly positive noise, skidded to a stop, and rolled up beside him in a maneuver Din hadn't seen an astromech perform before. It said something to him that he didn't quite catch before menacingly shooting its blasters in the air and rolling towards the squad at top speed. Well, he'd take allies where he could get them. Din shook his head and followed its lead. --To Ahsoka, sneaking through ventilation shafts was just part of the job. She had had the luck of avoiding them for the most part, but practically every Jedi she'd known had their fair share of vent-duct experiences. Anakin, Ezra, Kanan, Luke - Even Obi-Wan had a few unpleasant stories. It was just part of life as a force-user.Ahead, she heard the sounds of metal ringing from blaster impact. Realizing she was finally near the hangar, she crawled faster on her knees, balanced on one hand. With her other hand, she clutched a stolen artifact to her chest, all too conscious of its whispering. It cried for her to save it. Ahsoka held it so tightly that it dug into her palm, and she promised that she would. While she and Luke had initially planned to run straight to the hangar, she had gotten sidetracked and quickly separated. Ahsoka told Luke to find the Mandalorian and promised to meet them both in the hangar as soon as possible. She had still taken the liberty of comming the Mandalorian, of course, just to add on that he should leave a little parting gift for the Imperial who owned this place. Considering what she'd stolen, she had a few guesses as to who that could be. She came upon the vent cover. Ahsoka peered through the grate and took note of what was occurring below. It, of course, was totally unsurprising. Without a moment's hesitation, she pulled her lightsaber off its hook, used it to slice open the vent cover, and threw herself into the melee. --Getting cornered in an Imperial hangar bay, being hounded by Stormtroopers, was something Din would just have to deal with. He figured his best bet was to take it in stride. This was his life now. At least he wasn't alone. Or he hadn't started off that way, but at some point, Skywalker and the droid disappeared from sight.Accepting that he'd just have to tough it out anyways, he hid behind a suspicious bin and started firing at the approaching Stormtroopers from just over the top. He had just enough time to get the sense he was being ambushed before a vent cover landed with a thud a foot from his visor. He looked up to the ceiling, only to see a form dropping from an opening about 10 meters up. Ahsoka appeared in front of him. Her lightsaber was already drawn, and she immediately started deflecting the relentless fire of the Stormtroopers. From his low vantage point, Din could see that she was holding one arm to her chest. Well, if she'd gotten injured, maybe the kid could heal her. ""Where's Luke?"" She asked firmly.""He's... somewhere around here!"" He hoped that helped. At the very least, it probably wasn't untrue. ""And Chopper?"" Assuming that Chopper was the orange-and-white astromech, Din poked his head around the corner of the bin. Still no droid anywhere.This, he was bitter about. The Jedi disappearing he could understand - He'd discovered that they were relatively flaky. The droid leaving, though? Din groaned. ""He disappeared on me, too."" ""The Stormtrooper Commander said you have a lightsaber,"" Ahsoka mused. Din let out a long-suffering sigh and poked his head over the bin just enough to shoot someone, ducking back down immediately. He knew he'd have to explain it eventually, but was now really the best time?""It's called the Darksaber,"" Din winced as a stray blaster bolt panged against the hanger wall. ""Do you know of it?""""The Darksaber..."" Her tone changed entirely. ""I thought that Bo-Katan Kryze was its last wielder. How did you acquire it?"" ""She lost it to Moff Gideon, and I defeated him,"" He explained curtly before peeking out over the bin between Ahsoka's feet. ""Do you know how to use it?"" She asked, glancing back at him.He looked up at her, a plan clicking into place in his head. Well, not a plan, more an action. A reckless one.In other words, a great idea. No need to mention that I have no idea how to use the damn thing. He nodded ever so slightly, holstering his blaster and reaching for the Darksaber instead. Ahsoka turned back to the Stormtroopers. Then, in an action that both intimidated the Stormtroopers and triggered Din's fight or flight, Ahsoka thrust a palm upwards. The lights shut off. The hangar instantly descended into darkness, save for the white glow that Ahsoka's lightsaber cast across the bins. The Stormtroopers' cries of terror were viscerally real. Taking out Stormtroopers may have been as easy for Din as skinning a gumpta, but in the dark, with a weapon he was unfamiliar with? He was not prepared for this. ""Follow my lead,"" Ahsoka said. Din couldn't see her, so he assumed that meant to watch her lightsaber and do that, too. Just as she jumped off the bin and began to skillfully mutilate some Imps, he ignited his own weapon and clambered over the container. Ahsoka made fighting with a laser sword look graceful. And although the Stormtroopers were about as defenseless as a bantha, Din had to admit, he was still struggling. Despite the coincidental weightlessness of the Darksaber, his armor and heartily practiced motions definitely didn't feel elegant. Rigid was the nicest word he could think of. At least no one could see his floundering in the darkness. For all any of the Imps knew, they were going to die. Sure enough, all the Imps were very shortly dead. The lights magically clinked back on. There was blissful silence. Aside from the humming of the damned laser swords, of course. The Darksaber hummed particularly loud until Din finally deactivated it and hung it on his belt. Ahsoka, standing at his side, hooked her lightsaber back onto her belt and looked at him, arms crossed.""It likes you,"" She said after a moment of scrutiny. Din bit back a sigh. Distantly, he wondered why it had to be him. ""Skywalker said that, too."" She tilted her head, good humor in her eyes. Then, her demeanor became serious. Searching. Din shuffled uncomfortably.She lowered her hand from her chest, fist still closed around whatever it was she was holding. He hadn't seen her bring anything in before, so his best guess was that she'd stolen it. He had no idea what the Imps had that could be worth stealing to a Jedi. Maybe a datastick, he thought. Now, face to face with her, he could see the faint red glow cast by the object. Datasticks don't do that. She opened her hand to reveal a luminescent red crystal, sitting on her palm. Cracks ran along its ridges, those cracks so dark they almost looked like veins. Scary. ""Do you know what this is?"" She asked patiently, like she was ready to explain when he inevitably got the wrong answer. He had no idea what it was, apart from the obvious. So, he guessed. ""Uh... a crystal?""Ahsoka scrutinized his visor some more. ""Yes,"" She said, looking back down at the crystal, ""It is a kyber crystal. It powers lightsabers. Oftentimes, depending on the individual who claims it, they come in shades of green and blue. I even knew a Jedi master who had a purple lightsaber. However, red crystals like this one are used by Sith. Dark Jedi.""Din tried his very hardest to absorb this knowledge. It was intriguing, and he owed it to her to listen, but he was helplessly, hopelessly, perpetually confused. Dark Jedi? Are Jedi usually light?""They are red because they bleed, so to speak. And this one was crying out to me to save it."" She pulled it back towards her own body, holding it close to her heart. So... Jedi can hear crystals. That's good to know. Why exactly do I need to know that?She looked down at the crystal with care and took a breath. ""I'm telling you this because you should know that the Darksaber has a kyber crystal as well. It is one of a kind, even more so than this one, and, through the will of the Force, made its way to you.""Din glanced back down at the inconspicuous Darksaber. It was unsettling to find out that his laser sword did, in fact, kind of possess a soul. It wasn't a complete shock, though. That was the unfortunate part.Why not, Din thought dejectedly. Suddenly, Ahsoka shifted, and Din looked up at her. Her eyes were scanning the room, littered with Imps and their various body parts. There were no apparent threats. ""Are you sure you didn't see where they went?"" Asked Ahsoka. The kyber-crystal thing now illuminated one of the pouches on her belt. Din shook his head. ""No. They-""A heavy thudding from outside the hangar had both of them reaching for their weapons before he could finish. Din drew his blaster pistol, Ahsoka brandishing her lightsaber. The thudding got closer before halting outside the door, and a mechanical whirring followed. Din shared a glance with Ahsoka. He muttered, ""Sounds like a walker.""""I think you're right,"" Was her grim reply. ""Where would they have gotten something like that?"" He grumbled. Maybe it was just his sheer, dumb unluckiness having a bearing on their situation. That had been happening a lot recently.""There used to be an Imperial manufacturing facility on a nearby planet, Lothal,"" She answered.""Ah.""Din jolted at a sudden explosion against the door. The blast, muffled by the metal, was familiar. His grip on the blaster pistol tightened as the sound repeated. And repeated. And repeated.It suddenly stopped. He took a look at Ahsoka, who was focused on the door, and gulped. She looked completely unafraid, with her lightsaber and–Din came to the profound and belated realization that a blaster was not nearly sufficient to challenge an Imperial Walker. He holstered his blaster. The Darksaber, which was currently vibrating into his thigh, somehow found its way into his grip yet again. It thrummed aggressively, and he ignited it. Suddenly, it was singing. Din nearly dropped it. He did his best to ignore it, instead focusing on the Imperial walker, if it would just blast down the door already. The repetitive clanging was becoming irritating, and he was growing impatient. Against his better judgement, he tightened his grip on the Darksaber's hilt. As per his instincts, it immediately went from weightless to about the same mass of a greater Krayt dragon. He stumbled forward as he fought to keep it from melting into the floor.Din made an undignified noise of surprise. He fell to one knee, the Darksaber held at an awkward angle over his thigh plate. He did not want to cut his leg off just because the Darksaber decided to be difficult. Decided. Well, now he had no choice but to begrudgingly listen to its singing. It went quiet all of a sudden. ""It is unhappy,"" Ahsoka said, loud enough for him to hear over the Imperial walker. Din tore his gaze away from the Darksaber to look at Ahsoka, alarmed. This is a bad time for a temper tantrum. Ahsoka's lightsaber isn't giving her any grief, so what the hell? ""Because you aren't listening. You're fighting it."" She didn't even look at Din as she spoke, but her amusement was obvious.""I am listening!"" He defended. ""It's quiet now!""Ahsoka seemed unconcerned. She shrugged. ""Then try to lift it.""Din sighed and attempted to stand. He was only failing terrifically when the metal from the hangar door groaned. It fell away from is frame and crushed a single shuttle in its path. With great effort, he managed to heave the Darksaber up, leaving a gash in the floor. Just as Din looked up, the walker's weapons array was turning to aim at them. He squeezed his eyes shut. I am going to die. Then, the hatch at the top of the walker popped open, and Din opened his eyes. Chopper sprang out and waved excitedly.  Din felt himself relax, the Darksaber lighter. He sighed and lifted it up off the ground. Ahsoka, still posed beside him, asked incredulously, ""Chopper?"" Chopper swiveled his head and said something before hopping out of the walker. While Ahsoka became occupied with Chopper as he flew over on little thrusters, Din sighed again and eyed the Darksaber. The blade, being a spiteful osik, was weightless. It hummed satisfiedly now, and Din narrowed his eyes at it before deactivating it. Weird laser swords were the Jedi's business, not his. Maybe he'd strongarm Skywalker into ritual combat for it so it could be his new problem. Speaking of Skywalker, where was he?Ahsoka, evidently, had been wondering too. Din watched as she kneeled in front of Chopper. ""Chopper,"" She said, one hand out to caress the droid's paneling. ""Did you happen to see my friend anywhere?"" Chopper purred, a terrifying sound. Then, he turned and gestured vaguely towards the walker. Skywalker leapt out of the cockpit and somersaulted into the hangar, landing in a crouch. Din, following Ahsoka, met him halfway across the hangar.""Is that droid a friend of yours?"" Skywalker said, indicating Chopper. The droid did a little twirl at being mentioned. Din didn't pretend to understand droids, and nor did he particularly want to, but this droid and Skywalker's R2 unit were disturbingly expressive. Ahsoka smiled back at him and set a hand atop Chopper's... head? Do astromechs have heads?""He belongs to a friend... someone close to the missing Jedi. I've lost contact with them, but according to Chopper, they're here on Garel,"" she said. Din almost choked at the mention of another Jedi. Another Jedi.Din let out a tense breath.""We should return him to them, then."" Skywalker placidly folded his hands. Ahsoka hummed in agreement.""If I am not mistaken, we should be able to find them in hangar bay seven."" Then, she added, ""We should also probably get out of here before the charges blow."" Din watched helplessly. If he wanted his kid back, he guessed he had to go with them. He didn't know what Skywalker's droid had done with him.There's no need to worry, Skywalker had assured him, R2 is an excellent babysitter. --The Jedi hadn't seemed to mind Din tagging along. In fact, they paid him no mind, chatting about someone named... Obi-Won? O'Ben? and his friend, Anakin – who was Skywalker's father, apparently – throughout their entire walk to the hangar. They hadn't even glanced back as the Imperial base exploded in the distance.Chopper had been rolling along with them, offering scathing interjections that Din could only parse out by the Jedi's reactions. He had been trying not to listen in out of courtesy, but apparently this Obi-Won and Anakin were like Ahsoka's brothers. Did that make Ahsoka Skywalker's ba'vodu? Or aunt? Or whatever Jedi ba'vod'e were called? Even though Jedi things were not his concern, Din still wondered why Ahsoka had told him about the kyber crystal but hadn't mentioned it to Skywalker.Din was absently worried about Grogu for much of the stroll to meet Ahsoka's friends. They came upon hangar seven, and he only noticed by Choppers loud exclamation.""The Ghost,"" Ahsoka remarked. By that, she must've meant the modified freighter in the center of the hangar. Its ramp was down, and Chopper was currently charging up into the hold, chattering excitedly. From inside came a loud expletive, followed by a fair amount of cheering.A gruff voice shouted ""Karabast, Chopper!"" and a large Lasat came tumbling out of the cargo hold. Chopper was relentlessly assaulting them, even as they lay sprawled at the base of the ramp. Four figures followed them - A bearded human who was chuckling at the Lasat, a Twi'lek holding the hand of a child, and-Din stopped walking at the sight of the short-haired Mandalorian holding the child's other hand, helmet under their arm. Suddenly, the urge to run away, find Grogu, and leave became incredibly strong. Ahsoka and Skywalker continued walking towards the group, leaving Din behind. The Mandalorian individual had grinned when they noticed Ahsoka and Skywalker, shouting ""Ahsoka!""The others had all sorts of unreadable emotions flitting across their faces. If Din thought he could slip away and escape the certain impending confrontation, his hopes were instantly extinguished by Ahsoka catching his eye. She flashed a knowing smile. He reluctantly followed.Skywalker came to a stop just feet from the Lasat, who was busy pushing themself off the ground. They were having a rough time of it, what with Chopper's persistence. Din hovered awkwardly some distance behind Skywalker, keeping the Mandalorian girl in his sights. Ahsoka stepped forward to greet the group.""Aunt Ahsoka!"" The child dropped the Twi'lek's hand and latched on to Ahsoka's legs. Is she just everybody's aunt?Din watched, bemused, as Ahsoka ruffled the child's choppy green hair. ""Hello, Jacen. You've grown so much since I last saw you."" The child pulled back and grinned up at her. ""Mom's teaching me how to fly!""Ahsoka kneeled in front of the child. ""I'm sure you'll be just as good as her someday. Have you been practicing your abilities?""The kid started bouncing giddily, and Din was worried he might vibrate off the ground. ""Yes! I can lift people now! Watch!""He held out his hand in the direction of the Lasat. The Lasat, who had just gotten back onto their feet, began levitating with a fair amount of shaking and annoyed shouts.The Lasat went limp and sighed. ""Did the kid really need to be a Jedi, too?"" The child giggled and dropped them. They gasped. ""Sorry, Uncle Zeb!"" Chopper cackles and pulled out one of his mechanical arms, pointing at the Lasat lying face down on the floor. Din felt his brain empty of any and all thoughts, only: There's more of them? ""Very good,"" Ahsoka said, pressing her palm to the kid's cheek. ""Your father would be very proud."" Din stopped breathing for a second. Was this kid's father a Jedi too? He was very confused. He had a great number of questions. Judging from how Skywalker had stiffened, he was likely a little out of the loop, too, so at least he wasn't the only one. Still, though, what the actual kriff.Jacen grinned and ran back to the Twi'lek woman, who Din assumed was the mom. She smiled encouragingly. The Mandalorian girl reached out to ruffle Jacen's hair, beaming fiercely. Ahsoka and the Twi'lek briefly embraced. Watching Ahsoka interact in such a domestic setting was mind-boggling enough to take away most of Din's apprehension. Then, just as the false sense of safety had begun to set in, the Mandalorian gestured in his general direction.""Who's this?"" She asked, eyebrows furrowed. Din had no idea whether she was referring to him or Skywalker, but either way, Ahsoka introduced Skywalker first. Thank the ka'ra.""This is Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master,"" She gestured to Skywalker, warmly smiling. Skywalker stepped forward and bowed. The Twi'lek appeared to recognize him, which Din found disconcerting. ""Are you the pilot who blew up the first Death Star?"" ""I am,"" He replied, ""I've heard that you're an impressive pilot yourself, General Syndulla.""If that was meant to be flattery, General Syndulla didn't seem to hear a thing. Her face only lit up, and she pulled Jacen to her. ""How did you do it?"" She asked. The three of them walked back into the hold of the ship, Skywalker detailing the fight and General Syndulla nodding enthusiastically. Din filed it away for later than he should talk to Skywalker about the N-1 sometime - Maybe he'd offer some pointers on starfighters. He heard Jacen exclaim ""My daddy was a Jedi, too!"" soon after they disappeared from sight. Din was now left alone with Ahsoka, Chopper, the Lasat referred to as 'Uncle Zeb', the bearded human, the Mandalorian and a dozen more questions. All his allies were gone, he feared.""They certainly hit it off quickly,"" Ahsoka commented. Much to Din's terror, the Mandalorian approached him. He locked his legs in place to keep himself from backing away.She stuck her hand out. ""Su'cuy gar, I'm Sabine Wren of Clan Wren."" Sabine Wren grinned at him. He stared at her arm for a moment, completely lost on what to do. Din looked back at her face. Well, she doesn't seem actively hostile. It's... probably okay.Clearing his throat, he clasped her forearm. ""Su'cuy gar, Sabine Wren. I'm Din Djarin, Clan Mudhorn."" She didn't let go of his arm. He started to get worried. Maybe she is hostile. Her eyes drifted to his belt. Oh no. She gasped. ""Is that the Darksaber?""""Uh... yes."" Why lie? It was the Darksaber. That was the simple part. Sabine looked him directly in the visor like she could see his eyes. Slyly, she said, ""I thought Lady Bo had the Darksaber."" Then, she let go of his arm. Her expression shifted to something roguish. Malicious. ""Game of dejarik for it?""

Chapter Text

Krownest felt much colder with House Vizsla's scrutiny. 

The ruling clans had momentarily united to criticize Din's abilities collectively, which he supposed was great for Mandalore but did not at all motivate him. 
Currently, they were having late meal in the Wren stronghold. Then, he'd be effectively kicked out of the compound with the rest of those not of Clan Wren or without special privileges.  Clan Wren, Clan Viszla, Clan Kryze sans Bo-Katan, and the others present whom he hadn't yet named seemed to be enjoying their gi dumpling soup and roba pie immensely, for the time being.  Din could only watch them enjoy their servings, because no one had bothered to bring him anything. 
Of course, they were right in presuming he wouldn't take off his helmet to eat, especially around them, but the sheer level of pettiness he'd endured was staggering. Throughout the meal, no one spoke directly to him, instead frequently side-eyeing him. They would utter scathing offhand remarks just loud enough for him to hear, and that was literally the only time anyone would acknowledge him. And it was with complete silence and pointed glares. He was going insane. 

Not to mention, sitting at the head of the table put him in the perfect position to be occasionally buffeted with dining utensils. 
Really, they could've just told him to fark off, and he would've. He would have gladly left already if they just stopped insisting he was Mand'alor, but no – They'd even anchored his N-1 so he couldn't get off-planet.Sabine and Rau had explained to him that the ruling houses were desperate and simply waiting for a gracious display of leadership prowess. Then,   they'd   left to go have dinner with a much more  accepting crowd on the Ghost, leaving him alone, outnumbered, and vulnerable. Why he had to stay when they were free to go, they'd also explained:   'The Mandalor  needs  to be present. Ceremony – you know how it is.'Someone threw their utensil at him, and it clanged off his bucket with the resonating ring of beskar and clattered to the floor. Evidently, he'd been wallowing in self-pity for too long and it was showing. The entire mess hall was silent, with Countess Wren on the other end of the table glaring at him. Instead of falling out of his chair and onto the floor as per his  instincts, he sighed. "" Mand'alor,  are you all right?"" She asked, the cynical tone to her voice made all the more sardonic by her steepled fingers and raised eyebrow. He sighed again and shook his head. Everyone glared at him like he was the most intolerable person in the known galaxy and had just ruined their entire life with his presence.
They could just let me leave. Why don't they just let me leave? 
At the same time, they looked like if he stood, they would immediately tackle him to the ground and cuff him to the table.His only option was to maintain his fortitude and sit there. One of the Mandalorians decked out in blue, black and gray in the middle of the table cleared their throat. To Din, them and their clan looked like nobility, and their shriek-hawk signets were all too familiar. ""Mand'alor, my clan and I have a few questions to ask,"" They said, settling a hand on their helmet atop the table. Their clan signet was not the only familiar aspect of this individual – He recognized the tone of their voice, too. This person was   definitely   a Vizsla. He wondered why, if the entire Clan Viszla was present, none had yet insisted that the Darksaber was theirs by ancestral right and that it belonged in someone else's hands. The Vizsla that Din knew had done that pretty much right off the bat, so what the kriff?
""Yes?"" Din replied, trying to sound as confident and long-suffering as possible. He was pretty sure he managed the exact opposite. 
The Mandalorian glanced at one of their clan members before looking back at Din apprehensively. ""I am Tal Vizsla, of Clan Vizsla. It is to my understanding that, being a Child of the Watch, you are technically of House Vizsla and have come into contact with my few living clansmen,"" Tal Vizsla narrowed his eyes, ""How have   they   responded to your claim as Mand'alor?"" Din thought he might've had the wrong idea about his   claim  as Mand'alor.
""I was challenged,"" He stated. No one should've had any issues with that, out of all the more colorful things he could have said – About Viszlas, about the Darksaber, about the general cynicism of existence as a whole. 
To his relief, there wasn't an immediate uproar at his response. However, Tal Vizsla was not satisfied, because why would he be? His eyes narrowed more. ""By  whom,  exactly?"" 
Din glanced around the room and was met by every unhelmed Mandalorian in the room staring right back at him. ""...Paz Vizsla."" 
The present Mandalorians broke from their pressuring stares to converse with one another. They appeared to be shocked, outraged, et cetera – All things they were great at conveying   with   helmets, it was just more terrifying without them.
A couple of Clan Wren – The one he believed was Sabine's brother and a Pantoran at his side – eyed him, talking quietly. Various others made exaggerated movements and mouthed things and glowered at him, all at the same time. 

Someone in Clan Kryze stood and slammed their hand on the table. ""Did you kill him?"" They seethed. 

Apparently, Paz Vizsla was a known name. He was having a little trouble telling who the target of their anger was, but it felt like him. ""No."" 

They took a deep breath, and another of Clan Kryze placed a steadying hand on their forearm. They sat back down. The volume level around the room continued to rise, some distinct rants louder than others.

Tristan Wren whispered something to his mother. The Countess stood, looking miraculously more irritated than before. ""Uur! Gedet'ye!"" Her voice echoed throughout the hall and the disorder, as requested, silenced. 
She returned to her seat, gazing over the guests at the table who glared right back at her. Then, everyone turned their glares at Din.  He felt the irresistible urge to cower under the table when Countess Wren met his eyes through the visor. Like some sort of predator.Being unable to cower, he stared blankly back – Not because he wanted to, but because Rau had advised him to, at all costs, maintain forced eye contact.   Never   look away first.
He was about two seconds off from looking away.
Tal Vizsla whispered something to his comrade before speaking up again. This drew the attention of Countess Wren, and Din practically deflated with relief when she looked away first. 
""Did you win through fair combat?"" Vizsla asked, raising an eyebrow. Din suddenly remembered he was being interrogated. 
""Yes. We both removed our jetpacks."" And if Din had the Darksaber and Vizsla had his  sheer hulking mass, that pretty much meant the fight was fair. Yeah.Another unfamiliar Mandalorian in gray, purple and yellow, eagerly spoke up.  They stood and leaned over the table. Someone in identical armor hadn't pulled their soup away before they planted a hand in it. ""You defeated Paz Vizsla in combat?"" Their enthusiasm was disconcerting . Din hesitantly nodded. They guffawed loudly and looked away from him before sitting down, arms crossed. 
""That is indeed a feat,"" The Mandalorian who had slipped away their soup said, expression unreadable and voice level. They looked across the table at Vizsla. 

Vizsla's posture had notably stiffened. ""I have one last question for you, Mand'alor. Lady Kryze has informed us that you removed your helmet on the bridge of an Imperial Light Cruiser, in the presence of herself, two aruetiise, Koska Reeves, Moff Gideon, and a Jetti, thus breaking the Creed of the Children of the Watch,"" Vizsla loomed closer to him, even from halfway down the table. ""Was your cult made aware of this?"" 
Din had a great many of thoughts while hearing this. Mainly   well, Moff Gideon was unconscious, cult is a strong word   and   who gave Bo-Katan permission to tell anyone?   Removing his helmet had been deeply personal for him – It wasn't part of the mission, it made no difference in commandeering the cruiser, and it wasn't her karking business. That was a serious breach of trust. What the  kriff?
""I did not permit Bo-Katan Kryze to share that information,"" Din declared. ""She had no right to inform you of that. It did not impact the mission in any way."" 

Vizsla evidently did not have the patience for this. ""Mand'alor, was your Tribe made aware of this?"" 

Realizing that he just admitted to breaking his Creed, Din sighed. Well, if he was rejected as Mand'alor because of this little complication, he wouldn't have to deal with these people anymore. It was, at the very least, an excuse to leave dinner. 

""Yes. They declared me dar'manda."" 

Vizsla narrowed his eyes and glanced at the Mandalorian to his right. ""Are you, perhaps, seeking redemption by becoming Mand'alor?"" 
Din recoiled at that idea. The fact that he had possession of the Darksaber hadn't changed the Armorer's mind when exiling him, nor had it motivated anyone to   unite under his rule. He was beginning to think that bit was just a formality. Mandalorians were typically not big on those.
""I am no longer seeking my Tribe's forgiveness.""

""If you renounce their Ways, then why do you not remove your helmet around those of your own kind?"" 
Did he really need to explain himself to everyone? Couldn't he just be a Mandalorian? ""Although I can no longer be considered a Child of the Watch, I don't renounce the Creed that I have followed my entire life. It is my own Way as much as it is the way of the Children of the Watch. Also,"" Din allowed his shoulders to slump, ""It's... good for anonymity.""
He had no idea where the sudden passion had come from, but as quickly as it had appeared, it faded. He felt awkward, looking around at the inscrutable and mildly peeved expressions of the gathered Mandalorians. 

Din got the distinct feeling that a storm was about to break. 

Someone threw another dining utensil his way.

Chapter 3: Born of Passion
    




Chapter Text
""-And then she kicked me out."" Din had just finished up summarizing the dinner in the passenger hold of the  Ghost. There, Hera and Ahsoka were watching him patiently, occupying the rest of the seats around the table. Jacen was bouncing impatiently in his mother's lap. 
Grogu was being surprisingly calm, drifting between phases of sleep and alertness. Every time he woke, he would start cooing bewilderedly and try to tap his little mythosaur pendant against Din's helmet. Din cradled him in the crook of his arm when he eventually fell back asleep. 
Sabine and Rau, who had just returned from dinner with Sabine's father, the rest of the Wrens, and the  many  others who hadn't attended dinner, had been pacing the hold, but somewhere between ""Bo-Katan ratted me out"" and ""someone  else  threw their dining utensil at me"", they'd each stopped and started staring at each other. Neither one of them had said anything yet, and aside from the hail pummeling the hull of the ship and Grogu's soft snores, it was quiet. 
Din watched Sabine and Rau, nervously waiting for their opinions. He himself had no idea what to make of it, aside from the general impression that the other Mandalorians did not like him. In fact, he was pretty much absolutely certain that they didn't like him. Which made it all the more nerve-wracking when Sabine asked, very pointedly, ""How did she kick you out, exactly?"" She looked away from Rau and met Din's visor, waving an arm around absently. ""Like, did she say 'we must discuss this information in private, leave us', or did she...?"" 

Din was taken aback by the civility of this suggestion and vehemently shook his head. ""No, she just stood and said 'get out.'"" 
Rau crossed his arms and frowned at the floor. ""That... makes things more complicated. Did you explain to them the circumstances in which you removed your helmet?"" 
Din sighed. ""I didn't get the chance to."" Then, he winced. ""...Would it have gone better if I did?"" 
Sabine crossed her arms and eyed him.  ""Depends. What  were  the circumstances?"" 
""Uhhh..."" Din gulped. He glanced around the room. Hera and Ahsoka were watching him, and even Jacen had relaxed in his mother's arms to stare. Rau took a step closer to Sabine, eyebrow raised. Din couldn't help but feel a little cornered. ""The... uh, well, the first time, I was logging into an Imperial terminal and it had to scan my face.""

""The first time?"" Sabine repeated. Din nodded hesitantly. ""Who saw your face?"" 

Din thought he had already reached his daily quota of helmet inquisition, but he appeared to be mistaken.""A bunch of Stormtroopers. And a few Imperial officers. And a former Imperial sharpshooter. And my face is in their database now. But they're all dead,"" Din took a sharp breath. He hadn't thought about this before. ""... Technically."" 
""So... that was the time  before  the Imperial light cruiser?"" Sabine asked, looking at him incredulously. 
""Yeah. I was trying to get the location of the light cruiser, which was why I had to log into the terminal.""

""And what about the time where Bo-Katan was present?"" Rau prompted. Din sighed. He didn't like thinking about that. 

""That time, I was... saying goodbye to Grogu before Skywalker took him."" Everyone was familiar with Skywalker, right? 

Sabine shared a look with Rau, and Ahsoka took the opportunity to lean in with an inquiry of her own. ""Luke has seen your face?""

Din hadn't been thinking about it at the time, but yes, Skywalker had seen his face. This meant they were much more closely bonded now than he was willing to admit. Although, he was a little more comfortable with this, considering Skywalker was a Jedi and not Mayfeld. He nodded. 

If Ahsoka was going to say something else, Rau's noncommittal conclusion took precedence. ""This is important,"" He declared. ""This could be decisive to you being instated as Mand'alor."" 
Din thought he knew better than to share his  own opinion, but he also thought they knew better than to believe that he actually  wanted  to be Mand'alor. If they hadn't realized it before, he told them point blank: ""I don't want to be Mand'alor."" 
Sabine's gaze snapped to his face, and Rau looked at him judgementally. He'd thought they might have some words to say about that. 

""Your training starts tomorrow,"" Said Rau. 
Din most definitely did not smack his head against the table and start crying, seeing as he was certain that was the opposite of respectable behavior. But he definitely, really,  strongly  felt the urge to. 
--

The second the Mand'alor had left the dining hall, the entire party descended into chaos. 
The Viszlas and Kryzes started yelling. Someone from House Kast cried, ""By the kriffing Manda, he defeated Paz Viszla?"" The verd'e of House Eldar all remained seated, but many were gesticulating and waving their arms around very animatedly. Someone accidentally smacked their soup bowl across the table.
Tristan conversed loudly with a Pantoran verd. This, coupled with the high-cielings, the Kryzes' shrieking, the Viszlas' proclamations, the Kasts' rowdiness, and the Eldars' discoursing made for a horrible headache on Countess Wren's part. 

""He and my sister are friends! I should talk to her-"" 
""He has no  pride  in his name-""
""He still claims to be a Child of the Watch-""

""MANDA, I JUST WANT TO SEE HIS FACE-"" 
""He is enemies with  my vodu, and even if he won I  refuse  to recognize him-""
""He refuted the Children of the Watch-!""

""He is not a true Mandalorian no matter what-!"" 

""Bo-Katan has no honor-""
""He  has no honor-!"" 
Overlapping snippets of arguing and shouting quickly devolved into fighting; The table was overturned, bowls were spilt, jetpacks were ignited, and Countess Wren found herself having to resort to violent measures to get everyone to shut up. 
At the sound of a blaster being fired thrice, there was a momentary pause. ""If you wish to fight, take it outside!"" She was  not  getting these windows replaced again when one of the airborne verde inevitably went soaring through the glass. She fired once more at the cieling, just to get her point across, and stared imperiously until  all  the jetpacks were deactivated. She was hoping this would get them to stop fighting altogether. However, she knew better as she watched them reluctantly file out of the throne room. There were many grumbles about not being able to break things and having to go out in the hail. Only the house leaders remained, sans Bo-Katan. Some Kryze verd was here in her stead. 
""We finally have a leader to unite behind, yet they are determined to start a war,"" the leader of House Eldar, Eun Eldar, said, sighing. Countess Wren couldn't agree more, but in actuality, it was to be expected. 
""House Viszla will not accept him as our leader,"" The Viszla leader stated. That was to be expected as well. ""He is not a true Mandalorian, no matter  what."" 
""Nor will House Kryze,"" said Bo-Katan's stand-in. Countess Wren hadn't expected anything else. 

Things were looking bleak for the next potential Mandalor – They were being stricter than they had in centuries, and Countess Wren seriously doubted it would be for their benefit.

""On the other hand,"" Eun Eldar started, side-eyeing both Viszla and Kryze, ""The Mand'alor has House Eldar's full support.""

The Kast leader – Tay Rowan? – nodded in solidarity. ""Likewise with House Kast."" 

""How can you acknowledge a member of the Children of the Watch as Mand'alor? He shows no pride in his name and hides his face. He is hut'tuunla!"" Viszla spat. 

Mandalorian politics had been messy as of late – Clan Eldar had become their own House, Clan Wren had grown large enough to break away from House Viszla, not to mention the House Kryze and Kast leadership being in limbo for an indeterminate length of time for indefinite reasons – and the Viszlas were not happy about it. Unfortunately, although perhaps particularly mercifully, Countess Wren was very acquainted with the Viszla type. She had accumulated the patience needed to power through their endless rants. 
The Kryze representative shot a glare Viszla's way. Most of the major Houses were still annoyed with House Viszla about Death Watch. ""House Kryze agrees. Additionally, Lady Bo-Katan still lays claim to the Darksaber and has yet to fight  him  for it. Until the score is settled, House Kryze cannot stand with him."" 
Tay Rowan scoffed. ""Oh, yeah, are you sure you don't just want to keep the Darksaber in your clans? Clan Viszla I get, but Clan Kryze barely held it for a day! And besides, isn't it time for a new kind of leader?"" 
""I would like to point out that the Mandalor technically is part of House Viszla, being a Child of the Watch, giving him the right to wield the Darksaber,"" Said Eun Eldar, hands clasped reverently. This effectively cut down Rowan's idea for a  new kind of leader . While it was a nice sentiment, the last few times they had attempted to garner ""new"" leadership, it had not ended well. They sighed dejectedly. 
""We do not claim the Children of the Watch as part of House Vizsla!"" Vizsla said. The Eldar leader smirked. 

""You claimed Paz Viszla, a known member of the Children of the Watch, as your vodu only minutes ago,"" They quirked an eyebrow, ""Perhaps there is some Clan bias at play here?"" 

The Viszla leader spluttered. ""Well- Yes! Of course there is! Paz Viszla is aliit!"" 

""Do you think the Darksaber should go to him, then? Even though the Mandalor won fairly?""

There was a groan of frustration. ""I-"" 

""Does... anyone know what Clan the Mandalor is part of?"" Rowan cut in, seemingly offhandedly. They gripped their forearms behind their back and rolled onto their toes, earning the attention of every House representative.

""There's a Mudhorn signet on his pauldron. Would that make him Clan Mudhorn?"" Eldar joined in on their aloud pondering. Viszla looked aghast. 

""He can't have a Clan! He has no clansmen!"" Viszla declared in exasperation. Eldar pointed appraisingly. 

""Ah, you see, but doesn't he have an ad? A Jetti ad?"" 

""YET ANOTHER REASON HE CANNOT LEAD OUR PEOPLE!"" 

""You seemed fine with the Jedi interfering when we invited Tano and Bridger,"" The House Kryze stand-in stated. They sent an accusing glare Viszla's way, hands on their hips and eyebrows raised.

""That's because- Ugh!"" 
""So if it's not that he doesn't have the right to rule, and not that the Darksaber wouldn't still be in House Viszla, and not that he's a Child of the Watch, and not that he has a  Jetti ad,""  Rowan listed off, ""Then what could it possibly be?"" ""He is an enemy of my vodu!"" It appeared to Countess Wren that House Viszla had run out of excuses to be angry. The fact that there were many frankly good reasons that they decided not to stick with only further proved that they really had no valid reason. They were still  desperately  trying, though.
""You've never claimed Paz Viszla before.""

""JUST WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, KAST? SAY IT TO MY FACE. SAY IT."" 
""I think you don't like him because he's a foundling,"" Tay Rowan sneered. There was no immediate objection from Viszla. ""Seriously, how di'kutla are you? Did you forget –  No one cares who your father was? "" While it wasn't necessarily untrue, calling a particularly entitled Viszla 'di'kutla' would not serve well for House relations. As if they  needed  another Civil War. The poor Mand'alor would be lucky if he never got instated, otherwise he'd have to deal with  this. ""WHAT?! Where the  kriff  would you get that idea? That is completely untrue!"" Viszla cried. 
""I THINK IT IS TRUE, ACTUALLY."" 

""WHERE THE KRIFF IS YOUR EVIDENCE, YOU SHABIIR?"" 

Rowan gasped in offense. ""HOW DARE YOU!"" 

Countess Wren knew that, at this point, the only thing stopping them from all-out brawling was the table between them. She decided that now would be a good time to end this conversation. ""Enough. If you wish to fight, go outside with the rest of your verd'e. This topic is dismissed for tonight."" 

Biting back a sigh, she watched as Viszla and Rowan eagerly rushed out of the mess hall, exchanging threats. The Kryze stand-in stiffly jammed their helmet on and followed. Only the leader of House Eldar remained, searching the room for their helmet. When they found it, they nodded in her direction before leaving as well. 

Once all the House representatives were gone and Countess Wren was alone, Tristan came into the room with his Pantoran friend. They offered to help her clean up, and she accepted. They replaced the table, picked up the bowls and utensils littered across the floor, set a few abandoned helmets atop the table for when their owners came back to reclaim them. Tristan, all the while, was asking questions about the House's verdicts – The same as before, she informed him. 

Tristan sighed as he carried one far-flung helmet to place on the table. His friend was rectifying the chairs upended around the room. ""I like him. Sabine likes him, too. I think he could be good for Mandalore,"" He said earnestly. 

Countess Wren was just about to respond to her son when the sound of glass shattering betrayed the grand entrance of a Kryze verd. They came soaring through the window and landed on the table, successfully strewing broken glass and the gathered helmets everywhere. They promptly got to their feet and flew back out the hole in the window, firing their blasters and shouting. 

Tristan and the Pantoran verd watched with a fair amount of shock. Countess Wren sighed deeply. 










Chapter 4: A New Foe Has Appeared
    




Chapter Text

""Hey, Djarin."" 

A nudge in the ribs by Sabine's boot. 

""Djarin.""

Another nudge, firmer.

""Hey!"" 

She kicked him this time. Frankly, Din was too sore everywhere else for it to hurt. He chose not to respond, laying sprawled on the ice. It was very cold; He could feel the frost on his helmet. Soon enough he'd probably get frostbite. 

The snow near his head crunched. Someone sighed. 

""Do you think he's asleep?"" Rau mused, in that accented voice of his. 

Sabine was closer now. He heard her amusement loud and clear. ""Maybe."" She nudged his helmet. ""Din, it's time to wake up."" 
He almost snorted. He would have, had he not been trying to maintain the image of  dead to the world . Maybe they'd leave him alone if he remained completely limp and unresponsive. He could even start fake snoring – Manda knew he needed the beauty rest. In truth, however, he was simply too resigned to care for Darksaber training anymore. Sabine groaned. The snow crunched again. ""He's ignoring us.""   Damn it .  
""Very perceptive, Sabine,"" Rau quipped. ""Perhaps we should bring him somewhere more private, like we did with you on Atollon."" 
Din still didn't understand. If Sabine had the training, the support of the Houses, and not to mention the support of the Darksaber, why didn't she just assume the title? Even if she was busy looking for the missing Jedi with Ahsoka, they seemed to have plenty of time to waste on  training  him. He also didn't understand why all the Mandalorian ruling Houses had to watch, either. They all kept scandalizing him. Sabine had ""reassured"" him that not even half of each Houses' verd'e were present, aside from House Wren, but he thought that was just ominous. Why would he want to lead  more  of these people? 
""You know very well why, Rau,"" Sabine sighed. Din tried to remember why, too. Something about the Houses being wary of just anyone who earned the Darksaber, especially after their last few leaders accidentally started wars before promptly losing their place as Mand'alor. So now, he had to prove his worth. It just sounded like Sabine's sad excuse to make him suffer. 

""And this wouldn't be nearly as painful for him if he would cooperate instead of letting me win every time."" Sabine punctuated this with another kick to the stomach, successfully rolling him onto his back. He wheezed. She towered menacingly over him, her hands on her hips, silhouetted against the cloudy sky. ""You aren't exactly asserting yourself as a formidable leader, buddy."" 

""Perhaps the guidance of a Jedi would be helpful,"" Rau said pointedly and particularly loudly. Din really couldn't blame Ahsoka for staying out of this, especially since she was guarding the kid from anyone that got too curious, or a Viszla who decided it was the opportune moment to take Grogu, fly him into the upper atmosphere, and chuck him into space. He didn't believe any of these Mandalorians could be trusted. Especially not the Viszlas. Just Ahsoka being here allowed him to focus on his current objective, rather than worry about the kid. 

Speaking of, his current objective was to convince them he was either dead or asleep. It wasn't going so well, but he would keep trying. Whatever it took. 

Sabine sighed and looked off into Ahsoka's direction. ""Ahsoka's refused to get involved further. Currently, she's our only resident Jedi.""

""Then why does she insist on being here?"" Rau demanded hushedly.

""She doesn't want to lose contact with me again. She's staying here until we can both leave to look for Ezra."" 
Din still didn't know who this  Ezra  was, but he could only assume he was the missing Jedi. He didn't know why  Sabine  was looking for him, though. Weren't Jedi and Mandalorians enemies? It appeared to Din that they worked pretty closely. Not only that, they had similar skill sets, too – The ability to deflect blaster bolts, for one. 
""Ah, yes. Bridger."" Rau was standing in Din's field of sight now. ""I'd fully expected him to have made his way back by now."" 

""You and me both,"" Sabine shrugged, despite the melancholic tilt of her helmet. She looked down at Din. He himself couldn't be bothered to wonder about what they were talking about. He simply stared listlessly past them. 

The silence drew on. The clamoring of the crowd had quieted. Rau was looking around uncomfortably. 

Then, the thudding of footsteps breathed life back into the audience, signaling the arrival of a newcomer. Din felt the vibrations in the ice, which couldn't have been less interesting to him. However, both Sabine and Rau looked at whoever was approaching. 

""Who is that?"" Sabine gasped, hand hovering over her blaster. 

Din found himself begrudgingly interested in whatever could have invoked this kind of reaction. He tilted his head back to see who was coming. 
When he saw who it was, he groaned and let his head thunk against the ice. He was  done  with this. He caught the tail end of Rau and Sabine's amused staring before the  new arrival  spoke. ""He's not asleep."" He could  feel  it as they got closer. Their booming voice practically caused the ice to  vibrate . A third looming figure appeared at the top of his vision, arms crossed  and helmet inclined disapprovingly. 
A sigh rattled from their vocoder. ""You know, that's not very Mandalorian of you."" 
Paz   kriffing   Vizsla, the Vizsla of the hour. Din felt the urge to roll back over and plant his visor in the snow. 
He weakly gazed up at Vizsla. ""You called me an apostate,"" He huffed. Vizsla leaned further over him. 

""If you took that personally, then it stands,"" Vizsla grunted, as dryly as ever. 
""Oh, so he   is   alive,"" Rau commented.   Unfortunately.  
Vizsla replied, ""Believe me, you can't kill this one."" Then, he reached down and grabbed Din by the arms. Din was not appreciative of the unexpected contact, especially since his arms were incredibly sore from all the Darksaber stances being drilled into him. ""Come on, Djarin, on your toes."" 

Vizsla clumsily pulled him to his feet, and even then Din nearly failed to stand correctly. He was tempted to just blatantly refuse and flop back into the snow. The second he was steady on his feet, he shrugged Vizsla's hands off and stepped away. 

Sabine looked at Vizsla with a warranted amount of skepticism. ""I'm sorry, but who are you?""

Vizsla straightened his shoulders and puffed out his chest, in standard Vizsla fashion. ""I am Paz Viszla, of House Vizsla,"" He declared loudly.  Din rolled his eyes. 

Rau exchanged a glance with Sabine. It appeared they were conversing telepathically again. Then, in sync, they both removed their helmets, which Din regarded as a dumb decision. They both knew that full well, though, so he didn't really care. 

Sabine smiled a knowing smile, helmet pinned against her hip. She stuck out her arm in the same way she'd greeted Din. ""Su'cuy gar, Paz Vizsla. I'm Sabine of House Wren. Are you friends with this di'kut?"" 
Now, this time, Din  did  snort and planted one hand on his waist. Unfortunately, that was the same place where one of Sabine's kicks had made contact, and there already seemed to be a bruise there. He tried not to show how much it hurt. 
Vizsla had stiffened the moment Sabine's vibrant hair and Rau's uninteresting face were revealed. ""You are not Children of the Watch,"" He observed, figuratively swatting away Sabine's friendly gesture. She pulled her arm back. 

""No, we're not,"" She replied, confident as always. ""We are true Mandalorians. That a problem?"" 

""You call yourself Mando'ade?"" Vizsla snarled, taking a step closer to Sabine. The urge to lay back down again returned in full force. 
Din's worldview had been shaken enough after meeting Bo-Katan that he'd gotten used to literally every other Mandalorian removing their helmets. None of them seemed to have a problem with it, and while may have been part of his code, it wasn't part of theirs. He didn't really find himself caring too much anymore. Vizsla, however, was not flexible enough to deal with this  and  liable to cause a major incident. Din was torn between trying to mediate and willing himself into unconsciousness. 
Rau was being helpful. ""We are all Mando'ade. Our culture is what unites us, not our philosophy,"" He interjected. Well, at least they weren't going straight to calling him a religious zealot. That might not have ended well. 
Vizsla snorted. ""Our philosophy is part of our culture. There is only one true Way,   dar'manda  ."" Was it just Din, or was his chestplate frosting over in the cold? ""Regardless of the codes we follow and what we believe, Mandalorians are stronger together,"" Sabine cut in. This led Din to again wondering why  she  wasn't Mand'alor already. She was qualified in every sense of the word. 
Vizsla didn't seem entirely remedied by Sabine's statement, but he was momentarily pacified. He grunted. ""Fine. I will tolerate your decadence, if only because the Children of the Watch wish to have a say in the fate of our Beroya, Din Djarin, should he become Mand'alor.""
--
Dinner that evening was tense. The icy draft in the room was either due to the broken window, or the coldness emanating from every Mando'ad in the room.

Sabine and Rau had decided to join 
them this time. Din had hoped the extra moral support would be an advantage. However, Sabine was sat with her Clan on the opposite end of the table. Extra seats had been brought in for Rau and his squad of Protectors, 

also

 on the other end of the table. And not to mention, Vizsla had joined as well. The tension from his presence alone easily outweighed any comfort offered by Sabine and Rau. 

Again, like every other dinner, Din hadn't been brought any food. However, Vizsla had, so Din realized it was just because no one liked him. How kriffing 
great
 that was. 

Vizsla had also insisted on sitting beside him, so any and all evil glares were lumped together between them. 

Yeah, Din was shivering. 

After about half an hour of silence and overly-aggressive dining, he leaned over to Vizsla and whispered, ""Why do 
you
 get food and I don't?""

Vizsla shrugged and continued cutting up his roba pie with a spare vibroknife, despite still being helmeted. Din sighed in exasperation and leaned back into his seat. He wished he at least had his son with him, 
that
 could make the will to die bearable
. 

For now, he just had to power through. 

Countess Wren cleared her throat, drawing Din's attention. Her face was twisted in a sour, pained expression as she looked upon him from across the table. ""Mand'alor,"" She said calculatingly. Din caught a snort from Viszla. ""Would-"" 


""Patu!""


A shriek echoing in the chamber stopped her. She looked halfway between nonplussed and irritated, but for Din, his parental instincts were kicked into overdrive. I 

recognize
 that shrieking.


There was another cry of ""Patu!"" A shadow formed on the window opposite to the hallway, outlining a little waddling figure. The culprit waddled into the room, eyeing the room with drooping ears. Immediately, Din clambered out of his seat and rushed to go pick up his son. 

He bent down and scooped Grogu to his chest, eliciting a whoop that swept through the utterly still room like snow wafting in. Din ignored the other Mandalorians, elated at the excuse to 

leave

. The Force really 

was

 real.

""Hey, pal, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be with Ahsoka,"" He said, cradling the kid carefully. He looked up to meet the glowering of over a dozen impatient Mando'ade. ""I apologize, I need to return him to the 

Ghost
."" 


Countess Wren looked revolted. Slowly, in a way that made Din's stomach drop to his boots, she spoke. ""Mand'alor, why don't you introduce us to your ad?"" 

He caught sight of Sabine hiding a smile behind her fist. 

His eyes flicked to the hole in the window, longing for an escape that repeatedly evaded him. With a sigh and a reluctant nod, he made his way back to his seat. 

He warily sat back down in his chair, defeated. Resigned. Hopeless. Everyone was watching him – Viszla, Countess Wren, Sabine, Rau. Subconsciously, he pulled Grogu closer to himself. His one ally in the world. 

Din heard Vizsla's dreadfully concealed chuckles. He elbowed Vizsla in the ribs, which only prompted more laughter and reinforced Din's conviction that no one liked him.

""Your child is a Jedi, correct?"" 

Din jolted as the 

other

 Vizsla spoke. The 

actively hostile

 Vizsla, whose name he didn't know and didn't care to. 

""He has had Jedi training, but he chose to stay with me rather than with the Jedi,"" Din told them. At least, that's what he'd put together after the kid had miraculously showed up post his visit to Yavin-4. 

""You do realize that the Jedi are an enemy of Mandalore?"" 


Oh, boy. 

Din wasn't excited to have this conversation. Not because he couldn't argue, but because honestly, he didn't give two shits. 

""I do acknowledge that we have fought against them in the past,"" Din said as he fiddled with Grogu's little hand, ""But I have fought alongside them and I believe that they would be a valuable ally for Mandalore."" 

There was utter silence. There was no movement, save for Paz Vizsla's unbothered sawing at his steak. All eyes were squinted in their direction. If this was a test, Din was not sure whether or not he was passing. 

Sabine was the first to speak. 

""You all have to remember how the Jedi have aided us in the past,"" She said, projecting her voice to everyone in the dining hall. 

Countess Wren stood and declared, ""I concur. Do we not remember Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger and Lady Tano? All of these Jedi have fought with us in the past. It is as the Mand'alor says – The Jedi are a valuable ally. Our past differences can only make us stronger together."" 

This left Din stupefied. Firstly, he had no idea Ahsoka was Mandalore's ally. He knew she was friends with Sabine, but he'd owed that to Sabine's 
other
 Jedi friends. 

Secondly, was Countess Wren 

defending him?


""Are we just going to forget about Kenobi? About Dooku? About Galidraan?"" Vizsla pressed, ""About the entire 

Mandalorian Wars?
"" 


Din had absolutely no idea who any of those people were, but he knew of the Mandalorian Wars. He thought that was a stupid basis for years of animosity, considering everyone else in this room had probably been clan enemies at some point yet were still getting along fine. Maybe fine was a stretch, actually. Tolerating each other was more realistic. 

""That is only more of a reason why their friendship could be invaluable,"" Countess Wren tilted her nose up and sat back down. 

""What about Kenobi? Was 
his
 friendship with 

Duchess Satine

 invaluable?"" Paz Vizsla spoke up for the first time since his arrival. 

The person who Din had been told was the House Eldar leader looked at Paz Vizsla. ""Paz Vizsla, I thought you were here to 

support

 your Tribe's Beroya?"" 

Paz Vizsla laughed menacingly. ""No,"" He said. The rumble of his voice made Din hold Grogu with both hands. ""I am simply here to represent my Tribe for a fair say in the trials of the new Mand'alor, since Din Djarin was raised and trained amongst our ranks."" 

The other Vizsla stood. With a furious screech, their chair flew out behind them. ""Your Tribe? Don't you mean your 
cult
?"" They said accusingly. 

In their hand was a vibroknife, which was pointed towards the head of the table. Din started to get worried they were going to throw it and subtly lowered the kid beneath the table. 

Some Kryze sitting near the Wrens and Protectors stood stiffly. ""The Children of the Watch 
abandoned Mandalore
. They have no say in our leadership."" 

The Vizsla punctuated this by embedding the vibroblade in the table. Din made a note never to engage a Vizsla in a political discussion. 

There was another chair screech. Din looked across the table to see a Mando'ad from House... Kast? They stood, arms crossed. ""Oh, yeah? And whose fault was Galidraan? Who already claimed their vodu 
despite
 them being a Child of the Watch? What's with the sudden change of opinion, huh, Vizsla?"" 

""Silence, Rowan!"" Viszla cried, slamming their fist down, ""You forget that the Mand'alor that you 

love so
 
dearly

 is 
also
 a Child of the Watch!"" 

Oh, so someone liked him. That was news to him. 

'Rowan' spluttered. ""The Mand'alor was a Foundling! It was not his fault he was found by the Children of the Watch!"" 

""So since he was a Foundling, he doesn't have enough knowledge of our culture to know any other Way?"" 

""IS THAT WHAT I SAID?"" 

""I DON'T KNOW, IS IT?"" 

Rowan gave a shriek of outrage and tried to launch themself over the table. They planted one foot in someone's soup bowl. Viszla yelled in response and yanked the vibroblade out of the table. They chucked it at Rowan, who deflected it with their vambrace and sent it 
right
 in Din's direction. 

In his final moments, Din glanced to Sabine and Rau. 

When the point of the knife was mere inches from his visor, Din closed his eyes- 

Only to open them and find that it wasn't planted in his forehead. Instead, it was suspended and vibrating violently in midair. He found himself looking down its blade. Then, he was looking down at his lap.

He glanced at the kid's outstretched hand, then back at the vibroblade. 

It dawned on him what was occuring, and he let out a deep, deep sigh. He grabbed the hilt of the blade out of the air. ""Thanks, kid."" Din stroked the kid's ear. 


""Yup!"" 


Din was so startled by this exclamation that he didn't notice how silent the dining chamber had become. 

Then, Rowan started screaming again, and the calamity of a Mandalorian political dinner was fully realized. 










Chapter 5: And The Journey Begins
    


Notes:

          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          




Chapter Text
Din was hiding out with Grogu in a dark room of the   Ghost   as he waited for the other Houses to stop fighting in the ice field.Sabine and Rau had ushered them there roughly 15 seconds after the table had been overturned. Rau had explained that he was just doing his job as a Protector – Defending the Mand'alor and their aliit.   That   was concerning. 
After Rau and Sabine had explained that what had happened technically counted as an attempted assassination, though, he thought he might've understood.
He'd been hiding here for about an hour now. Well, maybe hiding wasn't the best word – He'd tried to leave a couple times, since he felt like he should probably try to stop the Houses from fighting. Knowing two of them had already accepted him and at least  one  of the others didn't hate him made him feel just a  little  bit responsible.
However, Rau and Sabine had stationed themselves outside his door. Sabine had told him ""Don't worry, my mother is handling it."" 
Why couldn't her  mother  be Mand'alor?
It appeared that no one had a good answer for him. 
Especially not Grogu, who, sat across the holoprojector, was thoroughly destroying him at the game of cubikahd they were playing. He was giggling proudly and... relentlessly, too.   That's my boy.  
It was just as the kid had won a second time that the door opened. Light flooded into the room. Din looked up to see Sabine and Ahsoka silhouetted in the doorway.


Oh, no.


Sabine stepped into the room first. Her helmet was at her side, and her hair seemed to glint an ominous shade of purple in the dim light. There was something about her posture that made him uncomfortable. 

""Hey, Din,"" She said. Din noted her forcibly lighthearted tone and turned off the game of cubikahd. 

""...Yes?"" 
""Ahsoka told me something she thinks we could do to make the other Mandalorians like you."" The fact that she was talking to him like a fragile child aside, had Sabine been with Ahsoka in the other room? Did that mean she hadn't been there to block his escape? Could he have   escaped? 
Hell, he might just make a run for it now. 

Then, he registered the looming figures of Fenn Rau, Tristan Wren, and Chopper in the hallway behind them. He realized he was, to put it politely, kriffed. 

""Why do I want them to like me?"" He asked, eyeing Sabine's brother, who peered in from Sabine's side of the door. Apparently, they were doing guard rotations now.
 
""So that they don't kill you,"" Rau chimed in, leaning into the room from  his  post. 
Sabine shot him a glance that was difficult to read. ""Anyways, how do you feel about stopping by Dathomir?"" 

-- 

Sabine stood before the assembled Clan Council, helmet on and arms crossed. ""House Representatives,"" She addressed them, ""Lady Tano, Protector Rau, Tristan Wren, myself, and the Mand'alor Din Djarin are going to Dathomir.""

There was a collective cry of outrage. Sabine expected no less. She held her ground when the shouting began. 

""THE WITCH PLANET!"" 

""MAUL!"" 

""You can't go back there!"" 

""You can't take the Mand'alor! We booted his starfighter for a reason!"" 

""WHAT IF MAUL IS HIDING THERE?"" 

Yeah, most of the shouts were about Maul. Little did they know, Maul was long dead. Or so she assumed. It was to her understanding that he'd actually died before taking over Death Watch, so expecting him to stay dead was maybe too much to hope for. 

""Silence!"" Countess Wren commanded. Her voice echoed out from her throne and throughout the main hall of the Wren compound. Ah, yes, this was Sabine's mother at her best – Intimidating the other Mando'ade. ""Sabine, what inspired this?"" 

Before Sabine could spare her a glance, Ahsoka stepped forward. ""I had a vision, Countess. I believe that Dathomir is where not only Sabine and I need to go to find Jedi Knight Ezra Bridger, but where the Mand'alor needs to go to prove himself.""

Clamor emanated from every corner of the main hall, where each House was clustered. From the other Wrens and Protectors, mish-mashed together around the Countess; From the Kryzes and Vizslas, keeping to opposing corners; From Houses Kast and Eldar, who seemed to be working together and watching the Mand'alor's six from
 their positions on either side of the room. Paz Viszla was somewhere alone amongst all of this, leaning against a window, Tribeless.

Sabine could feel Djarin shifting uncomfortably at her side. Grogu made some adorable noise of comfort and tried to pat his father's thumb, which resulted in Djarin patting him on the head. She really couldn't get enough of them. 

""Since this matter involves the Mand'alor, we will leave it up to the House Leaders to decide,"" Mother said coolly. Sabine thought that made a whole lot of sense – The leader of their people needing permission from a Council to do something.

Sabine fought desperately against an eyeroll while the Houses discussed. All the while, House Kast and House Vizsla shouted across the room at each other.

""KRIFF OFF, VIZSLA!"" 

""SUCK IT, KAST!"" 

Man, did Sabine wish she hadn't been on security detail. She'd have killed to see how the brawl had played out earlier that evening.

Mother whispered to someone at the arm of her throne, side-eyeing Djarin. She straightened back up and cleared her throat. The room went silent. 

""House Leaders, what are your decisions?"" 

Eun Eldar was the first to step forward with a young Kiffar verd at their side. Both had their helmets at their sides. ""I would like to send one of my own verd'e, Draaven Tirich, to accompany the Mand'alor as extra protection,"" Eldar said, turning from Mother to look at Djarin. ""With the Mand'alor's approval, of course."" 

Djarin came out of the blue and said ""Of course. You are welcome."" 

She thought she heard the Kiffar squeal a bit before jogging into the center of the room to join them. 

The House Kast stand-in spoke from the other side of the room. They all turned to listen. 

""House Kast, too, would like to- Uhm-"" They spoke like someone was poking them in the back. With one cold glance at Vizsla, though, they pushed out a sentence. ""We would also like to send one of our own verd'e for protection, with the approval of the Mand'alor..."" They held out their arm. ""Niratap Kardama."" A flustered-looking Nautolan stepped forward beside Tay Rowan. 

Niratap Kardama appeared to be missing their helmet. Rowan smacked them heartily on the back, prompting an uncomfortable little wave. 
""Feel free to call me Nira, Mand'alor,"" They said,  also  sounding like they were being poked in the back. Huh. She'd have to ask mother to check in on the Kasts. Was a bug going around, or was it just the Mand'alor's magnetic personality?
""You are welcome as well,"" Djarin said. Nira grinned and ran over to join them. Sabine watched as they started whispering excitedly with Draaven.
Probably just starstruck, she realized. Younger verd'e were like that.
""House Vizsla will also be sending one of our own warriors, not for protection, but to keep tabs on the activities of the Mand'alor."" 

Tal Vizsla had always annoyed Sabine.

""You can't do that, Vizsla! He is our Mand'alor!"" Rowan cried. 

Vizsla got a crooked smile. ""Transparency is something every government needs."" 

""HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT HIM!""
 ""I'M   THE DISRESPECTFUL ONE?"" 
""YEAH!""
""AT LEAST MY VERD'E DON'T LOOK AT HIM LIKE THEY WANT TO-""""Rowan, Viszla,  please."" Mother pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed. ""Vizsla, I do not understand why the Mand'alor would need your Clan's supervision when there are already many others who will be with him. They are fully capable of doing what you suggest."" 
Before Vizsla could respond with some caustic remark, Djarin made a placating gesture. ""It's alright. If one of your verd'e wishes to join us, feel free."" 
There were murmurs spreading throughout the Mando'ade. Sabine turned around and met eyes with Rau and Tristan, who seemed as hapless as she did. Rau gestured emphatically. And yeah, Djarin really was turning out to be as big of a nunahead as Sabine had suspected.
Just behind them, though, Draaven and Niratap were still dancing and mouthing words to their Clans. Sabine watched as Nira clapped one hand over their mouth and pointed at Djarin's back, making eye contact with Rowan, while Draaven was bouncing on their feet and grinning towards the Eldars. 
At least it seemed like Din had a few loyal supporters. Perhaps his dumbassery was part of the allure. 

On Din's other side, Ahsoka had her hands clasped behind her back and was very obviously biting back a smile. Djarin, of course, appeared graphically oblivious, too immersed in fidgeting with Grogu's claw.
""House Vizsla,   will   you send a representative?"" Mother pressed, an affronted eyebrow raised. 
""Yes."" Vizsla sounded just as intolerable as he did before, but there was a difference in the tone of his voice that Sabine hadn't expected. Was that... a change of heart she heard? 

""I, Tal Vizsla, will be going as representative of House Vizsla."" 

Tal Viszla strode across the room to join their little group. There was a chorus of displeased sounds. Yeah, Sabine definitely wasn't the only one. 
""Very well,"" Mother said. Even  she  seemed a little annoyed. ""And would House Kryze-"" 
""Lady Bo-Katan will be waiting on Dathomir."" 
Mother narrowed her eyes at the Kryze representative. ""And why would she be  there?"" 
""We just contacted her about the Mand'alor's trip to Dathomir."" 

That was a bit of a security issue. Now when did they get the time to do that?

Mother looked bothered. She sighed a deep, heartfelt sigh. ""Very well. I have been informed that the Protectors also wish to accompany the Mand'alor to his destination. Does the Children of the Watch representative wish to join as well?"" She waved a hand in the direction of Paz Vizsla,  who looked more or less entertained by everything.

He snorted derisively. ""Like I would miss this party."" He strode across the room and stopped next to Sabine. They exchanged curt nods, but Sabine was inwardly wondering who the kriff this guy thought he was. 

Vizsla leaned over Sabine and out of the corner of her eye, she saw Djarin tense. ""You're not leaving me behind just yet, Djarin,"" He taunted.

 Ooh, what is  this  dynamic?  

""Are these all who wish to go?"" Mother asked. 

There was silence.

Mother clicked her tongue. 

There was more silence.

Ahsoka stepped forward. Her robes flowed around her ankles, her arms were crossed. With her diplomatic Jedi charm, she said, ""Countess, if it's at all possible, we will need to be on our way as soon as possible."" 

""I understand. I will lend you a cruiser for your journey. I wish you luck in your search, Lady Tano."" She tilted her gaze down at Djarin. ""I wish you luck with your trials as well, Mand'alor. You will need it. Dismissed."" 

The various groups of Mando'ade began filing out of the room. Other than their little group, of course, some of whom got high-fived or clapped on the back by their Clans. The Protectors made no move to leave, either; They were more than likely waiting for the Mand'alor to leave first. 

When the last few of House Kast were scampering out the doors, Sabine's mother stood and descended the steps from her throne. Sabine reverently dipped her head. ""Thank you, mother."" 

Mother placed her hands on Sabine's shoulders and smiled. ""Of course, Sabine. I trust you will make your way back to us."" 

Sabine smirked. ""Always."" 
Mother placed a hand on Tristan's shoulder then, too, and bid them, Rau, and Ahsoka farewell. She haughtily turned her eye on Tal Viszla, Draaven Tirich, Niratap Kardama, and the unintimidated Paz Viszla. He didn't make Sabine feel small, but   Manda, he was huge. Then, Mother spoke  at  Din. 
""I wish for you and your child's safety, Mand'alor Djarin,"" She said, ""I hope your journey to Dathomir is fruitful. It would be unfortunate if the Darksaber was lost there again."" 
She moved to the exit, only stopping to say ""The cruiser is on the far side of the ice plains. I trust you can make it  that  far on your own. Good luck. Retur'cye mhi.""
With that, she was gone, and Din was already looking at Sabine for guidance. 
Oh, he had   no   clue what he was getting himself into.

Chapter Text

Din was exactly three hours into his journey to become the ideal Mand'alor or whatever, and he was already caught in the middle of a whiteout blizzard. 
Why the  kriff  did he ever agree to this? Couldn't he have just taken the   Ghost   with Ahsoka, Grogu and Sabine? Or flown with the Protectors to the far side of the ice plains? Why was he here? 
Also, why did Nira and Tal Vizsla insist on coming along if they were just going to argue the whole way? 

 ""Don't look at the Mand'alor like that. I can see you looking at the Mand'alor like that.""  

 ""Kardama, I can't even  see  the Mand'alor. Just leave me alone.""  

 ""How do I know that if  I  can't see  you?""  

Din sighed. He hoped it wouldn't pick up over the static of their private comms. 
 ""Well said, Mand'alor,""   Said Rau, merely a few feet away from him. He and Tristan Wren were the only murky figures in view. Both had been sticking by his side for much of the trek, and seemed just as unhappy as he was. A pained sound came from Tristan's comm.   ""Would we even be caught in this storm if Kardama hadn't insisted on taking the extra time to look for their helmet?""   ""Hey! I need my helmet, Wren. It wouldn't even have been a problem if a   Vizsla   hadn't yanked it off!""   ""Are you sure it wasn't a Kryze? No one from House Viszla wants to see that ugly mug of yours, I can promise you   that,"" Tal Vizsla scoffed. ""Let's not lower ourselves to insulting others appearances,  Vizsla,"" That was Draaven Tirich, joining the discussion,   ""After all, you wouldn't want others to insult   your   ugly mug. You'd never get a moment of peace.""  
""Wait,"" Din stopped, spotting a looming shadow through the dense snow. The static of the comms cut out for a peaceful second. ""We're almost there."" 
Rau exhaled.   ""Finally.""  ""Yes! I can finally get away from Viszla!""  Nira cheered. They jogged past Din.   ""Let's go!""  As they all started walking again, Paz Vizsla's comm crackled into the conversation.  ""Rushing ahead before the Mand'alor? Isn't that disrespectful, Kardama?"" Of  course  the first thing Vizsla said after three hours was mocking him. Din would absolutely  not  be acknowledging that. 
They trekked on towards the shadow in the fog. Nira's comm had stayed silent after Vizsla's remark, which Din thought was odd. They seemed to take anything a Vizsla said personally. ""Is the ship there, Nira?"" Din asked. 

What was even more odd was that they didn't respond. 
Din stopped in his tracks. The snow swept his cape around his waist.   Did they go inside already?   ""Nira?"" He tried again.
Nira still didn't answer back. The blizzard howled. The ice shuddered, and he was painfully reminded it could crack at any time. 
 ""I have a bad feeling about this,""   Rau mumbled, standing beside him. At his other side, Tristan whimpered.   ""Don't say that. It'll come true.""   Tristan was already reaching for his blaster, though.
Following Tristan's lead, Din pulled his blaster into his palm and tried one last time to hail Nira. ""...Nira?""
If they had just responded, everything would have been  so  much easier. 
Instead, red blaster bolts lit up the snow, illuminating the distant figure of Nira running from the colossal shadow, which lurched and was now rushing after them. Their comm became audible. 
""AAA-AAAAAA--""  They fired their blaster behind them. The shadow roared.   ""AAAAAAAH--""  
The shadow was coming up behind them quickly, spewing snow and ice. ""Nira! Go left!"" Din shouted. Nira dove to the side and rolled the remainder of the way out of the shadow's path. It plowed past them.
 ""It's a ravinak! Everyone scatter!""   Shouted Rau. Then, Tristan and Rau disappeared from his sides, leaving Din alone in the path of the rapidly approaching  ravinak . Of course  Krownest had ravinaks. Of  course . Why would the Wrens settle on a planet that  didn't  have ravinaks and had, say, domesticated bloggins? Din could hear the ice beneath his feet cracking as the monster grew nearer. This was not the closest he'd been to a ravinak, but it was definitely the most intimidated he'd ever been by one. Not only was it  huge , but it seemed hungry and solely fixated on taking  him  out.  ""Mand'alor! Get out of the way!""   Nira shouted. More blaster bolts lit up the snow, revealing Tirich and Nira on one side of the beast, firing ceaselessly. Behind a curtain of snow, Rau, Tristan and Tal Vizsla shot ineffectually at its other side. Din didn't spot Paz Viszla in the mix, but he wasn't really concerned about him at the moment. Today had been a horrendous day, even by Din's own standards. First, Vizsla had showed up, then he'd almost gotten assassinated by  another  Vizsla at dinner, and now, he was probably going to get eaten. 
Whatever. At least that was conclusive. 
Din sighed and yanked the Darksaber from its hook on his belt. If he was dying today, it was going to go with him. It  was  the reason he was here, after all. If he'd never gotten it in the first place, he would've been hanging out in a shady cantina with the kid, rather than facing down a ravinak in the middle of a blizzard.
The kid...

Well, at least he was safe.
Din ignited the Darksaber and held it out to his right. He hoped that its blade would at  least  stun the ravinak enough for the others to escape. The ship couldn't be  too  far.""Go! Get to the ship!"" He shouted, hoping the others could hear it over the roar of the ravinak – the howling of the blizzard – the cracking of ice – the kriffing   loud   humming of the Darksaber. He gripped the hilt of the Darksaber, willing it to not get heavy, and tensed himself for when the ravinak would make impact and his insignificant life would be snuffed out.   Any second now – He did   not   yelp when he was tackled from the left and grabbed around the waist.  ""Like I said,""   Paz Vizsla taunted, hoisting Din over his shoulder and taking flight with his jetpack,   ""You're not leaving me behind just yet.""  
As they flew through the blizzard, the ravinak bulled into the spot where Din had just been standing and disappeared with a shower of ice. 
They flew above the clouds and joined the others, who were already airborne and speeding away in a group. Din would've demanded Vizsla put him down, but he  really  didn't feel like falling into the storm below. It wasn't pleasant to be buffeted by wind from the backside, though. Nor was it pleasant to get an eyeful of   Vizsla's   backside.  ""Sabine was right, Mand'alor,""   Tristan called from the head of the group,   ""You really  are  a nunahead.""  Paz Viszla grunted, which Din had learned was his equivalent to a chuckle. ""I'll   say."" 
Din groaned and resigned himself to hang limply over Vizsla's shoulder like a sack of desolate meilooruns until they made it back to the ship. The Darksaber, still lit, dangled loosely in his grasp, but didn't fall into the clouds below. Its vibrations burst in a rhythm that Din strongly felt was jeering. He sighed.

-- 

The flight only took about 2 minutes by jetpack. When they touched down in front of the ship, Vizslq dropped Din on his buy'ce and walked up to meet the others on the landing ramp. 

Din was fine with this, of course. He was perfectly happy to lay in the snow. 
Until he realized that Vizsla had taken the Darksaber, that   kriffer – 
Din reluctantly hoisted himself to his feet and stumbled after him. 

Vizsla had his back to Din. He was observing an interaction between Sabine, Ahsoka, and the others they'd traveled here with, hands placed on his hips with typical Vizsla bravado. The Darksaber was clipped to his belt

""What took you guys so long?"" Sabine was saying. Her arms were crossed, and she looked somewhat peeved. ""We need to leave as soon as possible."" 
Tirich gestured over their shoulder with a thumb. ""Sorry, the Mand'alor was trying to get eaten by a ravinak."" 
Vizsla scoffed and crossed his armored forearms, like the smug asshole that he was. He didn't have time to react when Din yelled ""VIZSLA!"" and tackled him from behind. 

""Wh-"" 

They tussled for a moment. Din waited until he was on top to look directly into Vizsla's visor and say, ""Give it back."" 

Vizsla sounded like he was trying not to laugh. He cleared his throat and tried to push Din back by the shoulders. ""Wh- Give what back?"" 

Din punched him in the exposed portion of his stomach and grabbed the Darksaber from Viszla's belt. How dare Vizsla take it from him, when it was not nearly as miserably bonded to him as it was to Din?

As he stood, Din made sure to plant one boot directly in Vizsla's stomach. 
He dangled the Darksaber hilt in front of Vizsla's visor. ""This, you  hu'tuun ."" Din snatched it away before he could try to grab it and tucked it away in his belt. 
Vizsla coughed. As if he thought Din was stupid. It was a horrible disguise for a laugh, and Din kicked him again. ""What, I thought you didn't want it!""
""Well I definitely don't want   you   to have it!"" 
Vizsla guffawed and made an effort to get to his feet. He fell back onto his shebs when he couldn't pull his legs from the snow, much to Din's satisfaction. Vizsla gestured exasperatedly. ""You got it back now, didn't you? Mind helping me up?"" 

Din took an indignant step back. Vizsla groaned and began pawing at the snow encasing his boots. 
The  other  Vizsla stepped forward from the group arranged around them. ""Here, vodu,"" Tal Vizsla said, holding out an arm, ""I'll  help you up."" Paz Vizsla made an overdramatic sound of appreciation. ""Ah,  thank you, vodu."" As Tal Vizsla pulled Paz Vizsla out of the snow, both sent cold looks in Din's direction. Paz Vizsla gestured to Tal Viszla as soon as he was on his feet. ""See, Djarin? This is how  true  verd'e act."" 
Din scoffed. ""Yeah, go suck a blaster bolt."" 

Sabine exhaled loudly, drawing their attention. It was suddenly very evident to Din that there were six other people watching. 

""Are you two sure you're not vod'e?"" She chuckled, tilting a hip. 

""No,"" Was Paz Viszla's immediate response. Din elected to one-up him.
""I'd rather be eaten by a Krayt,"" Din spat. No one needed to know that technically, he already  had  been eaten by a Krayt. It wasn't actually  too  bad. He had it noted as an easy way to get out of unpleasant situations. 

Damn it, I should've tried getting eaten by a Krayt before I let Sabine drag me here.


Sabine sighed. ""Settle this on the ship, verd'ike. We don't have time for anymore dilly-dallying."" 

Din wasn't sure he appreciated being called a verd'ika. Nonetheless, he agreed.

Everyone made their way up the ramp in their own fashions. Tristan, Rau and Sabine formed their own little trio and were speaking in hushed voices that Din found suspicious. Nira and Tirich followed enthusiastically. Then, the two Vizslas went up, sneering at Din. 

This left Din at the bottom of the ramp, standing with his boots buried in the freshly fallen snow. He wasn't alone, though. Ahsoka had stayed back with him. 
She smiled at him. Her eyes held a knowing humor that Din thought was kriffing freaky. ""Grogu tells me you  have  been eaten by a Krayt before,"" She said, gesturing for him to join her on the landing ramp. He sighed and reluctantly moved alongside her. It took an unnecessary amount of effort for him to pull his legs from the snow, but he managed. As he walked with her up the ramp, he tried his best to mimic her Jedi calm. ""Where  is  the kid?"" 
Ahsoka clasped her hands. ""I left him with the Protectors,"" She said, as if there was nothing wrong with that statement. 
""What?""  Din broke into a run and went to find his kid as fast as he could. Those Protectors could  not  be trusted.




Notes:

dins having a day










Chapter 7: Osiks, Little and Big
    




Chapter Text

The second Din walked into the main passenger hold, he just 
knew
 something was wrong. 

For starters, the Protectors were crowded around Grogu. A Pantoran verd that Din recognized stood at the forefront of the group, arms crossed menacingly over a blue chestplate. Behind them, the rest of the Protectors stood in similar positions, some with helmets, some without.

All of them were staring down the group that had just returned with Din. Well, other than Rau and Sabine, who stood off to the side. Like smart people, they weren't getting involved. 

Din, however, was not smart, and just so happened to hone in on Grogu amongst the Protectors. 


Oh, what the hell.


He rushed into the room. ""What's going on here?"" He demanded, slightly more aggressive than he'd intended. 

""Mand'alor, these defilers were trying to harm your ad!"" The Pantoran verd spat. Din recoiled slightly. 

He walked up, ready to shove his way through the Protectors to get to the kid, but lo and behold, they easily parted for him. He tried not to look too disturbed. 

He picked up Grogu, holding him protectively. ""Why is he here in the first place?"" 

""Lady Wren said that we needed to protect him with our lives,"" The Pantoran's voice dropped off, their buy'ce tilting towards Sabine. 

""Hey now, I'm not part of this,"" Sabine said, putting her hands up. 


Like hell she isn't. 

Din didn't want to deal with this anymore, though. He needed to save his energy for Dathomir, or he wasn't going to make it that far. 

Although maybe that would be for the best. 


""Well, he's fine now,"" Din stated, leveling a look at each of the Protectors. 

""Uhhh... Roger that... 'Alor,"" The Pantoran answered haltingly, glancing back and forth between him and the group. ""Are they a threat, though?"" 

""I won't tell you they're not,"" Din remarked. Really, they didn't to worry about them being a threat, because he was not leaving the kid alone again. No matter what Sabine or Ahsoka said. He'd either be with him or with Ahsoka. No more leaving him unattended.

As he stormed out of the passenger hold, he pointedly did 

not 

look at Paz or Tal Vizsla. 

Now, to find himself a room and become a hermit with his son and the Darksaber. 

""You found him?"" Ahsoka called from down the hall. Don't get him wrong, he had a lot of respect for her. That didn't mean he was going to reply, though. 

--

""What's with him?"" Paz Vizsla asked, breaking the tension left in the room after Djarin stormed out. 

Sabine sighed and tilted her helmet at him. ""I would think that out of anyone here, you would know,"" She uttered in reply. 

She didn't know what had happened out there, but Djarin obviously wasn't putting up with any more shenanigans today. 

Tristan broke away from his squad and joined her and Rau. ""You know, the more time I spend with him, the less I think he likes us."" 

The Pantoran at the forefront of the Protectors – Dalirin Koma, she thought was their name – looked incredibly confused. ""Did we do something to offend him?"" They asked no one in particular, ""I mean, we were protecting his ad."" 

Sabine sighed and stepped forward to pat him consolingly on the shoulder. ""You didn't do anything wrong. He just doesn't trust us, is all. Any of us."" 

""He's a little osik, that's his problem,"" Paz Vizsla chimed in unhelpfully. 

Nira Kardama scoffed. ""Your clan is full of little osiks, Vizsla. You don't get to say shit."" 

""Yeah, Vizsla. Maybe if you quit provoking him, he might tolerate us,"" Draaven Tirich pointed out, crossing their arms, ""That goes for both of you."" 

They weren't exactly wrong. Sabine still didn't think taunting two Viszlas was the way to go. 

Manda, the things she put herself through for Ezra.










Chapter 8: Sabotage

Chapter Text

""You sure you want to make that move, Mand'alor?"" Sabine taunted, her eyes glowing. ""You might just win."" 

Din had to bite back a sob. This was the most strategic way to lose. There was no way he could win. At least, he really kriffing hoped so. ""Sure about that?"" 

Sabine narrowed her eyes, watching as he made the move. ""Fine. It's your right to rule, not mine."" 

Then, just as he was in the perfect position for her to kick his shebs and call it a day, his damned dejarik character scooped up hers and tossed it to the ground. Nira and Draaven both started cheering from over Din's shoulder. The holotable displayed his character dancing over Sabine's corpse, and for the fiftieth time, Din felt like slamming his head against the table. 

""Good game, Mand'alor,"" Sabine said cheerfully, picking up the Darksaber from the edge of the holotable and tossing it back to him. He made no move to catch it. It thunked against his chestplate like a brick. 

""You let me win,"" He nearly whined. Nearly. Because even if he didn't want to be, Nira and Draaven were the two people on this ship that considered him Mand'alor, so he at least had to act somewhat dignified. 

""Hey, do you have any idea how insulting that is?"" Sabine said with furrowed eyebrows. 

He sighed, staring forlornly down at the dejarik characters. ""I want a rematch.""

""Din, that was our third rematch. I'm cutting you off and going to my room."" 

""Please?""

""Nope."" Sabine stood, stretching out her back and grabbing her helmet. Her seat was immediately filled by Nira, who was grinning wildly.

""Play me, Mand'alor! I'll gladly let you kick my shebs!"" 

Din was about to just hand them the damn thing and call it a game when the alarm lights began blaring red. 

Oh, ka'ra. 

Nearly too eagerly, he bolted out of his seat and ran to the cockpit. Sabine, Nira and Draaven were all on his heels; Everyone else was probably on their way, too, but out of spite, he made it his personal goal to be first. 

Alas, he was. That was something to revel in. 

He was not, however, revelling when Tristan hopped out of the pilot's seat with his palms raised, face cast in red light.

""I don't know what happened. The hyperdrive just went offline,"" He sufficed. Din rushed up to the piloting console, clicking buttons and doing whatever felt right and like it could keep them from getting blown up. Not the best strategy, but it worked.

""Tristan!"" Sabine scolded her brother, just out of Din's peripheral. 

""What!? I just said I don't know what happened!"" 

""Uh, Mand'alor, you sure you know what you're doing there?"" Nira asked, as perceptive as ever. 

""Definitely,"" Din replied, pressing another button and yanking a handle that he had a feeling would get them out of hyperspace one way or another. 

Thankfully – For the rest of the people on board, not for him personally – they dropped out of hyperspace. Nira stepped away from the back of his chair. Their grip left an indent in the leather.

""Phew! Sorry for doubting you,"" They chuckled. 

Din nearly said, 

don't worry, I did too, 

but he was too bothered by the sight of the planet in the viewport. 

""That doesn't look like Dathomir,"" Draaven observed. Who would've guessed; It was kriffing Tatooine. Tilting his helmet, Din took it in – The painfully reflective desert planet in the sky before them, the blaring red of the ship layout displayed on the console. That took precedent. It was insisting something was wrong, and Din had to agree. 

""Dank farrik,"" He murmured, tapping a few things on the screen, ""The hyperdrive's offline."" 

Ahsoka's soft footsteps came down the hallway. ""What's going on?"" She asked, entering the cockpit. Adding his two chits in, Grogu whined along. 

Din spun around in the chair and stood, immediately rushing up to her to take his kid. ""The hyperdrive's down,"" He informed her. 

Humming, she passed Grogu over to him. 


My son. 

Din snatched him. 

""Tatooine? But that's halfway across the galaxy from Dathomir,"" She frowned deeply. Right, that wasn't
 good.

Sabine pushed Tristan aside and, crossing her arms, came over to them. ""Then it must have been sabotaged,"" She said grimly. 

Great. 
As if he'd thought that getting pelted with dining utensils and dragged through a blizzard was the worst it could get, he was always being proved wrong. 

Three more sets of heavy footsteps were making their way down the hall now – One definitely that of Paz Viszla, the massive scughole. The other two were considerably less unhurried and more irritated. 

""If you wouldn't mind being more liberal with your stomping–"" Yep, that was Rau. 

""Who takes naps? Mando'ade don't nap!"" And Tal Viszla, the 

other

 Viszla. 

""I wasn't 
napping. 
I was sleeping. Do you not sleep, Vizsla?"" 

""Alright, which one of you mudscuffers sabotaged the hyperdrive 
and 
set the trajectory for Tatooine?"" Sabine glowered towards the three people in the hall, two of whom stopped dead immediately. 

Rau, of course, scurried out of the hall and into the cockpit. By the look of him, he'd just woken up. To the sound of Viszla footsteps, too. Never a great thing to wake up to. 

""Why do you think it was us, 
Wren?"" 
Tal Viszla crossed his arms indignantly, tilting his helmet. ""Wasn't 
your brother 
the one flying?"" 

""I took over for you like an hour ago. Until then, 

you

 were flying. You could've changed the trajectory,"" Tristan argued back, stepping forward. 

""Gah, we were in 

hyperspace! 

I thought you were smart enough to know that's not possible. And besides, who was flying before me, huh? It was one of Rau's Protectors – 

Koma!"" 


""Which would give you two time to sabotage the hyperdrive!"" Nira added, also taking a confrontational step forward.

""You wanna accuse me of something, 
Kardama,
 then say it."" 

""But– I did say it! Just now!"" 

This was not productive. And while Din did not want to be here, kriff it, he kind of had a duty. 

""Both of you need to stand down. Arguing isn't going to fix the hyperdrive 
or
 get us to Dathomir,"" He said, making what he hoped was a placating gesture with his free hand. ""For now, let's land and get the hyperdrive fixed before pinning the blame on anyone. Then, you guys can... fight it out or whatever it is you need to do. It makes no difference to me, so long as we're not wasting time. Got it?"" 

Grogu babbled in assent, so at least he knew someone was on his side. 

The cockpit went silent. The only sound was the beeping of the comms system, which honestly, Din preferred to direct his attention to. He turned away from the Viszlas in the hall and towards the console display, radioing in the incoming transmission from Mos Eisley. 


""This is Mos Eisley tower. We are tracking you. Head for the outskirts."" 


""Copy that."" It was with a very heightened awareness of everyone's 
staring 
that he slipped into the pilot's chair, set the kid in his lap, gripped the throttle, and started easing the ship towards Tattooine. It had been a while since he'd flown anything the size of a frigate – Since Trask, actually. He could appreciate the irony.

""Looks like we'll be seeing Peli again, kid,"" Din muttered to Grogu, who was peering over the dash with something akin to awe.

“Your punishments are getting creative, Obi-Wan,” Knight Quinlan Vos commented idly, perched on a thick, low branch of a tree, back to the trunk. At the foot of said tree, Obi-Wan Kenobi pretended not to have heard him, sitting cross-legged in the grass, eyes closed and breathing evenly, the picture perfect of a Jedi meditating.A picture perfect broken by the little smirk on his lips. “Am I?” he asked evenly. “Why do you think my Padawan is being punished?”“Pull the other one, Obi-Wan,” Vos chuckled. “No Padawan – krifffing hell, no Jedi with any measure of common sense volunteer for temporary Creche Duty. So I’ll stand by what I said: very, very creative indeed. May I ask what your poor Padawan did to end up in this situation? Oooh, we got a runner here,” he whistled, watching a little Cathar Initiate run on all four toward a bush, only to get quickly intercepted and lifted off the ground by young Padawan Skywalker. “Oh, good reflex, but he should be careful, the pair of Twi’lek twins at the back are slipping away fast.”“Ha, yes, Ranya and Taaya,” Obi-Wan didn’t quite smile, but it was a near thing. “Master Larzul warned me about them. They’re both very curious and adventurous younglings; I’ve been told they managed to jury-rig the lift to go down the lower levels of the Temple despite not having an access card just last month.Quinlan threw his head back and laughed in earnest. “Oooooh, a pair of slicers in the making, eh? Kids after my own heart,” he put a hand over his chest in mock fondness.“But not after Anakin’s,” and this time there was no mistaking the smile in Obi-Wan’s voice, only reinforced by the loud cursing of young Anakin Skywalker as he realized he was about to become two Initiates short just in time to grab both kids by the collar of their tunics and yanked them back toward the rest of the group. “Hopefully he’s going to remember all the precise instructions Master Larzul gave him.”“And if he doesn’t?” Quinlan asked curiously.Obi-Wan opened an eye. “Then I suppose we’ll have to start a Temple-wide search for missing Initiates. It wouldn’t be the first time.”Quinlan snorted, remembering previous incidents. “Oh, Master Windu will love it. Though I suppose you didn’t just let your Padawan act as babysitter for the most, ah, ‘active’ Initiates Clan currently in the Creche without taking a few precautions?” Because he knew Obi-Wan; petty revenge or not, the redhead young man wasn’t about to let a child be deliberately endangered under his (distant) watch.“Of course not,” Obi-Wan nodded gayly. “I already warned the Temple’s Guards and gave them a list of all the children supposed to be under Anakin’s care for the day along with their pictures. They’ll know they’ll have to start a grid search the moment they see Anakin running around like a headless chicken.”“Such trust you have in your Padawan, it’s amazing,” Quinlan drawled.Now Obi-Wan opened both eyes, and his smile became grimmer. “What can I say? I was trusting him not to sneak out of the Temple to go participate in a rigged podrace with Dugs, and oh surprise, he still did – which somehow led to a speeder chase in the lower levels of Coruscant and me having to pick him up from a Judicial station at 2 bloody a.m in the morning. You’ll excuse me if I’m not feeling up to defend Anakin’s common sense right now.”Well, when put like this…“You’re still trusting him with kids,” Quinlan pointed out.Obi-Wan’s smirk grew. “No, I’m trusting him to learn how to be responsible after being run into the ground and being left a mental and physical mess at the end of the day after watching over what the Creche Masters all agree is the worst little menaces who ever passed in their hands.”“What, worse than us?” Quinlan raised an eyebrow, clearly insulted.“We didn’t make a habit of running away from the Creche completely naked after peeing on the rug all while claiming we were ‘free beings’, Quinlan,” Obi-Wan pointed out. “At least I certainly didn’t,” he gave the Kiffar a pointed look, because something not-so-different had happened once when they had still been in diapers. “We also never tried to smother each other with a pillow during nap time, or accidentally set our Creche Master’s cloak on fire, or used the Force to pickpocket the Guards, jury-rigged the lifts to go faster, offered a pilfered lightsaber to a baby to make their teeth on…”Quinlan actually blinked. “Wait, all that? And they’re what, five years standard top? Color me impressed! They might just beat our Clan’s record.” He looked at the group of Initiates Anakin was painfully corralling with new respect. As a former ‘little terror’ himself, he could only approve and encourage the new generation in their endeavor. “They’re going to be terrifying Jedi, aren’t they?”“Oh, definitely,” Obi-Wan nodded wisely.“Lucky for us we already have Padawans, eh?” Quinlan joked. Granted, said Padawans might have finished their formation by the time those particular Initiates were of proper age to become Padawans, buuuut… Nope, Quinlan wasn’t going to think about it.“Speaking off,” Obi-Wan looked up at him, “may I ask what you did with young Ayla? I do not think I saw her since we got her and Anakin back from that podrace.” Because of course Anakin hadn’t sneaked out alone; he had had a partner in crime and cheerleader all the way through.Quinlan waved dismissively. “Do not worry about my Padawan. All I’ll say is that she’s having just as much fun as yours right now, and she might even consider trading off if she was there.”“Now I’m the one who is impressed,” Obi-Wan commented as he turned back to observe Anakin.“Lhiac, no! Do not lick that frog! Put it back down in the fountain! Why is there even a frog here? No, Janik, we do not bite other people, even if we think the other person is a sleemo, and Aksem isn’t one! Taaya, Ranya, get back there immediately! Gaani, nooooo!” Anakin shouted, looking at wits end and ready to cry as used the Force to stop a little Bothan from falling from a fountain he had been climbing on. “That’s it: You’re grounded, you’re all grounded!”“Bad move,” Quinlan winced. “He’s going to regret it in short order.”You didn’t just ground a group of Force-sensitive kids, not unless you wanted them to get bored and/or revengeful about being stuck in one place and with all the other kids they may not like. Anakin Skywalker might have just signed his own death warrant, or at least his own sanity's own, and he didn’t even know it.Poor guy. Not growing in the Creche had left him with big blind spots, and the kids were going to be ruthless in exploiting them. Quinlan could see their calculating eyes from there, and he was torn between laughing his head off at Skywalker’s future misfortune or being a nice Jedi and just go pat the teenager’s shoulder and give him advices on how to survive an ill-behaved Clan.… Naw. He’d settle for a laugh.“Most likely,” Obi-Wan agreed, unconcerned. “It’ll be an excellent experience for him, I’m sure. Everyone needs to learn how to deal with young Force-Sensitives, after all.”“Yeah, the better to run away from them and let the job to a professional,” Quinlan shook his head and stretched, moving to straddle the branch. “You know your Padawan is never going to want to deal with kids ever again after that, right?”“If it makes him think twice about the risks of accidentally knocking up someone, I’ll be more than happy with it,” Obi-Wan mumbled under his breath. “I’m also hoping that threatening to volunteer him for Creche Duty any time he sneaks out again will be a good deterrent to his extra-curricular activities.”Quinlan tilted his head, watching as Anakin, proud boy that he was, looked ready to cry, even as a little Nautolean he was carrying in his arms gently tugged on his Padawan braid to try and comfort him. Sweet of him, but it only made Anakin sob harder.“Hmm, not sure if it will in the long term,” the Kiffar admitted, because he knew Obi-Wan’s Padawan, or at least he knew the type, “but I think you should be okay for the next six to eight months. Ten, if you’re lucky and he has to go for Round Two in under a month.”“Well, I suppose I’ll have to settle for that,” Obi-Wan sighed. “Tea in my quarters?” he proposed to his friend as he rose up, pretenses at meditation forgotten.“Lead the way, Obi,” the Kiffar saluted.

Summary:

Late night conversations.





Chapter Text
The room is still dark when Obi-Wan opens his eyes. He blinks and shifts on the bed, reaching out across the mattress: he finds himself alone. He huffs and closes his eyes again, rubbing his cheek against the cold, smooth fabric of his pillow.A second later, the door clicks. Cody’s back: Obi-Wan lets out a sigh and lets himself sink into the bed again, sleep lapping at the edges of his consciousness.He half-falls into a doze while he listens to Cody moving around the room. He’s quiet, quieter than most, but there’s something—off. He had plans for the night—he was meeting with some of the other commanders somewhere, and Obi-Wan had thought he wouldn’t see him until the next morning. They have the room for the next three nights: Obi-Wan will have to return to the Temple during the day, and Cody has his own plans, his own duties, and it’s stupid and reckless meeting like this. But it’s this or nothing, and Obi-Wan has found he has grown very tired of settling for nothing.Cody steps into the fresher. The light switches on once he closes the door, and Obi-Wan sighs in the grey dimness of the bedroom. A sliver of white slips through under the door, and slowly his eyes get used to it. He thinks about sitting up on the bed, but there’s something in the tense, blurry feelings that escape Cody’s tight shields that stops him. He’s buzzing with frustration, with something too bitter and grieving to be rage.Cody switches off the fresher light and steps back into the bedroom. He makes his way to the bed, bare feet padding noiselessly over the rug, and then he’s slipping under the blankets with a sigh. He smells of toothpaste. Obi-Wan blinks in the sudden dark. He closes his eyes. Cody’s weight makes the mattress dip, and Obi-Wan feels himself slowly drifting towards his commander. He’s lying on his side, his back to Obi-Wan, and he’s not asleep.Obi-Wan licks his lips. After a beat, he clears his throat and shifts across the bed, fitting himself to the firm line of Cody’s spine. He’s half-naked, wearing just his underwear and—and his socks. Obi-Wan huffs, stupidly amused, and tangles his legs with Cody’s.Cody tenses up minutely before relaxing again, and when Obi-Wan wraps his arm around his waist, Cody’s hand finds his wrist and then his hand, tucking it against Cody’s chest. Obi-Wan rubs his nose against the back of his neck and breathes him in: sweat, aftershave. Beer, bitter and still fresh. He’s very warm.“Did I wake you up,” Cody says. His voice is hoarse, and he sounds—off.“You’re back early,” Obi-Wan replies. Cody huffs.“So I did wake you up,” he sighs. He taps his fingers on the back of Obi-Wan’s hand. “Sorry.”Obi-Wan splays his hand on the centre of Cody’s chest and says nothing. He tucks his knees under Cody’s and lets himself relax against his body, steady and strong and present. He was meeting with his friends, and he’s back early, and he’s—angry, but the bright-hot bite Obi-Wan has learned to expect from his anger—always well-earned, always righteous—is missing.Obi-Wan can read between the lines just fine. He wants to ask: he isn’t that sure Cody wants him to. What they have and what he has with his brothers, with the other troopers—they’re very different things. The fact that Obi-Wan knows this unspoken, impassable boundary exists—the fact that he respects it, even if he doesn’t quite understand it—is one of the reasons Cody is in this bed with him.“I don’t want to talk about it,” Cody says suddenly. He clears his throat.Obi-Wan snorts softly. “I wasn’t going to ask,” he tells him quietly.Cody scoffs.“I can feel you thinking at me,” he replies, but it’s fond.Obi-Wan says nothing: there’s nothing to say. Cody already knows he cares, but letting the words bloom and take form implies a number of things Obi-Wan doesn’t quite want to deal with. Not yet, and maybe not ever.They fall quiet. Obi-Wan dozes, drifts closer to sleep. Cody shifts in the bed and resettles, his back against Obi-Wan’s chest. Very slowly, his muscles start losing some of their tension.“I said something I should not have said,” Cody says suddenly. He sounds very matter-of-fact. “It was true, and I was right, but I should not have said it.”Obi-Wan opens his eyes again. He keeps quiet, and feels his heart start beating harder, faster.“I will—apologise. Tomorrow,” Cody continues. Obi-Wan can picture the expression on his face: that half-grimace, dark brows furrowed slightly over his eyes. “But I think I—. I. I don’t know.”He falls quiet. Obi-Wan frowns slightly.Cody is—he’s so good. He’s clever and he’s good and he’s brave. Obi-Wan admires his mind and his humour and his unflinching sense of right and wrong, his loyalty to his people and to his own ideals. Cody is also prickly and impatient, and he can be a mean bastard. He’s blisteringly honest when it suits him, and ruthless, and shameless. He’s resolutely uncompromising, for better and for worse.For the first time in a while, Obi-Wan finds himself at a loss for words. He’s almost forty, and he knows himself quite well: he has never been very good at comforting people. And he doesn’t want to mess this up.Cody snorts. He starts laughing softly, and then he turns on the bed until he’s facing Obi-Wan, his silhouette a darker shadow in the dark of the room. One warm hand lands on Obi-Wan’s face, Cody’s rough thumb tracing the edge of his beard. Obi-Wan feels himself smile.“You’re very bad at this,” Cody tells him. He sounds almost—gleeful. His fondness warms the room, the space between them. Obi-Wan sniffs. “You always tell me I sound patronising.”Cody snorts.“That’s because you do,” he replies.Cody sighs. He shifts again, drifts lower. He lies his head on Obi-Wan’s arm to tuck himself under his chin, his curls soft against Obi-Wan’s lips. Obi-Wan tugs him closer and hums when he feels Cody’s fingers start moving across his back, not quite soft enough to tickle.“What do you want from me?” Obi-Wan asks after a while. He’s falling back asleep, but this is—this is important.After a while, Cody shrugs. “Nothing. I'll—I’ll fix this. F—he will forgive me, or he—won’t.”“He will.”Cody says nothing in reply. He sighs, and closes his eyes, eyelashes brushing Obi-Wan’s skin.This is very new. They've known each other for more than two years, but this—the bed, and the nearness, and the way Cody kisses his throat, lips soft—is so very new. It shouldn’t feel like this: it always catches Obi-Wan by surprise, the fact that it does.“Sorry I woke you up,” Cody says again, lips moving against Obi-Wan’s throat.Obi-Wan hums, already falling back asleep.  









Chapter 2: 2. night terrors
    


Summary:

Cody, Obi-Wan and an escape pod.



Notes:
Written for the Codywan Sleep Bingo. Card here.Pre-relationship, takes place during the war.




Chapter Text
The skin is red and bubbling: Obi-Wan can smell it, can hear it sizzle. Anakin yells soundlessly, lying face up on the narrow stretch of space between the escape pod’s controls and the bench. He arches his back, long legs kicking out and mouth open wide, the place where his arm used to be thumping loudly against the metal floor. Obi-Wan watches him. He wants to reach out, but can’t. He breathes in, breathes out: he reaches out within himself and finds nothing. Meanwhile, Anakin writhes and cries, the stump weeping blood and clear, liquid plasma, and Obi-Wan can’t hear him over the noise of what’s left of his arm hitting the floor, but he knows Anakin’s calling for him. Why wouldn’t he: isn’t Obi-Wan his master, isn’t Anakin Obi-Wan’s padawan? Didn’t he promise to protect and educate and train and raise the boy? The child, swimming in his learner robes, crying for help that never comes—what use are all the care and the love and the hours upon hours spent together.
He can’t move. Obi-Wan can’t move, and he doesn’t quite understand why, the only thing he wishes in the world right now is to be able to move, but he can’t, because he shouldn’t, and meanwhile Anakin cries and calls to him, and Obi-Wan can’t hear him but he won’t ever forget the crack in his voice and the pain and the fury and the rage, won’t ever forget that he let him suffer, and he should not, he should not, he should not, he will not.His mouth tastes of blood and ash. Obi-Wan straightens from his slump, blinking in the reddish dark of the escape pod. He rubs his lips with the back of his hand and makes a face when he smears blood and machine oil all over his beard.Cody’s watching him. He’s sitting on the bench, helmet lying carelessly between his feet on the ground. Shifty still sleeps, his head on Cody’s armourless thigh, face tucked against Cody’s belly. He’s bled through the bandages around the stump of his arm, and Obi-Wan blinks, shakes off what’s left of his dream. He’s already forgetting all about it: he can’t say he regrets letting it go. He feels shivery, shaky, and he knows it’s not just his exhaustion. He swallows, clearing his throat, and lifts his chin at Cody in question. His commander shrugs.He looks as tired as Obi-Wan feels. His left hand rests on Shifty, long fingers combing through the other soldier’s messy curls. It’s a shocking display of—something, and Obi-Wan doesn’t quite know why he finds it so surprising. He already knew his commander contained multitudes: he knew that from the start. Cody is clever, Cody has very little patience for most of Obi-Wan’s everything. Cody is a good liar and Cody doesn’t bother lying in the first place most of the time. Cody cradles his fellow soldier’s head in his lap, fingers gentle and careful while they disentangle the curls, and he watches Obi-Wan with dark, tired eyes, like he can see through Obi-Wan’s skull and into his head.The escape pod rattles. Thump thump thump: Obi-Wan shivers, bile climbing up his throat, sharp and bitter. He stays where he’s sitting on the floor and doesn’t check the autopilot. He can feel his men’s minds and souls all around him, floating away in the black, and he can feel the black itself, tugging at his mind, looking to widen the cracks.“Bad dream?”Cody’s voice is a hoarse, crackly thing. He makes a face at himself, and doesn’t clear his throat.Obi-Wan sighs. He smiles at his commander and makes himself look away from his commander’s hands. He thinks about lying; he decides not to.“Yes.”A beat. “Do you want to talk about it.”He sounds so—awkward. He makes a face: he’s exasperated, annoyed. Not with Obi-Wan, just with himself. Obi-Wan snorts. He feels the crack in his lip reopen and licks at the blood. “Not really,” he replies. “But it’s kind of you to ask.”Cody raises an unimpressed eyebrow at him and says nothing. Shifty sighs and whimpers in his sleep, and Cody’s face goes blank. He shushes the kid—because he is a kid; one of the newer troops, fresh off Kamino—and stills his hand, lies it flat on Shifty’s cheek.“He’s stable,” Obi-Wan reminds him. “He’ll make it.”
“Not with one arm. Sir.”Point taken. Obi-Wan looks away, down at his knees. He doesn’t need to look at Shifty to see his stump. To see—Obi-Wan blinks. He licks his lips, tastes blood. He smells: himself, sweat and ozone. Cody: sweat, blaster oil and blaster discharge. Shifty: more blood. It was a commando droid: the cut was clean, not quite surgical but enough for it to matter. 
He will live. He might—thrive. Cody will take care of it, because that is what he does: he takes care of things. He’s so very good at the mechanics of war that sometimes Obi-Wan finds himself forgetting the fact that his face, underneath the grime and the blood from the cut over his eyebrow, doesn’t look that much older than Shifty’s.Cody sighs. He looks down, lips pressed tight. He has nice hands. Long fingers. The sleeve of his undersuit is ragged and burnt and it doesn’t quite cover his wrist anymore: Obi-Wan catches a flash of paler brown, delicate veins straining against the thin skin, the bone round and barely there. His fingers are light on Shifty’s cheek, rubbing at the drying blood there, and Obi-Wan doesn’t dare moving, caught between the ragged remains of his half-forgotten dream and this awful, sudden longing for touch.Obi-Wan clears his throat again. He stands up, joints and back cracking and snapping, and doesn’t miss the way Cody twitches and stiffens, eyes wide with some unnamed emotion Obi-Wan very purposefully shields himself from.“Rest, commander,” he says, voice too loud, too much in the quiet of the small escape pod. “Sleep if you can. We have a long way ahead of us.”Cody stares up at him. He tilts his head slightly, and Obi-Wan finds himself smiling, a show of teeth: he has always felt like his good commander knows too much, sees too much. And Obi-Wan isn’t quite in the mood to let himself be understood.“Sir,” replies Cody after a while. He looks away, back at his sleeping brother. Obi-Wan sits on the pilot chair. He aimlessly makes sure that everything is exactly like he left it the last time he checked and then he just sits there, looking through his reflection on the viewport at the stars beyond. It’s so—cliché. In a way. One of his men loses an arm—Obi-Wan dreams of Anakin, and of Anakin losing an arm. Obi-Wan sighs, too tired and too empty to find the strength to laugh at himself, and closes his eyes again.









Chapter 3: 3. breakfast in bed
    


Summary:

Cody, Bly and Obi-Wan in the aftermath of battle.



Notes:
introducing: bly!!!!!!!!!!pre-relationship, takes place during the war.Bingo here.




Chapter Text
The cot is way too small for two, and one of the civvie medics keeps throwing dirty looks at them, but Cody has missed Bly and he almost got blown up, so he puts up with it. His brother is warm and steady at his side, his chest at the perfect height to lie his head on, and for once Bly seems more than happy to keep his mouth shut and just keep him company.
His shell lies on the floor right under the bed. Cody has a whole cubicle for himself, fabric walls and all, and he’s half-asleep, face tucked against his brother’s armpit, and Bly has the fingers of his free hand tucked right under his ear, the same way he always does.His heartbeat is slow and steady under Cody’s head. Cody keeps his eyes closed and listens to his brother’s breathing, to the rustle of his blacks over the rough medbay sheets, to Bly’s hums while he reads on his datapad. Now and then he grumbles something under his breath, fragments of disconnected thoughts and curses and short nonsense words, and it’s so—familiar. It’s like being back home, back on Kamino, comforting and safe and unexpected. It’s been a very long while since the last time Cody had the chance to spend time like this with any of the others—and he only had to get shot in the gut.He’s still tired and weak and shivery. He was told he spent a few days in a bacta tank, and he wouldn’t believe them except for the fact he can still smell the kriffing thing on himself. It’s on his hair and behind his ears and in the space behind his knees, and when Bly first hugged him he made a face, the sweet stink of rot obvious and cloying.At first he thinks the footsteps belong to one of the medics. He scowls, thinking they’re here to try and kick Bly out again, and then he feels the way his brother stiffens under his head. Bly is steady and stubborn and deceptively clever under his smiling façade of politeness. Cody has been trying and failing to get a raise out of him for the past twelve years: he can handle Cody’s medics just fine.“Oh. Apologies. I will—”What the heck.“No, sir, wait—”Bly shifts, trying to slip from under Cody; Cody pinches him as hard as he can in the thigh, and Bly’s leg twitches. When Cody opens his eyes, he finds his brother glaring at him, eyebrows raised. Cody rolls his eyes and turns his head to be able to look at the general.Kenobi looks like he tried to pick up a fight with a Seppie Lucrehulk and lost. He’s wearing clean robes, but the smell of machine oil and hot metal still follows him around, he has his right arm in a sling, and his left eye is so swollen Cody’s half-sure he can’t see anything from that side. 
When he realises Cody’s looking at him, he smiles winningly, wide and charming: it’s a bit like looking directly at the sun, bruises and eyebags and all, and by now Cody knows him well enough to know that Kenobi knows this. He has learned to weaponize his charm and his—face and his ease with words, and he has also learned to get used to the whole thing to work.Cody used to think it didn’t work on him: now he is not so sure.He has a canteen in his free hand. Cody tilts his head at it in curiosity, and Kenobi’s smile widens.“I am glad to see you awake, commander,” he says. He steps closer to the bed and stops by the foot of it. If he finds the fact that Cody’s using the commander of the 327th as a pillow strange, he doesn’t let it show. 
Cody clears his throat. “You look like hell. Sir.”Bly snorts. Cody goes to pinch him again, but Bly sees him coming: a warm, dry hand wraps around Cody’s wrist, and then stays.“You’re one to talk,” Bly says blandly. He has shed his previous awkwardness like it was never there, and Cody doesn’t have to see him to know how he’ll be looking at Kenobi.Kenobi laughs softly. He walks around the bed to leave the unassuming GAR-issue canteen in his left hand on the bedside table. He sees Cody’s curious glance and smirks down at him, his one functional eye warm.“A gift,” he says. He winks, or he tries to: his black eye doesn’t quite cooperate. He starts walking away. “Don’t let Hello catch you with that. I was never here.”And he leaves. Once his footsteps vanish into the everyday hum of the medbay, Bly snorts.“What a dick,” he says, unimpressed, like he’s not already reaching over Cody to grab the canteen off the wobbly table. He helps Cody shift and twist on the bed, dizzy and still hurting, until he can sit up against the pillow, half-leaning on his brother’s shoulder.
“What’s that?” Cody asks. “Please tell me it is caf.”Bly opens the cap: the smell of soup—of good soup, of the kind of soup one can only find in birther restaurants—fills the small cubicle.“Well,” Bly says. “It’s not caf.”They share it between them, passing the canteen every time the medics step away, finish it off slowly, and it’s so good—savoury and mild and warm. Cody falls back asleep on his brother, and when he wakes up again he’s alone, and he’s full and warm and almost comfortable, and he really needs to piss.

Cody and Obi-Wan in the aftermath of a mission.



Notes:
established relationship, takes place during the war. still early in their relationship. as always, bingo here.




Chapter Text
The room’s dark and quiet when Cody lets himself inside. Kenobi’s lying on his cot on his back, his blanket tangled around his legs and a slight frown on his face. The bruise on his cheek is closer to green than to yesterday’s purple, and the scrapes high up on his forehead have fresh stitches.He’ll be fine: he’s just bruised to hell and back, and the worst of it is on his front. Cody wasn’t there, too busy organising the retreat, but he’s read the reports, and he’s been on the other side often enough he can picture it just fine. It’s been a while since he got hurt this bad. It caught Cody by surprise: he was told the general lived, that he had left the field on his own two feet, but—but. Cody pauses in the middle of the room. Kenobi’s waking up, his fair lashes trembling. Maybe he should just leave: maybe he should just let him sleep. Maybe Cody should just go to sleep himself: he’s so tired he feels half-drunk, his limbs heavy. 
But he’s still jittery from the stims, and his mouth is dry, and he didn’t actually plan to come here, it just—happened.And then Kenobi opens his eyes and it’s way too late. He frowns at the ceiling of his bunk, groaning quietly, and then he shifts on the bed, like he’s thinking about sitting up. He pauses with a nasty curse, one of the ones in Huttese Skywalker’s so fond of.
Cody snorts and shakes his head. He moves closer, his armour out of place in the small, warm room, and when Kenobi twitches a hand in his direction he sighs and drops on the edge of the narrow cot.Kenobi has big hands, bigger than his, and they’re always very warm. It occurs to Cody that he wishes he had thought to take off his gloves before stepping inside, and then Kenobi finds the seam between his blacks and the gauntlet, slips dry fingertips until they rest against Cody’s palm, and fondness is sudden and awful and overwhelming. Cody clears his throat.“How’re the bruises?” he asks, keeping his voice low. Kenobi twists his head on the pillow to look at him, eyes glittering in the dark.
“The bruises are fine. Thriving, I’d say. Can’t say the same about me, however,” he replies. Cody snorts. “I have been told I will live.”
“Lucky you.”
“Yes. Lucky me.”Kenobi doesn’t believe in luck. If he’s being honest, Cody thinks he doesn’t either. He believes in fortune, and in coincidence, and in chance: he doesn’t believe in luck, either good or bad. “Everything alright? Retreat went well?”Cody hums. He shakes himself free and starts taking off the gauntlets, Kenobi’s eyes on his hands. He has a thing about hands, Kenobi. Or maybe just about Cody’s hands.The knowledge is—intoxicating. The certainty that Kenobi wants him. Sometimes, Kenobi looks at him the way he’s doing right now—eyes hot and heavy and focused, like Cody is some kind of celestial body and Kenobi’s caught in his orbit—and it makes Cody want to do something stupid, something reckless.Cody finishes with his gauntlets and leans down to kiss him, beard rough and soft at once against his lips. Kenobi tastes sour, and Cody knows that so does he, but when he licks into Kenobi’s mouth he sighs and shivers, his hands on Cody’s face, cradling his jaw, trying to pull him closer. Cody places one hand on his chest, pushes down carefully, and Kenobi gasps, shaky and hoarse and good, and when Cody leans away he finds the general staring at him, eyes on fire and mouth half open, skin flushed under the bruises and the freckles and the grime.Cody licks his lips. He feels hot and sweaty under his blacks, still in his armour.“You’re not supposed to move,” he says. His voice is shot: Kenobi shivers.
“Says who,” he replies. He smiles.They don’t do this. Sure, Cody’s fucked him a few times, one of them in one of the storage rooms of Secura’s Venator, but they don’t do this.The thing is: he wants to.Cody says nothing. He smiles back. Kenobi’s wearing just a thin shirt, and the skin of his chest feels so hot it burns through the fabric. “Yes,” Cody says. His thumb finds a nipple. He does nothing about it, just leaves it there, resting on the small bump of flesh, and doesn’t miss the way Kenobi shivers. “Retreat went well.”They lost a few squads. Acceptable losses, they’ll say. Cody blinks and puts the thought aside.Kenobi’s watching him. He wants to squirm, to move, Cody can see it in the nervous twitch of his fingers, but he’s keeping himself very still. “You see, general,” Cody says. He leans closer, closer, his weight pressing down carefully on Kenobi’s chest, his thumbnail catching on fabric and skin. “I’m very good at this.”Kenobi snorts. He’s half-laughing, half-groaning, and his hand is hot and heavy on the back of Cody’s neck. He leaves it there, doesn’t try to pull him closer, and Cody rewards him with a dry, caste kiss on his cheek. Kenobi smells of bacta and sweat and hot metal: Cody breathes him in, and something he doesn’t quite want to look at head on shifts and settles within his chest.He can feel it against his palm when Kenobi speaks, chest rumbling.“You’re a kriffing menace, commander mine,” he says. Cody lets himself smirk.
“Kamino’s finest, sir,” he drawls. Kenobi laughs again, ends up wheezing in pain, and Cody’s always known he’s not a very nice person, but he can’t find it in himself to feel bad about it.Cody kisses him one last time and moves away. Kenobi lets him go, his hand caressing the back of his neck, his jaw, resting on his throat for a beat before falling away. Cody swallows and grabs his gauntlets before making himself step away from the cot. Kenobi’s watching him sleepily, eyes bright with—something.“Goodnight, sir,” Cody says.He swallows. The bed’s too small for two: it wouldn’t work. Kenobi’s smile goes droopy and tiny, like he can see what Cody’s thinking. “Goodnight, Cody.”









Chapter 5: 5. king bed
    


Summary:

In Cody's bed, after the war.



Notes:
written for the codywan sleep bingo (card found here).aaand we're done. at least for the moment. this is kind of like an outtake of a different fic i'm working on at the moment (i wrote it specifically for the bingo and it won't be appearing in that other fic.)thanks again for the mods for organising the event ❤️




Chapter Text
The bed is a big slab of white cotton in the middle of the room. It is big enough that Cody can lie across on top of it, his feet barely brushing the edge, and it’s one of the most comfortable places he has had the chance to sleep in. 
He also hates it. It’s too big, too cold, too empty, too unprotected. The wide expanse of sheets and blankets make him feel alone, lonelier than he already feels. He did not choose it: it came with the room, and the room was one of the Senates many little backhanded gifts, like the clothes they kept throwing at him at first, like the first few drafts of the Clone Sentient Rights legislation. A poisoned gift, a gift that isn’t one—one of the first attempts on the new chancellor’s part at guessing Cody’s price.They now know better, but Cody’s stuck with the bed and the room and the apartment anyway, just because it is convenient and he has yet to see a single credit of the compensation they were all promised.Cody closes the door at his back and pads barefoot to his bed in the dark. It is a mess: it’s been a few days since the last time he even tried to put the sheets and blankets in some order, and half the few things he actually owns have ended up finding their way there. He can see his personal ‘pad, the comm he thought he had lost, yesterday’s socks, the cap of his old greys. He makes a face at it and then gives in to the inevitable, because he’s tired and he’s furious and he just wants to sleep.He should just leave. He knows it, and he thinks everyone does as well. The only reason he doesn’t is because by this point it has become a matter of pride: he stays out of spite.He forgot—again—to pull down the blinds on the room’s big window, and now and then the room flashes pink, yellow, green: Galactic City is just a layer of transparisteel away, always busy, always thrumming with life and death and industry and money. Cody leaves his clothes in a pile on the floor and pads until he stops in front of the window: it’s cold to the touch. He leans his forehead against it and closes his eyes, allowing himself a second to really feel how tired, how angry he is.At first the work helped with the latter: now it doesn’t, or not quite. Cody exhales, shaky with fury and frustration, exhausted to the bone, and then steps away and into the fresher. He showers in the big room, with its marble and its harsh white lights, and then he steps back out, the carpet soft against his soles and his wet hair dripping down his neck.And he finds he’s not alone.Obi-Wan has switched on the lamp on the bedside table. He’s moved most of Cody’s things to the chair in the corner, and remade the bed, more or less. He’s sitting on it, reading something in a datapad Cody recognises with a jolt as the one he used to own back in the war, and—“Is that food?” Cody blurts. Obi-Wan snorts and looks at him over the edge of his datapad. He looks good, tan and fit, hair closer to blond than it used to be.
“It is,” he says. He turns off his datapad and smiles crookedly. “The least I could do, since I let myself in and all that.”Cody snorts. He digs into his bag until he finds a pair of clean underwear, slips it on, and then he joins Obi-Wan on the bed, sitting cross legged across from him, the take out boxes between them. This—this: Obi-Wan appearing in the middle of the night with natborn food—started back in the war. Everything else might have changed, but Cody finds he likes knowing he can trust this won’t. 
He doesn’t always get it right—Cody will keep reminding him about the dumpling situation until he dies—but his choices are always interesting, and by now Cody knows that Obi-Wan knows that’s what he likes: natborn food is one of the few things that has yet to disappoint him.“Where’s this from?” Cody asks between bites. Obi-Wan shrugs. He’s mostly sipping a paper cup of caf, its aroma nothing like the sludge Cody remembers from the war, his free hand around Cody’s ankle. 
“I have no idea,” he replies honestly. “It’s from a cart a couple levels under this one, and they were too busy to ask.”Cody hums around a mouthful. He closes his eyes: the texture of the noodles reminds him of something he had in Felucia, a couple years ago, but the sauce is all wrong. And he has no idea what the protein actually is.“A mystery for the ages, then,” he says carelessly. Obi-Wan huffs. He left his boots and the outer layer of his tunic somewhere, and he looks soft and approachable like this, the dim light sliding down his bare arms.
“I’ll find out,” Obi-Wan replies. Cody hides his smile into his box. Of course he will.He doesn’t always stay. He doesn’t spend too much time on Coruscant anymore: the planet reminds Obi-Wan of things he’d rather forget. He left the Council a few months after the war ended, and while Cody very much doubts he won’t come back sooner rather than later, by now he’s more than happy to spend his time doing Prime knows what in the Rim.
They don’t talk much: Cody’s busy, and Obi-Wan keeps himself to the edges of the galaxy, far away from the reach of most comm relays, and he does it on purpose. But now and then, this: late night talks and weird food from the heart of the Republic and Obi-Wan’s warm hand around Cody’s ankle, heavy and reassuring. Obi-Wan in this bed Cody hates, in this room he loathes, and his tales, and his company.He’s not the only person Cody shares his body and his time with, but he’s the only one he invites into this bed, even if he doesn’t always stay, even if Cody wakes up alone more often than he’d like.Cody finishes one of the boxes, and then leaves the room to leave the other one in his glaringly empty conservator. He finds Obi-Wan in the fresher, brushing his teeth with the brush Cody keeps for him in the small cabinet under the sink, and he hip checks him out of the way to brush his own.
And then: the bed, huge and cold and still awful, and the beating of Obi-Wan's heart in his chest, under Cody’s ear, like a light in the dark."

The Rebels huddled in the designated cafeteria; the food too bland, the drinks too hot, the walls too white, and the seats too cold. On the rare day it wasn’t whiteout snowing on Hoth, they could turn on a radio and listen to the closest broadcast. 

“It is the twentieth anniversary of Queen Amidala’s tragic death. In memoriam of the Queen taken from us too soon, Queen Dalné has commissioned a bronze sarcophagus in the likeness of the late Naboo Queen. The sarcophagus is to be taken to Queen Amidala’s tomb in exact detail as the tragic Queen Amidala was taken to rest. The roads have been blocked off by Imperial troops as many people have flocked to the grave to catch a glimpse of the tragic Queen memorialized in bronze.” The announcer said.

“Dang. Do they do this for all monarchs?” Luke asked. 

“Only the hot ones.” Han said, blowing on his caff.

A sick feeling settled in Luke’s stomach; he had heard many men of many different species go on and on about the hotness of women but there was just a sickness that he felt whenever someone talked about the “hotness” of Leia and, now apparently, a dead Naboo Queen.

“Queen Amidala was beautiful?”

Han tapped on his datapad and pulled up a picture of the late queen.

She was very beautiful, she had soft brown eyes and a fierceness to her that reminded Luke of Leia. But she wasn’t hot. Or at least to Luke, she wasn’t. There was something about her that reminded him of someone, someone like Aunt Beru. There was a warmth to her that he recognized, her eyes seemed lively and… was it the flickering of the lights or did she have the same eye shape and color as Leia?


“Luke.”

 A faint voice echoed in his mind. A woman who was sad, who was in pain, who was dying. A voice that sounded like the faint trickling of water.


“Luke.”

 A warm, soft voice echoed in his mind. A woman he knew, who was warm, and as kind, and as fiery as her namesake. A voice that sounded like the mirages one Tatooine. 

Mom. This woman reminded Luke of his Aunt Beru, who was mom.

“See, I told you she’s hot.” Han said, smirking. 

“She’s not hot.” Luke said.

Silverware was dropped and at least someone choked on their caff. 

“Excuse you, Queen Amidala is… was the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. To say she’s not hot is just… just-” Wedge struggled for the right word.

“Blasphemy?” Hobbie suggested.

“Yes. Exactly.” 

“Look it’s not that I’m not saying she’s not beautiful, she is. She just… I don’t think she’s hot.” Luke shrugged. 

“Why not?” Han demanded. “How is this gorgeous, sexy woman not even on your radar?”

“For one, I am gay.” Luke raised an eyebrow. “Two, she just reminds me of my Aunt Beru. Aunt Beru is Mom and Queen Amidala just reminds me of my mom so in my mind she’s mom. My mom isn’t hot.” 

Luke’s mind immediately went to Aunt Beru’s smoldering body. 

“Luke, you and I know your Aunt was hot.” 

“She died the way she lived: smoking hot.” Luke said deadpanned and inwardly smirked as Biggs choked on his rations.

“Queen Amidala died pregnant so technically she could be classified as a MILF.” Sabine entered the cafeteria. 

“So you don’t think Queen Amidala is hot because she reminds you of your aunt?” Han said incredulously.

“Pretty much yeah.” Luke nodded. 

“Is that what you’re making a ruckus about? I could hear you all the way down in the command center.” Leia followed after Sabine. 

“Princess, please tell Farm Boy that Queen Amidala is hot.” Han turned on Leia. 

“Queen Amidala is beautiful but she is not hot.” Leia got her food and sat next to Sabine. 

“Princess, please,” Han begged in an exaggerated manner. 

“Look, I love looking at a beautiful, sexy woman as much as the next person but Queen Amidala isn’t hot. Beautiful, yes, but not hot.” Leia said.

“So you’re telling me, that if Amidala herself rose from the grave, and asked you if you wanted to make out, you wouldn’t do it?” Han asked. 

Leia was so disgusted by the thought that she gagged and almost vomited. 

Luke felt so physically ill at the thought and nearly barfed up his own meal. The Force shuddered at the thought and Luke didn’t know why, but he wasn’t going to question it. 

“You really don’t think she’s hot do you?” Han stared at the two. 

Luke and Leia held a silent conversation in a single look before they shrugged. 

“I think she’s hot.” Hobbie said.

“She could teach me about politics any day.” Mart said.

“Eh, I’m with the Wonder Twins over there.” Biggs called the two by the collective nickname the Alliance came up for them after discovering that they shared the same birthday. 

“Come on, Darklighter. Pilots stick together!” Han said.

“What’s this about pilots sticking together?” Hera entered with Jacen on her hip.

“We’re debating whether or not Queen Amidala is hot.” Sabine said. 

“Oh. Yeah, she’s hot.” Hera said nonchalantly. 

“See?” Han looked smug.

“No she isn’t. Hot and beautiful are two totally different things!” Sabine snapped, taking Leia’s side. 

“If Amidala wasn’t dead, I would treat that woman like the Queen she was.” Hera sat Jacen down next to Sabine and Leia. 

Sabine made a face and shuddered. 

“Aren’t you married to Mister I’m Not Dead But Everyone Acts Like He’s Dead?” Han questioned, debating whether or not this would cause Hera to change her mind and disagree with him like usual. Like the Ghost was a better ship than the Falcon… crazy Tail Head.

“I’m married, not blind. And I have two hands.” Hera got food for her and Jacen. 

“Okay, okay.” Mart stood up. “Raise your hands if Queen Amidala is hot.” 

Half the room raised their hands. 

“And raise your hands if she isn’t.”

The other half raised their hands.

“It’s split fifty fifty.” Mart sighed. “We need a tie breaker.” 

“On it.” Hera pulled out her comlink.

“Yes?” A deep voice asked. 

“Queen Amidala.” Hera said.

“What about her?” The man on the other line asked. 

“Is she hot?” Hera asked. 

The line went silent and the quiet cafeteria could faintly hear Admiral Akbar say “it’s a trap” to the man on the line. 

“Is this a test?”

“No, Love. Answer the question please.” 

“Will I end up sleeping on the couch?”

“Only if you say the wrong answer. Now is Queen Amidala hot or not?” Hera asked. 

“That’s not the question you should be asking. The question you should be asking is whether or not his mom was hot. Depa Billaba was a babe when she was-ACK!” 

Hera rolled her eyes at Cal’s contribution. 

“Thank you Kestis, that shall be tomorrow's debate. I would like an answer please.”

“I love you my dearest wife.” The man who wasn’t Kestis said.

“Is she hot, yes or no?”

“… what is the answer that is correct?” The man asked. 

“You’re of no use to me right now.” Hera ended the call. 

“So we’re still at a tie.” Sabine sighed. 

“What are we talking about? TIE fighters?” Rex has entered the cafeteria.

“Hot Shot and Princess don’t think Queen Amidala is hot. I say she is and we need a tie breaker.” Han said.

A thousand different emotions flickered in the old Clone’s eyes before he steeled himself with the thousands of battles won and lost, with the weight of surviving, with the loss of his brothers, his General, and his Lady before he answered. 

“Senator Amidala was the Lady of the GAR. Speak of her with the utmost respect or I’ll cut out your tongue.” Rex snarled. 

The cafeteria went silent. 

“I guess we’ll debate this another time.” Han muttered. 
 
Captain Piett didn’t happen to have a death wish, but that one coworker was driving him up the wall.

As he scrolled through his datapad, he found a news article about the late Queen Amidala and how she was going to be memorialized.

Piett glanced between his datapad and the back of Venka’s head.

It was no secret that Vader’s flagship was The Lady and Piett wasn’t stupid; he knew that Vader rose up the same time Anakin Skywalker had fallen. He knew of Vader’s injuries and that one holo he watched over and over.

He had to time it just right.

“Say, Venka, what are your thoughts on the late Queen of Naboo, Senator Amidala?” Piett asked as nonchalantly as he could. 

“Hotter than the fires of Mustafar. She was so hot. I wish sh-AHCKKK!”

Lord Vader didn’t raise his fist. 

He didn’t even breathe.

As Venka’s body fell to the floor, Piett looked back to his datapad. 

“Queen Amidala is being memorialized in bronze.” He said.

Vader said nothing as he continued on his way.

Piett didn’t blame him. 

After all, he wouldn’t want to talk about his dead wife either.

It was near the end of his shift when Piett received a set of orders. He groaned but quickly realized this was basically a glorified vacation away from incompetent idiots.


See to it that my Angel sleeps peacefully.


Piett sets his datapad down. He can pack later. 

///

“-now, since there are no questions of missions, squadrons, or strike teams, we must return to an important question.” The holotable displaying tactics, squads, and the plans vanished and in their place was a beautiful holo of a senator; her eyes were sad and her hair slicked back into a hair piece that looked like their symbol for the rebellion. Her fist was tucked under her chin in thought while her hand unconsciously caressed her stomach which, in retrospect, was obviously pregnant with her unborn child. “Is Padmé Amidala, Queen of Naboo, Senator in the Galactic Senate of the Republic… hot?”

Everyone in the briefing room groaned at the old argument. 

No matter how many times they had this debate, they were always at the same standstill: half the rebellion thought she was hot while the other hot said that while beautiful, she just wasn’t hot.

“Captain Solo,” Hera began.

“General.” Han smirked. 

“Captain of a piece of shit ship,” Hera said calmly. “We have had this debate so many times. So many in fact, that I have revoked my stance of supporting you in this argument.” 

“Just because I said the Falcon was superior-” 

“I assure you my Ghost is superior in her tech and her cleanliness. Senator Amidala isn’t hot.” Hera shrugged as she picked up her five year old son and placed him on her hip.

“Pretty!” Jacen said.

“See!” Han pointed at her.

“Pretty, not hot. Right?” Hera asked. 

“He’s a kid.” Han argued. 

“Not hot. Pretty.” Jacen said. 

“Thank you Lieutenant Meiloorun. I appreciate your support in this debate.” Leia smiled at a now shy five year old. 

“Oh come on. Dead man walking, back me up!” Han shouted. 

Kanan Jarrus didn’t have to see the look on Hera’s face to know she was giving him the Look. Kanan said nothing and crossed his arms.

The doors opened and Lando Calrissian walked in. 

“Sorry, I had to go relieve myself. What did I miss?” Lando asked before his eyes landed on the holo of Padmé Amidala. “Oh she is a beauty. A tragedy she died so young.” 

Han’s eyes lit up and then he smirked. “Hey pal, is Amidala hot?”

Lando raised an eyebrow and gazed across the room before back to Han. 

“Senator Amidala, was a work of art. A Queen, nay, a Goddess among us mortals. To simply describe such a woman with such a minute term as “hot” would be a disgrace. “Hot,” please. That woman was a force of nature. She was goodness and light and a bunch of other adjectives. She kept Emperor Palpatine at bay for years and for what? To be insulted by being called “hot?” No.” Lando felt the fear in him leave when he saw General Syndulla’s approving nod. “Queen Amidala, hot? Show her some damn respect.” 

Han’s jaw dropped. 

“Now that concludes this debate.” Mon Mothma took control of the following silence. “Go. Do your missions and may the Force be with us all.” 

Riyo stepped up to her old friend and simply gave her a look. 

Mon scoffed.

“Humor me?” Riyo asked.

“You and I both know that General Syndulla is the hottest woman in this rebellion. While very beautiful, Padmé doesn’t hold a candle.” Mon said.

“Oh to be that Spectre One.” Riyo sighed.

“Don’t you have a Fox?” Mon teased. 

“I have two hands.” Riyo shrugged."

Leia's reputation had taken a hit. Rumors had spread that she was homophobic, and it was all because of her disapproval of her son Ben's relationship with Snoke.
Ben Solo, also known as Kylo Ren, had been a rising star in Hollywood, with a string of successful movies under his belt. But when he had publicly announced that he was in a relationship with the notorious director Snoke, the media had gone into a frenzy.
The paparazzi had swarmed around Ben and Snoke everywhere they went, and the tabloids had speculated endlessly about their relationship. Some had even suggested that Snoke was using Ben for his own gain, and that the young actor was too blinded by love to see it.
Through it all, Leia had remained silent. She had always been a private person, and she had never interfered in her son's personal life. But when she had heard about the rumors that she was homophobic, she had been taken aback.
""I can't believe people are saying that about me,"" Leia had said to her husband Han, over the phone. ""I don't care who Ben loves. All I care about is his happiness.""
""I know, Leia,"" Han had said, his voice soothing. ""But you know how people can be. They'll always find something to criticize.""
Leia had sighed. ""I just wish people would understand that my disapproval of Snoke has nothing to do with his gender or sexuality. I just don't trust him. He gives me a bad feeling.""
Han had chuckled. ""Well, you've always had a strong sense of intuition. Maybe you're onto something.""
Leia had hung up feeling slightly better, but the rumors had continued to swirl. Even Ben had started to believe them.
""I don't get it, Mom,"" he had said to her during a phone call. ""You've always been so supportive of me, but now it seems like you don't accept who I am.""
Leia had been taken aback. ""Ben, I love you no matter what. You know that. But Snoke...I just don't trust him.""
Ben had sighed. ""Mom, you don't even know him. You're judging him based on rumors and speculation.""
Leia had been silent for a moment. ""I know, Ben. And I'm sorry. I just want you to be happy, and if Snoke makes you happy, then that's all that matters.""
But even as she had said those words, Leia couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that Snoke gave her. She had heard stories about him, about his cruelty and his manipulation. She didn't want Ben to get hurt.
One day, as Leia was walking down the street, she saw a group of protesters holding up signs that read ""Leia is a Homophobe"" and ""Love is Love, Leia.""
She felt her heart sink. She knew she couldn't change people's minds, but she couldn't bear the thought of being seen as someone who was against love and acceptance.
As she walked away, a young woman approached her. ""Excuse me, Mrs. Organa?"" she said timidly.
Leia turned to her. ""Yes?""
The woman hesitated. ""I just wanted to say...I don't believe the rumors. I think you're a hero, and you've done so much for the





Leia smiled gratefully at the young woman. ""Thank you. That means a lot to me.""
Leia thanked her again and continued on her way, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. She knew that she couldn't change everyone's minds, but she could continue to fight for what she believed in.
Meanwhile, Ben was struggling with his own demons. He loved Snoke, but he couldn't help feeling like something wasn't right. Snoke had been increasingly controlling, and he had started to isolate Ben from his friends and family.
One night, as Ben was lying in bed, he heard a knock on his door. He groaned and got up to answer it, assuming it was Snoke.
But when he opened the door, he was surprised to see his mother standing there.
""Mom?"" he said, surprised.
Leia smiled at him. ""Can I come in?""
Ben nodded and stepped aside, letting her into his apartment. They sat down on the couch, and Leia looked at him with concern.
""Ben, I'm worried about you,"" she said gently.
Ben rolled his eyes. ""Mom, I'm fine.""
Leia shook her head. ""No, you're not. I can see it in your eyes. Something's wrong.""
Ben hesitated for a moment, but then he sighed. ""It's Snoke. He's been...different, lately. More controlling. He doesn't want me to see my friends, or talk to you or Dad. He says it's because he loves me, but...""
Leia reached out and took his hand. ""Ben, that's not love. That's manipulation. You deserve someone who respects you, who trusts you, who doesn't try to control you.""
Ben looked down, feeling ashamed. ""I know. I just...I thought he loved me.""
Leia squeezed his hand. ""I love you, Ben. And your father loves you. And your friends love you. You have a whole support system that's here for you, no matter what. You don't have to do this alone.""
Ben looked up at her, tears in his eyes. ""Mom, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. I should have listened.""
Leia smiled at him. ""It's okay, Ben. We all make mistakes. The important thing is that we learn from them, and we try to do better.""
Together, they made a plan to get Ben away from Snoke and to seek help for his emotional trauma. Leia contacted her old friend, Dr. Aphra, who was a therapist and counselor, and arranged for Ben to see her.
Slowly but surely, Ben started to heal. He reconnected with his friends and family, and he started to work on his acting again. And he realized that he didn't need Snoke to be happy.
As for Leia, the rumors about her being homophobic eventually died down."

Chapter Text

INT. LOFT 3-5 - DAY
Boba, Fennec, and Din are seated on the couch while Peli sorts out the last of her moving boxes by her room’s door.BOBA
I don’t understand why you wanted
to be here for this interview. You
were supposed to have moved out
last week.PELI
I saw this guy’s application.
Looks pretty good! Compared to the
previous two, I think this one’s it.FENNEC
So why are you still here?PELI
If he’s gonna take my room, I
wanna see him for myself before I
go.Someone knocks on the door. Peli looks over at Din.PELI
Go get it.DIN
Why me?BOBA
Because the rest of us don’t want
to.Din sighs and gets up. He walks over to the door and opens it.DIN
Good morning—He cuts himself off when he sees the handsome man in front of him. A few years older than him with silver hair and hazel eyes, he is Cobb Vanth.COBB
Mornin’, partner. Cobb Vanth. I’m
here for the roommate interview.Din nods slowly, stepping aside to make room for him.DIN
Yeah. Come in.Cobb walks in. Din looks over at Peli who gives him a shit-eating grin. Din glares at her.COBB
Sorry, which one of you’s Din?DIN
That would be me.COBB
Ah. So you put the ad up. And
who’s the one leavin’?PELI
Me.COBB
Can I ask why?PELI
Movin’ in with a boyfriend.COBB
Oh, nice. Congrats.PELI
(about Cobb)
I like his manners.FENNEC
Would you have a seat?Cobb sits down in the chair across from the couch. Din sits back down beside Fennec and Boba. Peli stands by the side.BOBA
First question: Why are you
looking for an apartment with
roommates?COBB
I just broke up with my boyfriend.
We had a place together... We
decided to sell it and both move
out to make it fair.DIN
I’m sorry. It’s his loss.FENNEC
(pointedly)
You don’t know anything about him.
(to Cobb)
Why did you break up?DIN
You don’t have to answer that if
you don’t want to.COBB
No, it’s fine. He was just
really... I don’t know. Clingy.
Kept copying everythin’ I did.DIN
(to Fennec)
So I was right.BOBA
(looking at the application)
It says here you’re a preschool
teacher.This is news to Din. He didn’t look at any of the applications, only Boba did.DIN
It does?COBB
(sheepish)
Yeah, I work at that preschool
just a ten-minute drive away from
this apartment. The job is half
the reason I applied as a roommate
here. Perfect location.FENNEC
And the other half?COBB
Truth is, I don’t think I’m ready
to live on my own again yet. The
relationship lasted quite a while,
y’know. I’ve grown used to the
sounds of people creepin’ around
the apartment at night, wakin’ up
to a roommate showering before
leaving for work. You get it, right?DIN
I understand.
(Then:)
Personally, you seem like a good
fit.Cobb grins.COBB
Really?PELI
Hey. Apartment meeting in Boba’s
room.Fennec and Boba stand up and walk over.COBB
What’s going on?DIN
Just discussing your application.
We’ll be back in a few minutes.
Feel free to have a drink or a snack.COBB
(smiling)
Thanks for the hospitality.Din smiles and then makes his way to Boba’s room.
INT. BOBA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Din closes the door behind him, then turns to the other three.DIN
Between that annoying teenager
Toro Calican, the imposing Xi’an,
and tame preschool teacher Cobb,
it’s a clear choice.Peli, Fennec, and Boba exchange looks.PELI
You know you can’t sleep with him,
right?Din blinks - wasn’t expecting them to say that.DIN
I’m not going to sleep with him.Fennec stares at Din, unconvinced, then looks at Boba.FENNEC
He’s gonna sleep with him.DIN
(insistent)
I’m not.PELI
Please, just... don’t do it in my
old room.DIN
It’s gonna be Cobb’s new room,
though.PELI
Do whatever you want in your room!
Not mine!DIN
I’m not going to sleep with him.BOBA
Good. Remember our rule.DIN
(exasperated)
I’m not going to—FENNEC
(teasing)
You keep repeating yourself, Din.
Who are you trying to convince
here?Din glares at them.DIN
So do we agree or not? Peli moves
out tomorrow, rent is due in three
days, and it’s either him or one
of the other two options. And I
know you hated both of them.FENNEC
We agree.
INT. LOFT 3-5 - CONTINUOUS
Din, Fennec, Boba, and Peli reemerge. Cobb is on his phone, eating a power bar.BOBA
He is eating my last power bar.Cobb immediately stops chewing.COBB
(muffled)
I’m sorry.
(swallows, then:)
Sorry. I didn’t know it was your
last one.BOBA
You can clearly see it being the
last one when you pull it out of
the box. You can tell because it’s
empty when you removed the bar.Cobb is surprised.COBB
I guess I didn’t know you were so
intense about your power bars
either.FENNEC
One of the many rules you’re gonna
have to learn when you move in.COBB
(excitedly)
Did I make the cut?DIN
Yes.COBB
Oh, fantastic. When can I move in?PELI
Preferably in two days, ‘cause
rent’s due in three and it’s the
reason we got four people living
here, so.COBB
That’s fine, but I’m gonna need
help to get the stuff from my
old place.FENNEC
Din can go with you.DIN
What?FENNEC
(pointedly)
You have nothing on tomorrow.COBB
(to Din)
Would you?DIN
... Sure.Cobb claps his hands once, excited.COBB
Can I have your number?DIN
Excuse me?COBB
So I can call you and pick you up
tomorrow to go to my old place?DIN
Oh.
(pause, then:)
Yes.Fennec sighs loudly.
INT. COBB'S CAR - THE NEXT DAY
Cobb is driving with Din in the passenger seat. Country music plays quietly on the radio.DIN
I read your application after you
left. You’re from Texas?COBB
Born and raised, partner. But it’s
red and not in the way I like.
(gestures to his red shirt)
So once I was old enough, I moved
states. Got to Santa Clarita in
California. Dated a few guys, and
moved in with Scott — some little
place in San Diego. Now I’m
here... LA.DIN
How are you liking Los Angeles so
far?COBB
(shrugging)
Busy. Great food, great people,
and great weather. Can’t complain
too much. Your bars close early,
though.Din chuckles.DIN
We have a bar right below our
loft. Lucky for you, I work there
so it’s basically open whenever
I'm awake.COBB
You keep long hours?DIN
I don't knock off early.COBB
Perfect.The car rolls to a stop outside a small house.
EXT. COBB AND SCOTT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cobb frowns at the extra car.COBB
Damn. Scott’s here.Din stares at the car — Pontiac Aztec.DIN
He drives... that?COBB
Ugly, right? My God.Cobb shakes his head, parking by the sidewalk before getting out of the car. Din gets out with him.COBB
Fair warning: he can get really
jealous.DIN
You’re broken up, right?COBB
I wish that stopped him from being
jealous.Cobb knocks on the door. At Din’s raised eyebrow, Cobb raises his hands slightly.COBB
Handed my keys over when we broke
up. Thought it was a good idea at
the time.DIN
You did it for dramatic effect?COBB
(embarrassed)
Yep.The door opens — Scott. He seems happy to see Cobb, but his expression sours slightly when he notices Din there. Cobb sighs, the sound almost silent.SCOTT
Cobb. Hi.COBB
(forced smile)
Hey, Scott. Listen, I’m just here
to grab my things.SCOTT
Oh. You found a place?Cobb uses his thumb to point to Din.COBB
Moving in with this guy.Scott eyes Din. He crosses his arms and leans on the doorway, blocking them from entering the house.SCOTT
Really?Din realises Scott thinks Cobb had quickly moved on to him.DIN
Oh. We’re not dating.Cobb is annoyed by Scott stopping them from getting his belongings. He throws an arm around Din, pulling him into his side with a wide smile.COBB
Darlin’, I told you, you don’t
gotta sugarcoat it for Scott. He’s
a grown man. I’m sure he can
handle it.Din is speechless, not having expected this. Scott seethes slightly but moves aside to let Cobb and Din in.
INT. COBB AND SCOTT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Din looks around the house, seeing framed photos of Cobb and/or Scott on the walls or shelves. There are a few half-packed boxes belonging to Scott.SCOTT
(to Cobb)
I haven’t touched your stuff, so
you can take whatever’s yours.COBB
Thanks.Cobb picks up a sweater that was half out of a box.COBB
(confused)
This is mine.SCOTT
I bought that for you.COBB
Keywords: for me.SCOTT
But—DIN
Look, you gave it to him. It’s his
now. Let it go.SCOTT
You don’t have any involvement in
this.Din steps into his fake boyfriend role.DIN
I don’t want to fight you. My
boyfriend wants the shirt. You
bought it for him. Hand it over.Cobb smiles.SCOTT
I don’t get it. How did you move
on so quickly?Cobb tosses the sweater over his shoulder and grabs a book that belongs to him.COBB
Let’s be honest, Scott. This thing
between us hasn’t been what it
used to be for ages. I think we
were broken up months before we
actually did.Din takes down framed photos of only Cobb from the walls.SCOTT
Fine. But moving in with him
already?COBB
I’m being spontaneous.SCOTT
You found him on Craigslist,
didn’t you?COBB
No.DIN
Actually, it was Facebook
Marketplace.Cobb and Scott stare at him. Din sighs.DIN
I try to make a joke once.COBB
I liked the joke, darlin’.SCOTT
You didn’t even laugh.COBB
I laughed, you just didn’t see.
Stop being rude to him. You don’t
even know the guy.
(then:)
Why are you even still here
anyway? Your stuff’s more or less
packed. You got trouble finding a
place or what?SCOTT
It’s a nice place.Cobb pauses.COBB
What, are you saying you wanna
stay here?SCOTT
Maybe.COBB
We made a deal. Neither of us
keeps the place.SCOTT
Yeah, but it’s got good memories,
the location is good for me, and
what’s the point in both of us
moving out?COBB
The whole point of that agreement
was that we were both moving on
from this part of our lives!SCOTT
Can’t I move on and keep a nice
house?COBB
We both know moving on was never
your strong suit. And I’d actually
have liked to be part of that
conversation where you decided to
back out of our deal without
telling me.SCOTT
So your issue isn’t that I’m
keeping the house, it’s that I’m
staying here without telling you?DIN
(awkwardly)
I’ll go wait in the car.Cobb grabs Din’s arm to stop him.COBB
Nope.DIN
Or I can just stay here.COBB
Scott, I’m gonna need you to
listen very carefully to me. We’re
both supposed to move out of here.
You’re never gonna get over things
if you choose to stay here.
(gentler)
I’m telling you this out of care,
alright? Move out.Scott sighs.SCOTT
Fine, I will. I just need to find
someone who’ll sublet me a room...DIN
Maybe you can look on Facebook
Marketplace.Scott is unamused. Cobb can’t help but laugh.
EXT. COBB AND SCOTT'S HOUSE - EVENING
Din and Cobb put the last of Cobb’s things in the car’s trunk. Cobb shuts it and the two get into the car.
INT. COBB'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Cobb starts the engine.COBB
Thanks for helping me out today with my stuff.DIN
It’s my pleasure.
(pause)
Your boyfriend was more jealous
than I thought he was gonna be.Cobb snorts.COBB
Yeah. It was worse when we were
actually dating.Din winces.DIN
I see why you broke up.They begin driving away.COBB
So, what about you? Any exes? Are
you spoken for?DIN
I haven’t dated anyone in a while.
Some people here and there, but
never anything serious.COBB
Is it your preference or just
circumstance?DIN
Can’t quite find that someone, I
guess. Everyone I went out with
always had something I couldn’t
overlook.COBB
Ah, I get that. I’m sure you’ll
find someone. You’re a catch, far
as I can tell! Nice brown eyes,
handsome, willing to be someone’s
fake boyfriend to help him move
out of his jealous ex’s home...

They both chuckle.COBB
What’s your type? I used to help
wingman for my friends back in
Texas and San Diego. Could help
you out, too.DIN
You don’t have to.COBB
Come on, it’ll be fun! You guys
got a bar right downstairs, it’ll
be easy.DIN
Okay, okay.
(thoughtfully)
I don’t know... I guess I’d like
someone more outspoken than me.
Strong beliefs, but they can’t be
bad beliefs.COBB
Bad beliefs like?DIN
You came from a red state, I’m
sure you’re familiar with the
subject.COBB
Yep... Gotcha. What else?DIN
Respectful. Understanding. Being
great with kids is a plus.COBB
(smiling)
I’m guessing you want kids.DIN
I hope so, someday. It’d be good
to have a partner who feels the
same.COBB
So you’re thinking of settling
down, are you?DIN
I’m in my 30s. I don’t have to
settle down now, but I think it
should at least be in the cards.COBB
I get that.
(thinks, then:)
Sounds doable. Din Djarin, I am
gonna find you the person of your
dreams.Din smiles.DIN
What about you?COBB
My type?
(thoughtfully)
After the relationships I’ve had,
I think I’m ready for something
different.DIN
What’s different?COBB
Something slower. More real. A guy
that doesn’t just see me as a
trophy. I want... I don’t know, I
guess I want a guy who’s down to
earth, who actually wants to know
about my day when he asks.DIN
Maybe you can check Facebook
Marketplace.COBB
For the love of...
(bursts out laughing)
What’s with you and Facebook
Marketplace?DIN
I saw Boba using it once to sell a
rocking chair and it’s been stuck
on my mind ever since.COBB
In your defence, it’s a suspicious
version of Craigslist.DIN
(seriously)
Okay, but I hope you find that. I
know we’ve only been friends for a
day, but I think you’re a good guy
so far. You deserve someone who
treats you better.Cobb smiles, touched.COBB
Thanks. You, too.
INT. LOFT 3-5 - NIGHT
Din and Cobb quietly close the door behind them, all of Cobb’s things having been brought upstairs. Fennec and Boba are at the bar and Peli’s boxes are already gone.Din walks over to the fridge and sees a note left in Peli’s handwriting, held by a magnet of a cartoon wrench: “Din: Left while you were gone. Call me in the morning. Peli”.DIN
Peli’s gone.COBB
Don’t say it like that. You make
it sound like she died.DIN
Sorry. Peli moved out.Cobb smiles, amused.COBB
So, I haven’t seen my room.DIN
Come on, I’ll show you.
INT. PELI’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Din opens the door and turns on the light switch. The room is empty, with only Peli’s bed frame and mattress left behind. The walls are painted maroon.DIN
Peli painted it a few weeks ago
‘cause she wanted the new roommate
to have a fresh room. If you don’t
like the colour, we can repaint it
with a different one.COBB
No, I love it.DIN
Perfect.There’s a pause as Cobb looks around the room, imagining where his items will go and what furniture to get.DIN
I can help you get your bed set up
so you can sleep.COBB
Ah, you already helped me with
moving my things. I can handle the
bed on my own.DIN
At least let me help move your
boxes in here. I’d let you leave
them in the living room but Boba
hates it when there are boxes just
lying around.COBB
Yeah, I noticed he was a little
put off by Peli’s.
(gratefully)
I’d like that.The two of them move Cobb’s boxes into his room, then Din leans against the wall as Cobb puts his bedsheets on the mattress.COBB
You know, I didn’t expect you to
be so nice.DIN
Why not?COBB
Well, being 30 with three
roommates is easily any modern
person’s nightmare.DIN
(amused)
I see your point.COBB
But I was looking at these kinds
of ads specifically ‘cause I
wanted more company and I figure
rent will be more affordable if
it’s split more ways. I don’t make
much as a teacher.DIN
That makes sense.COBB
I went to see about this other
place with four other roommates
but they were like... frat boys.
I don’t need them screaming at 3 in
the morning while I’m sorting
lesson plans.DIN
You don’t have to worry about that
here. Boba doesn’t tend to stay up
late, Fennec’s usually out at
night, and I work nights at the
bar. You’ll be able to work in
peace.Cobb finishes putting his bedsheets on and sits down on the edge of the bed, looking over at Din.COBB
Again, thanks for all your help
today.DIN
And again, it’s my pleasure.COBB
So... any rules I should know?DIN
Not a rule, but you should
probably restock Boba’s power bars
before he wakes up tomorrow.
There’s a 7-11 nearby.COBB
Right, I’ll go later.DIN
I should probably warn you about
how Boba and Fennec met. Peli—
Fennec met to get a car fixed.
Peli's a mechanic.COBB
How’d they meet?DIN
They’re bounty hunters.Cobb stares at him.COBB
What, like... as in they kill
people for money?DIN
(quickly)
No! They work for bail bonds. They
capture people who run from their
legal trials.COBB
(relieved)
Oh. Oh, my God. Okay. You had me
going there.DIN
Sorry. I should have been more
clear.COBB
I’ve been watching too many action
movies, obviously. But is there a
rule attached to this?DIN
Yeah. Boba and Fennec met like
that, but only Fennec still works
in that field. Her rule is to
never ask her about her hunting
job.COBB
Easy. What’s Boba workin’ as?DIN
Manager of Facebook Marketplace.Cobb bursts out laughing.COBB
Please tell me you’re just fucking
with me.DIN
(grinning)
I saw a chance.COBB
What does he actually work as?DIN
Manager at Mos Espa Hotel.COBB
A hotel manager, a bounty hunter,
a mechanic, and a bartender. What
an odd bunch of friends.DIN
And now a preschool teacher.COBB
God, I’m going to look insane.Din smiles and then moves to the doorway.DIN
Well, it’s late. I have to get to
the bar. I’ll see you in the
morning.COBB
Have a good time at work.
INT. MANDALORE BAR - LATER
Din enters the bar from the employees’ only entrance. Bo-Katan Kryze is there - the manager.BO-KATAN
Din, finally. Listen, Axe called
in sick so you have to cover his
shift.DIN
You just told me this.BO-KATAN
I know. If I could find another
bartender to take over, I wouldn’t
put this on you. I’ll be on the
lookout to hire a new one but for
now, do me a solid.DIN
I don’t know, you warned me last
minute.Bo-Katan gives him a flat look.BO-KATAN
I’ll let you call out and have Axe
cover you next time.DIN
Deal.Din exits the back room into the main bar. Fennec and Boba are seated at the bar, drinking. They see him and smile as he walks over.FENNEC
So how was the trip with Cobb?Someone orders a gin and tonic and Din talks as he prepares the drink.DIN
We get along well. His ex-
boyfriend is annoying.Boba gives Fennec $10. Din stares at them.DIN
What did you bet on?BOBA
Fennec bet you’d get annoyed by
the boyfriend.DIN
(pointedly)
I met Cobb yesterday.FENNEC
I’m joking, Din. I’m just teasing
you. He’s a handsome guy. From the
sound of it, seems nice. And you
happen to be a romantic.DIN
I’m not. I’m not the kind of guy
who runs through an airport. No
declarations in the rain. I don’t
even kiss on the first date.BOBA
The night’s still young. Besides,
we’re only kidding around.Din rolls his eyes.DIN
Sure, you are. You’ve been on me
about him since he walked in the
door like the supporting
characters in a rom-com.FENNEC
(grinning)
It’s funny for me.DIN
(sarcastically)
I hope you’re enjoying yourself.BOBA
There are worse places to find
someone than Craigslist.DIN
Yeah, like Facebook Marketplace.Boba glares at Din who serves the gin and tonic, laughing to himself.

Din gives Cobb a ride to work which results in some misunderstandings. Jo tells Cobb about the Motorbike Rule. Din's nephew visits.





Chapter Text

INT. LOFT 3-5 - MORNING
Cobb comes out of his room dressed for work with a small bag. He looks around the main room, seeing Fennec haul a large black bag over her shoulder as she makes her way to the door. Boba has a briefcase, dressed in his uniform. Din is in a grey shirt, drinking coffee.COBBMy car’s out of fuel. Can someonegive me a ride to school?Fennec gives him an apologetic look as she grabs her car keys.FENNECSorry, can’t. I’m taking mine outof state.BOBAFennec’s dropping me off at thehotel and it’s nowhere near yourschool.COBBDamn. Din?DINI can take you.COBB(relieved)You’re a lifesaver.

Din has on a leather jacket while Cobb has a bag with his work supplies, dressed in a maroon blazer. Din tosses Cobb a green and red helmet while he puts on a silver one. Cobb stares at it, following Din.COBB(hesitant)You drive a car, right?DINNope. Motorbike. Hop on.Din gets on the front seat of the motorbike and sees Cobb lingering behind.DINWhat’s wrong?COBBI, uh. I’ve never ridden amotorbike before.DINDon’t worry. It’ll be fiveminutes, tops.(teasingly)You can hold on to me.Cobb glares at him but gets on the motorbike behind him. He holds onto Din’s shoulders. Din starts the engine.DINReady?COBB(nervously)Yeah.
EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS
Din’s motorbike comes out on the road, going past cars. Cobb’s hands go from Din’s shoulders to wrap around his waist. He buries his helmeted face in the crook of Din’s neck.DINAre you okay?COBB(unconvincingly)‘M fine.DINHold on tight.Cobb tightens his hold on Din’s waist, pressing his body as close to Din’s back as possible. Din smiles under his helmet.
EXT. FREETOWN PRESCHOOL - LATER
Din pulls to a stop outside the preschool. When he realises Cobb isn’t making any move to let him go, he gently pats Cobb’s hands around his waist.DINWe’re here.Cobb straightens up, blinking in disorientation as he looks around. He’s indeed at school. He takes the helmet off and ruffles his helmet hair.COBBOh.Din reaches up to Cobb’s hair.DINSorry, the helmet messed up yourhair. I’ll help.Din adjusts Cobb’s hair to look like how it did before he put the helmet on. Cobb watches him, unable to look away. Once satisfied, Din pulls his hand back.DINDone. Have fun at school today, MrVanth.COBB(absently)Actually, the kids call me MrCobb.DIN(smiling)Well, then I’ll see you at home,Mr Cobb.Din restarts the motorbike’s engine and waves goodbye to Cobb before taking off. Cobb watches him go. One of the students comes up to him.STUDENTMr Cobb, is that your boyfriend?COBBHuh? What? Pfft.

Give me a second.Din presses ‘9’ on his phone.COBB (O.S.)Thanks. I’m comin’ up.Din hangs up and takes his hand off of Grogu’s head. He goes to buzz Cobb in. Grogu follows Din to the front door, watching him unlock it.A few moments later, Cobb appears at the door. He doesn’t see Grogu at first, greeting Din with a smile.COBBHey. Thanks for the lift thismorning. You made quite the stirat school.DINDid I?COBBOh, yeah.

INT. MANDALORE BAR - NIGHT
Cobb walks into the bar, his first time there. Din is busy pouring drinks for some girls and entertaining them, so Cobb sits at the other end of the bar to leave him to work. Koska Reeves, another bartender, walks over with an empty glass.KOSKAWhat can I do you for?COBBJust beer’s fine.KOSKASure thing.She pours him a glass, watching him with a careful eye.KOSKAYou look like you got something onyour mind, pal.COBBWondering about this thing myfriend told me about, somemotorbike rule.KOSKAWhat’s this motorbike rule?COBBNo dating people with motorbikesbecause they’re shady as hell.(chuckles)I don’t even really believe that.My friend Jo, her girlfriendthinks that because all themotorbike riders she’s met areshady. But they're young, so.KOSKAWell, you and I have lived longerthan this Jo kid, and ifanything... motorbikes just meanthey’re fast-paced, adventurous,and confident.COBBDoesn’t sound like him.KOSKAOr it can mean he’s very carefuland level-headed.COBBNow that sounds more like him.KOSKALooks to me like you’re thinkingabout this so much because you’reconsidering asking this roommateout on a date.COBBI don’t know. Is he handsome?Yeah. Nice? Probably one of thenicest people I’ll ever meet.Great with kids, which is a plus.But I don’t know, it’s so soon. Wemet a few days ago and I’ve onlyjust gotten out of a long-termrelationship.KOSKAI hear you. Axe over there--(nods towards Axe Woves)--asked a girl out on a date thefirst time they met. A week later,she’s keyed his car and stolen hisBon Jovi CDs.COBBWhy his Bon Jovi CDs?KOSKAMaybe she’s really into Bon Jovi.Man, how should I know? Anyway, Iget it. Sometimes, jumping intothings so quickly isn’t the bestchoice.COBBExactly.KOSKABut.COBBBut?KOSKAOne time, I went to a bar. Therewas a drunken old guy hitting on alady there and she was not havingit. He just wouldn’t leave heralone. Then this other womanshowed up, grabbed a fistful ofhis jacket, and hauled him to thefloor. Told him to get the hellout or she’ll show him what elseshe can do. I asked her on a dateimmediately after she chased theguy out.COBB(surprised)And how did that end?Koska raises up her hand with a smile, revealing an engagement ring.KOSKANow I’m engaged to the woman whoruns this bar.(lowers her hand)The point is, it can go well or itcan end horribly. You’re not gonnaknow until you give it a shot. Butif you want my opinion, this dudesounds like he’s worth the try.Right? At least, sounds like hechecks off your boxes so far.Cobb glances over at Din and sighs. The girls he’s tending to are charmed by his bartending skills, and Din is too occupied in his work to look at Cobb. Cobb turns his attention back to Koska.COBBI guess.KOSKAHey. No matter what you do... Fuckthat motorbike rule. Who cares ifhe drives a motorbike? Romanceisn’t about rules, and it sure asshit isn’t about rules made by abunch of 20-somethings who dated aDJ and think they know it all.COBBYeah, you’re right.(a beat, then:)Motorcycles are scary as hell.KOSKAFirst time rides can be like that.COBBBut also kinda... sexy?KOSKA(Grinning)Damn right.

Cheaper than therapy.
INT. LOFT 3-5 - DAWN
Din quietly reenters the loft, putting his shoes aside. He yawns, locking the door behind him. He looks over at the couch where Grogu and Cobb have fallen asleep on the couch. Whatever movie that was playing on the TV has long ended, but the DVD case on the coffee table makes it clear that they were watching Toy Story.Din smiles at the sight and grabs Cobb’s blanket from his room. He brings it over and gently drapes it over their bodies. Cobb rouses awake and looks up at Din through bleary eyes.They both whisper to not wake Grogu.COBBHey. How was work?DINGood. I saw you but I didn’t havetime to come over. Sorry.COBBDon’t worry ‘bout it. What’s thetime?DINThere’s no school today. It’s theweekend.Cobb sighs.COBBI forgot.DINSleep in.

Cobb falls back asleep almost instantly, and Din smiles fondly.

She gives Din two thumbs up, before gesturing for him to pay attention to Cobb. Din resists the urge to roll his eyes, but he sighs anyway.COBBI thought Peli wanted to get toknow me. Turns out she just wantsto set me up, huh?DINLook, I apologise for that. Myfriends meddle sometimes—moretimes than they should.COBBRelax. I get it. My friendsmeddle, too.

Boba walks up to Fennec, following the address she’d texted him, and sees the wrecked bike in front of them. Fennec has one hand covering her mouth as she stares at the bike, wide-eyed.BOBAWhat did you do?FENNECI was chasing a bounty who waslast seen on a bike. I figured abike would up my chances ofcatching him, so I borrowed it.Then the bounty did an expertmanoeuvre I couldn’t keep up with.BOBAAnd then?FENNEC... then I crashed it into a tree.Boba is speechless.BOBAWell, are you alright?FENNECArm’s a bit sore.

Cobb closes the door behind himself and Peli, then turns to her.COBBWhy the hell did you do that? You’re the one who set this up.Peli considers coming clean, but figures that he would tell Din about the motorbike.PELII mean, I just thought about whatBoba said before... like, if thisthing doesn’t work out, what areyou gonna do? This place is in aprime spot for you work-wise,right? A different state from yourlast ex, too. Those are thereasons you picked this place. Ifyou break up with Din, he sure ashell ain’t gonna be the one tomove out.

He’ll say he ain’tthe type to run through theairport for someone. He never has,too. But I know he cravessomething like that. If this thingwith you didn’t work out, it’llcrush him. And if I assume thingsabout you correctly, it’ll crushyou, too.Cobb sighs; he sees her point.COBBI guess so.PELII’m sorry, Cobb.COBBDon’t apologise to me. I get it.But you should apologise to Din ifhe’s the romantic you say he is.Peli widens her eyes—she hates sensitive confrontations.PELII actually need to go check onsomething.COBBPeli, I know we don’t know eachother well yet so I’m gonna trynot to overstep when I say youmade him have a date he didn’twant and then told him he couldn’tgo on another when he did want it.Peli cringes in frustration.PELIYeah. I’ll, uh... I’ll call him.I’m sorry.Peli quickly leaves the loft.
INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Peli sees Fennec and Boba bring back a brand-new bike.PELIDid you fix it or is it new?FENNECMy contact couldn’t fix it, andwouldn’t try. I found the samemodel and Boba went looking forthe right sticker.Fennec bends down with Peli, showing her the sticker. It’s been properly weathered and looks as aged as the original. The bike itself looks weathered enough to be believable as the original bike.BOBAWe managed to salvage the originalplate, so the number’s the same.Peli nods, satisfied. The bike looks like before.PELISorry I couldn’t help fix it. Youknow I only really work on carsand trucks.FENNECIt’s fine.BOBAThank you for making sure Dindidn’t find out.PELIYou both owe me big time for this,and I mean it. I tore down somebig plans just to keep this secret.BOBADid you try to matchmake Din andCobb?PELI(unconvincingly)No.BOBA(exasperated)I warned you.PELIListen, I stopped them from goingon a little joyride on his bike foryou! Din’s mad at me now ‘causeit’s like I was toyin’ with him,making him go on a date withCobb and then telling him theyjust wouldn’t be a good match.Boba is about to defend himself and Fennec. Fennec interrupts him.FENNECAlright, we owe you. Thank you,Peli.PELII’ll call him tomorrow morning,but I seriously gotta get going. Igot work.BOBAText me when you’re home safe.PELIWill do. Let me know if Din’sstill mad once he’s home from thebar.Fennec gives her a thumbs up and Peli makes her leave.
INT. MANDALORE BAR - LATER
Din is cleaning a glass. Most of the patrons have been served and Koska is entertaining a group of friends on the other end of the bar.Cobb looks at him from the booth: Din doesn’t notice him, overly engrossed in his work as he avoids thinking about Peli’s words from earlier.Cobb looks down at his phone. He’s on the call app, with Scott’s number pulled up.He sighs, glancing between Din and his screen.

Cobb is asleep in his room. Fennec bends down in front of his bed.FENNEC(whispering)Cobb. Hey.Fennec pokes his foot. Cobb doesn’t budge.BOBAJust wake him up.Fennec loudly shushes Boba. Cobb stirs slightly but still does not wake.BOBAIronically your best attempt atwaking him yet.FENNEC(to Boba)Shut up.(whispering)Cobb. Wake up.Finally, Fennec gives in and smacks Cobb’s head. He jolts awake and almost rolls off his bed, saving himself at the last second by clinging desperately to his sheets.Cobb looks over and sees Boba and Fennec looming over him.COBBWhat the hell are you doing?!FENNEC(whispering)Keep your voice down.COBB(whispering)Why?FENNEC(whispering)Today is Din’s birthday.BOBA(whispering)Fennec and I are planning a partyfor him. You’re invited.Cobb stares at both of them.COBB(whispering)Was I supposed to assume I wasn’t?BOBA(whispering)You’re in charge of guests.COBB(whispering)So you weren’t gonna automaticallyinvite me with my roommate status,and now you’re gonna give me partyduties?FENNEC(whispering)We assumed you’d want Din to havea good party. Were we wrong?COBB(quickly)No, I do.(whispering)How many guests am I supposed toget?FENNEC(whispering)You can pick a number you think isbest. You can ask the neighbourson this floor, Din knows them.COBB(whispering)You’ve known Din longer than I do!How do you not have a list offriends I can call to invite?BOBA(whispering)Okay, fine. I will handle guests.You can settle the cake, yes?COBB(whispering)That, I can do. What does he like?FENNEC(whispering)Chocolate.BOBA(whispering)I thought he liked red velvet.Fennec stares at him, then shakes her head slowly in disapproval.FENNEC(whispering)L friend.BOBA(whispering)What the hell does that mean?FENNEC(to Cobb, whispering)You do the cake, Boba handles theguests, and I’ll do the presents.The Mandalore bartenders agreed todo the location and decorations.Both of you text me what you wantto get for Din and I’ll take careof it. Listen, Din’s had a lot ofbad birthdays. This is the firstone with you there. Maybe you’llbe his good luck charm this time.Fennec moves to leave Cobb’s room. Boba follows her.BOBA(whispering)Wait, what is “L friend”? Fennec.Once they’re gone, Cobb sighs and lies back down.
INT. GHOST CAFE - AFTERNOON
Cobb is staring at his phone as his best friend Issa-Or approaches him with two coffees. She puts one down in front of him as she sits across from him in the booth.ISSA-ORWhat’re you looking at over there?Cobb turns the phone around to show her Scott’s contact. Issa-Or snatches his phone.COBBHey! Give it.ISSA-ORLook, we talked about this! Whyhaven’t you deleted his number?COBBWell, a while back, someone talkedsome sense into me.ISSA-ORIf their advice was to go back toyour clingy ex, then it wasn’tmuch sense at all. Why did youcall him? What did you say?COBBWill you relax? I didn’t call himalright? I’ve just been thinkingabout it.ISSA-ORDidn’t you tell me he’s stillliving in your old home like acreep?COBBHe texted me two weeks ago thathe’s moved out and in with afriend.ISSA-ORHe’s lying.COBBHow do you know?ISSA-ORHe doesn’t have friends, Cobb!Cobb sighs and rubs a hand over his face.COBBI just... you know the roommate Itold you about? Din?Issa-Or is suddenly more interested in the conversation.ISSA-OR(cheekily)The handsome bartender?Cobb rolls his eyes.COBBYeah.ISSA-ORYou were thinking about asking himout, right? Well? Why’re youthinking about Scott, then?COBBBecause someone else convinced meit was a bad idea. I mean, the magicor whatever with Scott probably dieda long time ago, but we did date forfour years. It’s a long time; maybe Ihaven’t really registered it.(beat)Besides that... Din wants somethingreal. And I don’t know if I’m what heneeds, or wants. And if I’m not, thenit’ll mess up our friendship andliving situation.Issa-Or is quiet for a while as she listens to Cobb’s explanation.ISSA-ORWow. Okay.(beat)I’ll tell you what, though. You’veknown this Din for about a month,and already he’s made you a bitmore like the person you alwayswanted to be.COBBLike?ISSA-ORSomeone who thinks with his brainmore than his impulse.Cobb chuckles humourlessly and sips his coffee.COBBYeah. Not great for me. I’d loveto keep being the stupid bastardthat doesn’t care how awkward itis to reach for the same coffeecup as a roommate after screwinghim the night before.ISSA-OR(sarcastically)So gentlemanly.COBBI am a gentleman.ISSA-ORSure. A real gentleman would makehis partner some breakfast in bedinstead of making him get up toget stale coffee.COBBFine. Boba and Fennec are hostinga birthday party for Din tonight.You’ll be my plus one. I’ll showyou how much of a gentleman I am.Issa-Or laughs.ISSA-ORSure. I’d love to meet the guywho’s got you so crazy.COBBI am not crazy!(beat)I am a tall man with feelings.ISSA-OR(spooky voice)Oh... tall man with feelings...COBBOh, fuck off.Cobb pulls out his phone. Issa-Or raises an eyebrow.ISSA-ORWhat’s first on your Gentleman’sAgenda?COBBGetting his beloved nephew attonight’s party at all costs.

Issa-Or smiles slightly.KUIILNot many would go through thetrouble of bringing one’sfavourite nephew and such ameaningful present to a birthdaycelebration just to make themsmile... and for nothing inreturn.COBBLots of people do things to makepeople smile without any rewards.Like Fennec and Boba planned theparty. They convinced thebartenders to set up the location.KUIIL(pointedly)And not one of them thought aboutinviting Grogu or seeking thisout.That is true—Cobb shuts up.KUIILI have spoken.Kuiil waves goodbye to Grogu before getting back into his car.

Cobb brings a small cup of hot chocolate to Grogu, putting down two taller cups of coffee for himself and Issa-Or. Grogu sits between them in a booth, blowing on his hot drink.COBBHappy with your drink?GROGUMhm. Thank you, Uncle Cobb.Cobb mouths “Uncle Cobb” to Issa-Or, feigning a swoon. Issa-Or rolls her eyes.COBBSo, tell me more about your dad.It’ll help with my present.

Din spots Cobb and waves, pointing him out. Cobb doesn’t recognise the man with Din.COBB(in low voice)Oh God, does he have a boyfriend?ISSA-ORWhy did you just assume that?COBBBecause I like him?Din and his friend approach the table. Cobb stands up to greet him.COBBHey, what are you doing here? (RE: Obi-Wan)Who’s this?OBI-WAN(quickly)Not his boyfriend.Issa-Or grins at Cobb, whose face flushes slightly.COBBWell, I ain’t ask that.OBI-WAN(apologetically)Sorry.

Obi-Wan’s eyes widen when he sees the child.OBI-WANWho’s this?COBBDin’s nephew.OBI-WANDid you kidnap him?COBBWhat? No. Why was that your firstthought?OBI-WANI’m not sure what I was supposedto think after being presentedwith a child that is mostdefinitely not yours.GROGU(quietly)Hi.OBI-WAN(to Grogu)Hello there.(to Cobb)What is he doing here?

We’ll see you again in abit and you’ll surprise yourdaddy.Grogu nods and follows Obi-Wan out of the Ghost Cafe. Cobb watches them leave, glancing down at the table in thought. He takes a quick look at Din at the counter before he stands and leaves as well.A few minutes later, Din and Issa-Or return with two coffees for Din and Obi-Wan. Din looks around, confused at the absence of the two men.DINWhere’d they go?ISSA-ORBeats me. It’s okay, we’ll havetheir coffee instead. Come on, Istill wanna talk about the bike.
INT. MANDALORE BAR - CONTINUOUS
Obi-Wan enters with Grogu, taking him straight to Satine.OBI-WANMy dear, this is Din’s nephew.

Once he’s out of earshot, Issa-Or texts Cobb: “Where did you go? Where’s Grogu?”She doesn’t get a response. Issa-Or curses under her breath and follows Din out.ISSA-ORWait, hold up! I’ll walk with you.
INT. MANDALORE BAR - CONTINUOUS
Everyone is ducking in booths and behind tables and the bar with the lights down. Grogu is not there.The doors open and Din and Issa-Or walk in. Din is confused at the lights being off.DIN(to Issa-Or)Sorry. It’s usually on by now, I’mnot sure what...Everyone jumps out as the lights flick on, cheering their birthday greetings. Din jolts back, surprised, but then a smile grows on his face when he realises it’s a birthday party.FENNECPeli couldn’t make it but shesends her love.DINIt’s fine. Thank you for this.Koska and Bo-Katan walk over, a bottle of Din’s favourite champagne in Koska’s hand.BO-KATANWell, let’s get the party started,then.As Bo-Katan and Koska get the bottle opened, Din turns to Fennec and Boba.DINWhere’s Cobb?FENNECI don’t know.

EXT. MANDALORE BAR - CONTINUOUS

I told Fennec I’dsteal you away for a bit. The resthave drinks and each other toentertain themselves anyway.Din laughs lightly.DINThat’s true.COBBCome on, birthday boy. Surprisesawait.
EXT. LOFT 3-5 - LATER
They stop outside the loft door and Cobb rests his hand on the doorknob.COBBClose your eyes.DINWhat have you done?COBBJust do it.(beat)Please?Din groans playfully and closes his eyes. He smiles faintly when he feels Cobb’s spare hand slip into his to guide him in.
INT. LOFT 3-5 - LATER
They walk into the loft, Din’s eyes still closed. He hears Cobb close the door behind him, then his footsteps indicate that Cobb has walked on ahead.COBBNow you can open ‘em.Din opens his eyes and his mouth falls open as he marvels at the loft. Darkened by the lights being off and the darkness of nighttime, the loft’s ceiling is lit by many glow-in-the-dark stars. At the table is a wrapped present.DINHow long did this take you?COBBToo long for my taste. I wish Ifinished in time to welcome you tothe party downstairs, but I wantedto do this for you.Din walks deeper into the loft, looking up at the stars.DINWhat made you do this?COBBFennec told me you’ve had a lot ofawful birthdays. I decided toinvite the one person in the worldyou love more than anything.Right then, Grogu jumps on from behind the couch. He runs over to Din who picks him up, his face drawn in pleasant surprise.GROGUHappy birthday!Din laughs—Cobb smiles at the sound.DINHey, kid!COBBI thought you’d wanna see him.Din’s gaze turns to Cobb, grateful.DINThank you so much.Cobb smiles.COBBNo problem. Kuiil made it happen.Also, Obi-Wan left because Groguwas with me in the cafe, and Iasked him for his help to getGrogu out without you seeing him.He and his fiancée watched the kidfor me until I picked him up fromthem before you arrived.Din nods like the pieces of the story are fitting together.COBBFennec helped Boba and me get ourpresents, so I brought mine uphere to wrap.He points to the poorly wrapped present sheepishly.COBBAs you can see, ain’t my strongestskill.DIN(sincerely)It’s great. Don’t worry about it.COBBI was takin’ Grogu back here afterIssa and I picked him up, and hetold me you like space a lot.GROGUYou're a spaceman!DINI don’t know if I know enoughabout it to call myself a""spaceman"", but... I guess I’vethought about it. What if, youknow?COBBYeah, I do. Well, I figured if Ican’t bring you to the stars, I’llbring the stars to you.(beat)Happy birthday, Din.Din grins at Cobb, who returns it just as happily. Grogu glances between the two men curiously.GROGUUncle Cobb is the bestest,smartest, handsomest gentleman!Din’s eyebrows raise slightly.DINI wonder who told you to say allthat.COBB(pretentiously)Yeah, I wonder who. I reallywonder who.Din chuckles quietly and carries Grogu over to the table where the wrapped present was.COBBYou can open it now if you like.Din carefully passes Grogu over to Cobb before he unwraps the present.Cobb’s present is a weathered red leather jacket. Din stares at it, stunned. Absently, he holds it to his chest and draws in a deep breath—faintly but still present, Din can smell his father’s scent on it.COBBWhen we went on our... when Ibought you a drink, you told meabout how your dad gave you one ofhis jackets as a kid but youcouldn’t find it when you movedaway. While I was figuring outpicking up Grogu, I asked Kuiilfor his help to find it. Hescrounged around, somehow found itin the corner of an old vintageshop? But he brought it along withGrogu. It should fit you by now.Din resists the urge to cry.DINCobb, I... thank you. Thank you.This is really thoughtful.COBB(jokingly)Well, I’m a tall man withfeelings.Din and Cobb both chuckle quietly.DINA tall man with feelings...Din steps closer. Cobb watches the movement.DINSeriously, thank you so much forall this. I think this might be myfavourite birthday.Cobb moves nearer, smiling softly.COBBYou’ve been nothin’ but welcomingsince I moved in, I figure I oweyou one good birthday in yourlife.Din’s eyes drop to Cobb’s lips for a second. They stare at one another, silent with tension. Grogu watches them, silent as well, as he waits for either of them to do something.DINPeli’s right, you know.COBBYeah?DINThis could backfire.A beat.COBBSure could.Cobb dares himself to inch closer. Din licks his lips, looking at Cobb’s mouth once again.They are interrupted by Satine and Obi-Wan who knock and enter. Cobb quickly steps out of Din’s personal space.OBI-WANSorry if we interrupted anything.Fennec sent us to come to get you.SATINEThey brought the cake!DINThank you. I’ll be right there.(to Grogu)Come on, kid. Let’s go.Cobb passes Grogu over to Din. Din gives him an apologetic look and then walks past Obi-Wan and Satine to go downstairs to the bar.Obi-Wan and Satine look up and see the stars.SATINESo this is what you brought himupstairs for.Cobb exhales slowly through his nose, a bit disappointed.COBBYep...OBI-WANThat’s very romantic.SATINEHow did it go?COBBHe said it was a bad idea.(beat, then quickly:)Which it is. I ain’t arguing that.But why can’t we just make baddecisions sometimes for the sakeof it? Why do all ideas have to begood? And why does everything needto be perfect? The right place,the right time, the rightsituation. The correct job, theperfect house. Sometimes, I don’twant to think about what happensif it doesn’t work.Obi-Wan and Satine exchange a meaningful glance, and then Satine walks over to put a comforting hand on Cobb’s shoulder.SATINEThe romantic in me says that itmay not be about checking off allthe boxes for the perfect lovestory. Perhaps the love story’s inthe long run.COBBIt’s not a love story. I don’tlove him.OBI-WANMaybe not now.He glances up at the stars overhead.OBI-WANBut I see it in the stars. Thenephew. The jacket. You like him,at least. Right?Cobb hums like he’s a bit reluctant to admit it, but is still agreeing.SATINEIf you like him, and he likes you,it’ll work itself out in time.COBBI guess you’re right.SATINENow let’s go have some cake!
INT. COBB’S ROOM - NIGHT
Cobb is lying in bed, trying to sleep. A soft knock raps on the door before it opens quietly.DIN(whispering)Cobb? Are you awake?Cobb pretends to be asleep.DINIf you are but you’re too tired toget up and talk, I’ll just say mypiece and go.(beat)Thank you for today. My birthdayhas been terrible since my parentsdied. None of it felt right; thecompany; the gifts; the parties.It never felt right because theyweren’t there.A beat. Cobb is listening intently.DINAll day, I’ve been avoiding it. Iwas glad nobody was wishing me ahappy birthday because it wasn’thappy for me at all. But you madetoday feel okay. You made it areally good day. I’m not so afraidof getting older. So thank you.(beat)I know you’re awake but you don’thave to say anything. I just wantyou to know how grateful I am thatyou’re my friend, and I’d reallyhate to ruin that.A longer pause than before.DINI know we’ve been friends for justunder two months, but I thinkyou’re one of the most importantpeople in my life. Maybe that’s abit strong, but it’s true. And Ihope you know I’ll always love youthe way you’ve made me feel lovedtoday. You’re family now.(beat)Goodnight, Cobb.COBB(quietly)Goodnight, Din.Din gently closes the door. Cobb draws in a slow breath before letting out a quiet sigh. His chest aches with the long run.




Notes:

Trying to incorporate more of a sitcom feel to this than it originally had by having the characters split into different plotlines that conjoin instead of everyone following the same one. This and the previous chapter fall into the new format. The first two are in the ""everyone has the same plot"" format. Hopefully, it doesn't feel too draggy or anything. I thought the first chapters felt too short because they were all following only one plot line."

What happens to him next?",2023-03-08,"Work Text:
Coldness.  Exhaustion.  Pain.  Relief.These were the last things Mayday felt before he drifted off, before the nightmare ended, a nightmare that constantly flickered and buzzed like the malfunctioning overhead lights at the outpost.  Before he felt something else.Darkness.  Comfort.  Peace.  Rest.But it did not last. A blaster shot woke him from his all too brief restful reprieve, followed by a thump to the ground. His eyelids fluttered open gingerly, stinging from the chilled wind that whooshed over his exposed cheeks and weary body to see the clone commando he had just met the previous rotation lying on the ground next to him.Crosshair... 
Engulfed by ice and snow, Mayday had considered himself lucky.  Maybe it would make it harder for the ice vultures to get him. His squad was gone.  And now it was his time to join them.  He'd be doing the Empire a favor.  And probably himself. 

The weight of the snow soon evaporated off of Mayday's chest as it was scooped from above by desperate hands, hands that now grasped at Mayday's icy armor, pulling him from the cocoon of white crystals.  

""Mayday?  Mayday, wake up!"" Crosshair had implored, his voice insistent, yet surprisingly soft, doing its best to coax Mayday from his delerium.  

Mayday wanted so much to placate him, but found he could not move, and maybe did not want to.  The avalanche had knocked him out and accompanied by the extensive freezing temperature, caused him great injury.

""Come on.  We have to move.""  Crosshair attempted to get him standing once again, using all of his strength to induce Mayday to listen and follow his lead.

""Go,"" Mayday had replied.  He was too injured.   ""I won't make it,""  he stammered, trying to make it easy for Crosshair to walk away, to save himself, to not be stuck with his 'dead weight.'  To his surprise, Mayday felt his helmet being placed back on his head.  And his body finally lifted out and freed of the crunchy snow that encased it.  

Crosshair. Crosshair carried his dead weight despite his previous belligerence not to. Crosshair who had come off as stand-offish, now protected him, kept him warm, through the avalanche of ice, the snow, the blistering, frigid gale that threatened to swallow them alive.

Mayday commanded Crosshair to leave him, but the sniper refused to follow the order. He made up his own mind. To save Mayday. To save himself.
 And now the lanky clone was lying next to him. Back at the outpost.  Did Crosshair get shot?  Mayday anxiously tried to speak, but found he could not get his vocal chords to work. A rumbling groan caught in his throat instead.A screech sounded overhead. Ice vulture. Waiting for something to die so it could enjoy a warm meal. More than the clones were ever afforded.  Mayday had to bury Crosshair.  It was the least he could do for his sacrifice.  He could not let the vultures pick at him.  He did not deserve that fate.  None of them did.  But he could not budge his sore, frozen muscles.  And then Mayday heard footsteps, echoing in his ear that was seemingly stuck to the hard, frozen ground.  He tried to fight it, but he nodded off once again, finding himself lazily drifting between worlds of conscious and unconscious dream and reality.Hands touching him. Weightlessness of his body as he was lifted. Words.“He's not worth saving.”As if Mayday hadn't heard that before. So many of his brothers. Dead. For what? Some crates of plastoid. Why keep those supplies on this desolate, frigid planet anyway? If they were so important, why did the Empire ignore his constant requests for more men and supplies that would help them in that endeavor?But Crosshair thought Mayday was worth saving.  At what cost?  Was Crosshair dead?  Who shot him?  Why?  Was it that distastefully arrogant lieutenant?  Mayday felt guilty that the sniper would have sacrificed himself to save him and he could not even repay the favor.More words.“He may prove as useful as CT-9904. Send them both.”9904...  Crosshair... Useful?  He was alive?  Mayday could not open his eyes anymore to see, as if he were conscious, but not awake.  He called out to the void of his churning mind and returning nightmares. Crosshair... Hexx...  Veetch... Were they all gone? Was he gone?He had been gone.  Buried.  It was perfect.  Fitting.  He was expendable and out of date.  Why did Crosshair unbury him?  More words.""What about the lieutenant?""""Process him.  His body can be sent to the same destination as the cargo and dealt with there.""HIs body?  The lieutenant's body?  Nolan was dead?  Whoa whoa whoa.  Wait... Did...  Did Crosshair shoot the lieutenant?  Heh.  And now the Imperial officer was being shipped out like the cargo they were supposed to protect.  Cargo that was not as important as it was made out to be after all.  No different than the fate of a clone to the Empire.  The sweet irony made Mayday's soul smile until that thought was interrupted.Injection of a stim. Warmth. The mechanical hum of hyperspace and subtle reverberations that coaxed his body through the stars. Was he experiencing the last jump?Was this death? Why could he still think? Why could he still see and hear and feel?And breathe.Mayday felt his body being moved once again. And the air that entered his lungs was no longer frigid, or stale and dry recycled air. It was warm, and moist, humid, fresh and earthy.He remembered a brief visit to Naboo when he was a shiny. There was a humbling comfort to the scent in the air as they trekked through a forest, leaves of every shade of green. He picked a leaf from a tree and ran his fingers over it, thick and shaped like a tear drop, he held it to his nose and inhaled its scent.  There were no trees on Kamino.  The only vegetation they ever saw as cadets was the green muck on their mess hall trays.  He didn't know why, but he stowed the leaf in a belt pouch.Every so often at the outpost, he would take it out of his pouch and carefully run his fingers over it, cycles later now hardened, losing its luster, like him. But a fragile reminder of a world he wished to live in someday. After the war.  If he survived.He didn't know if he was going to live in that world.  He did not know what world he lived in now.  He did not know if he even still lived.More words.""Clean up this clone and send him to a recovery room.  I believe Doctor Hemlock will be pleased to have two new guests.""  Guests?  That did not sound good.  Mayday was all too aware of the coy double speak of Imperials.  Mayday tried to open his eyes and this time he could finally see.  Blurry at first, but as his pupils adjusted to his surroundings, he saw another hover gurney floating away with Crosshair on it.  They were being loaded off of a ship into an outdoor hangar of some sort, trees in the distance.  That explained why he could smell a humid, fresh earthy scent.Mayday still had no idea where he was or why.  But at least he wasn't on that blasted, freezing outpost anymore.And at least he wasn't alone.  Crosshair was here with him."

Fives knew that Rex took their last campaign very hard. The arc trooper couldn’t blame him however, it was a very difficult campaign with the planet being awful, General Skywalker being gone and Krell.That campaign felt like it was never going end. Luckily it did because he could not survive another day there without attacking somebody.Fives knew he didn’t make that campaign any easier for Rex with all the fighting back he did with Krell but how could he not even before they knew what Krell was planning, he was just sending soldiers to their deaths and Fives could not allow that.That has always been Fives’ problem, he never really listened to his commanding officers even on Kamino when he was just a cadet he never really listen to what he was told which got him and his batch in a lot of trouble. It wasn’t like he was the only one though almost everyone in his batch didn’t listen the only one who did was-EchoBut his batch was long gone now and it hurt to remember them.Fives looked down at his helmet, which he was cleaning in his barrack, he wondered what his batch would have done in this kind of situation. It is almost impossible to tell but Fives would bet that they wouldn’t have listened to Krell like he didn’t.When Fives finished he decided to just walk around to clear his head.As he walked down the hallway he noticed that Jesse, Tup and Kix were all hiding behind a wall listening in on Rex and Commander Tano’s private conversations.He snuck up behind them to scare them when he heard the end of the conversation.”That should never had happed” Commander Tano argued to Rex.”I know but it did, all we can hope far is that the boys can move past it” Rex sighed. Fives saw Kix and Jesse give each other a look before turning back to the conversation.”And what about you?” The commander asked with concern heavy in her voice. Fives’s listened closely, he knew that Rex wasn’t doing well no matter what he said but he wanted to know if he will tell the commander the truth.”I’m fine” Rex said unconvincingly before he sighed “I’m just going to find Cody and talk to him, he lost a lot of men to this too” with that Rex walked away. Kix was shaking his head at what the captain just said.”Rex if you need anything you can always ask me and Master Skywalker we will both be happy to help” the togruta responds.Fives saw Rex turn and give a little nod before he head off to find Commander Cody.Commander Tano turned into another hallway and left leaving the four clones alone in the hallway.”There is one thing I know” Fives said making the other three jump, having not noticed that he snuck up behind them “Rex is not doing fine at all”.Kix nodded “No he isn’t and if he keeps going on like this then he will just crash when he can no longer hold it in”.”I feel bad” Tup muttered looking at where the commander and captain just left.”Rex was having such a hard time on that mission, I wish we could help him” Jesse muttered.”I’m not surprised he was” Fives shrugged “This situation was entirely new to him”.”A General that betrays there troopers?” Jesse sarcastically asked “Because this is new to all of us Fives”.”Firstly not what I was talking about, also you know about Slick and I know it isn’t the same but both were commanding officers so it is not entirely new for Rex” Five rolled his eyes “And secondly you don’t have to be sarcastic”.Jesse just rolled his eyes in response but Fives can see the smirk growing on his face.”No, what is entirely new to him is the fact that he didn’t get to make any decisions in this battle” Fives said.Tup looked confused which didn’t surprise Fives he was newer to the 501st after all. Kix and Jesse on the other looked like they understood exact what Fives was talking about.”Your right” Kix agreed “He always had some kind of choice in the battles that we are a part of”.”What do you mean?” Tup asked confused “I mean, I know that he can make suggestions but isn’t it really only commanders and generals that really make plans and decisions about what we are going to do on the battlefield?”.”Well the only reason that Rex is a captain and not a commander is because of Commander Tano and he would not change that for anything” Jesse smiled “He loves the general’s padawan and he loves working with her”.Fives and Kix nodded in agreement. Rex would gladly stay a captain for Commander Tano and everyone knew that.Kix decided to explain “At this point he is only a captain by title he is more like a commander, he is allowed to question the generals decision, he can make his own suggestions and he is allowed to make some of his own strategies for the general to use”.Tup nodded understanding what the three older clones were telling him.”And with all that freedom General Skywalker gave him it’s easy to forget that he is still only able to work and do what the general allows him to do”.Tup understood immediately “Krell not giving Rex that freedom to do what he would think is necessary and right in would be painful to him” Tup summed up.The other three nodded at that.”Rex can normally do anything under General Skywalker, kriff General Skywalker trust Rex enough that Rex could just come up and execute ideas or plans without having to run them by the general first” Fives sighed “And with Krell not giving any leeway even punishing his troopers, well…”Fives didn’t need to say it, they all watched Rex basically fall apart, Krell made him lead his men into attacking other clones, the 212th the brother legion of the 501st, he made Rex stand by as Fives and Jesse were about to be killed by other clones, their own vod, on Krell’s orders. Rex couldn’t do anything and it took a huge toll on the clone captain.Rex had no choices until he decided that they were going to go after Krell, which the four of them were happy about.“Like I said I wish we can help him” Jesse sighed.”He has to let us help, he will never tell any of us how he is feeling” Fives shook his head.”Well if he actually does go to Cody then Cody can make him talk, and can get Rex to tell him everything I mean he is Rex’s ori'vod“ Kix said.”That is all we can hope for” Fives stated looking resigned. A long silence followed as the group collects their thoughts.”He probably would not appreciate that we are talking about him” Jesse pointed out “He should probably stop before someone tells him and we get in trouble”.”Yeah” Kix agreed as Tup nodded. They all were punished by Rex and least once, some more than others *cough* Fives *cough* and they all knew that it was never any fun.”Why don’t we get something to eat” Fives suggested and the other three nodded. The four left to eat but they all still had Rex on their minds.It wasn’t going to be easy for the clone captain but he always had Commander Tano, General Skywalker, Cody, General Kenobi and his vod in the 212th and the Vod in the 501st to help him.Fives knew that he was always going to help Rex even if Rex didn’t want his help. Fives would always be there for ori'vod and he knew the other three will be there as well."
45593374,"No Archive Warnings Apply, Nonfiction, Meta, Time - Freeform, Timelines",On time and official timelines (or lack thereof) in Star Wars.,2023-03-08,"Work Text:
If time exists so that everything doesn't happen at once, timelines exist to help us keep track of it all. This is more complicated than you might think, especially when it comes to Star Wars.It started off simply enough. The old Extended Universe used a dating system based off the events of A New Hope, marking the years before and after the Battle of Yavin (BBY and ABY, respectively). This was never meant to be an in-universe calendar, merely a convenient way of organizing and keeping track of the rapidly ballooning amount of tie-in materials.Early tie-in novels published by Bantam Spectra did not come with a timeline, though excerpts and summaries from other books were often attached at the end of paperback releases with notes to put them in context. By the Del Rey era, each new Star Wars novel included a chart organizing all of the previous installments in chronological order and fixed dates; the Clone Wars tie-ins had their own specific timeline that solely covered material set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. With a bit of mental math, fans could easily determine how much time had passed between installments, how old various characters and institutions were, and other useful information.In 2014, Disney took over Lucasfilm and swept the slate clean, relegating the old Expanded Universe to a separate parallel universe known as Legends. In addition to giving the shiny new Extended Universe a fresh start, the writers at Disney completely revamped both the timeline itself and their approach to it in unexpected ways.Specifically, they abandoned the use of any kind of numerical dating system in the official timelines. While the charts in the tie-in novels are still arranged chronologically in relationship to each other and the movies, there is now no way to determine how much time (if any) has passed between installments, or when a given era (High Republic, prequels, etc) begins or ends, except directly from the source material. The lack of fixed dates has made it much more challenging for fans and fan writers to determine relatively simple questions about when certain events took place, especially as the Star Wars canon spans a wide variety of media, from movies to books to comics, which can be difficult to keep track of.It doesn't help that canon was initially vague over the exact timing of events between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, some but not all of which were later clarified with the publication of supplementary material or through official social media or convention panels. A scroll through the citations for various dates on Wookiepeedia, the official Star Wars fan wiki, reveals a wide variety of sources, ranging from complicated fan calculations to official press releases. For example, here is how Wookiepeedia determines that Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy was founded in 9 ABY:
The Book of Boba Fett takes place after the events of ""Chapter 16: The Rescue,"" which Star Wars Insider 202 places nine years after Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, which corresponds to 9 ABY according to Star Wars: Galactic Atlas. Additionally, Star Wars Insider 211 states that Boba Fett's hiring of Krrsantan, an event that appears in ""Chapter 4: The Gathering Storm,"" took place nine years after A New Hope. Therefore, the events of The Book of Boba Fett up to Chapter 4 must take place in 9 ABY. As the events of The Book of Boba Fett take place over a short time, Chapters 5–7 take place in approximately the same year.
In a similar vein, the entry for the dates of Galaxy's Edge says:
Galaxy's Edge: Black Spire begins concurrent with the events of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, then jumps four months ahead to the Resistance establishing its presence on Batuu, and concludes with an epilogue set several weeks later, when the First Order occupies the planet and the Battle of Batuu begins. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is also set during the occupation of Batuu and depicts the Battle of Batuu via the attraction Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance. The Star Wars Book dates the Battle of Batuu to 34 years after the events of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, which corresponds to 34 ABY according to Star Wars: Galactic Atlas. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary also places the Battle of Batuu six months after The Force Awakens, which Galactic Atlas dates to 34 ABY. Therefore everything within Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and any related tie-in media depicting the Battle of Batuu, or set between The Force Awakens and the battle, must also occur in 34 ABY.
You'd think it would be easier for everyone if Disney had just come out and said this directly, but apparently not. It appears that specific concrete dates are for the chosen few in the official story group to know; everyone else has to muddle along as best they can--hardly an attitude conducive to fandom! The net effect is an incredible vagueness and plasticity to the franchise--perhaps more freeing for the creators, but disorienting to the audience (or at least, to me). The old system might have been arbitrary, but it was simple and convenient; the problem is not so much that Disney rejected it, but that they did not replace it with anything.Fortunately, as mentioned above, while Disney is reluctant to use any kind of numerical dating system, the old system has not been completely abandoned by the fandom. Wookiepeedia still uses BBY and ABY in their own timelines for the Disney canon. The Wookiepeedia entries for most new tie-in novels also include a date using the old system, though this number is usually not present anywhere in the novels themselves and must be inferred through context. There are also many other fan-constructed timelines of varying quality and detail on the Internet which also use the old dating system.Sensing a need to fill the vacuum it created, Disney announced an official Star Wars: Timelines reference book to address the perennial question of ""what happened when?"" once and for all. Originally scheduled for a November 2022 release, as of this writing, it was delayed until April 2023, so I cannot comment on the final product. However, the sample pages available on Amazon do contain numerical dates using the old BBY and ABY system carried over from Legends, the first time I have ever seen those terms in print in the new canon, albeit in relatively small type at the top of each page that de-emphasizes their importance compared to the graphics and main text. Still, this is a promising development, one that I hope will be more prominent in the new canon going forward--even if it also feels I'm watching Disney re-invent the wheel in real time."

Chapter Text
This is a tale of two.One of the light,And one of the dark.Our story begins however as most do, with the introduction of our first lead.Light.Pale blue, uncertain eyes surveyed the lush green surrounds of the planet Felcuia. It had been some time since Keera Suden had returned to her home planet and the young Twi’lek hadn't left on… particularly good terms.“ Are you getting off or what?” A gruff voice shook her out of the memories and the bustling sounds of civilisation and life reached her ears once more, glancing over her shoulder at the human pilot of the shuttle she had arrived on and blinking a few times before she responded.“ Oh, Right! Sorry…”  Taking a deep breath to center herself and stop her thoughts from wandering once more she stepped off the shuttle and into the capital city of Kway Teow. Pulling the hood of her brown cloak over her head and being sure to keep her twin sabers hidden underneath it, Keera began to make her way to the cantina she was supposed to meet her contact at.Dos Frey Cantina was quiet for the late afternoon, dimly lit with smooth music from the band playing in the corner and as the green skinned Twi’Lek stepped into the space none of the few patrons paid her any mind, much to her relief. Making her way to a booth in a far, shadowed corner and politely declining service before making herself as non descript as possible and waiting, anxiously and impatiently waiting but waiting nonetheless.Meanwhile, in the depths of the wilds and slowly making their way towards the city we meet our second lead…Dark“Sir. This is not enroute toward the fleet’s rendezvous point. Would you like me to recalculate our course?”Lucell blew a strand of blonde out of his eyes and smacked another branch out of his way as he trudged forward through the obnoxious greenery. He knew he should’ve left the droid on board the ship. But if they were going to do this right, then he would need more supplies than what Darth Drevog had allotted him. And a communicator or two that wasn’t already tracked by the empire wouldn’t be a bad idea either. So if he could get QR-7 to do the shopping–a maintenance droid wouldn’t look too suspicious in a big city after all–then they could be off this sticky planet much faster.QR’s voice suddenly switched to the recorded deep guttural of the Darth. “Time is of the essence, my apprentice and it is imperative that I have this holocron. You see–”“And he’ll have it.” Lucell swung his fist back into the maintenance droid before it got them both killed by any suspicious outpost guards. “But it won’t be by dragging his whole blasted fleet around the galaxy.” They might as well send a signal flare to the darth’s rivals while they were at it. Or to anyone else who was after the holocron.Besides, it was a disgusting show of his master’s ego. An ego so inflated it was beginning to blind the old man these days. Really, Lucell was doing him a favor. Even if that last-minute landing in the middle of the jungle might cost him some repair fees down the line.“What is your plan, sir? So that I may update my files and be of more use to you.”Well, if it got him to shut up. “I’m meeting a contact.”“Where is your contact? I will assist with navigation.”“I didn’t say she was *my* contact,” Lucell smirked. “Don’t concern yourself. Just fill the supply list I gave you.”“Yes, sir.”They finally reached part of the city where Lucell could see the domed top of the Dos Frey Cantina. QR shuffled off in another direction while Lucell quietly masked his force abilities. He didn’t bother with much else as he already knew he didn’t exactly look the part of the bloodthirsty sith. Even with his gloomy wear, a fresh face, a pair navy eyes, and an easy saunter wasn’t enough to invite much suspicion. But he couldn’t say the same for the stern looking man hurrying on ahead of him.The one that kept pulling his robe around him and checking some sort of navigation device in his hands. Clearly an eager, though inexperienced, Jedi a bit out of his element. And possibly late for something. If Lucell were to guess, he’d say he just found the real contact. He casually followed, keeping enough distance to not alarm the man any further. It was a long, rather comical walk through the city but eventually, he was led to the cantina.He checked the device once more–just to be sure–-and Lucell chose that moment to walk up behind him and bump hard into his shoulder, causing the startled jedi to drop his precious piece of tech. Lucell caught it then did the poor man a solid, erasing the quest from his memory. For all the jedi knew, it was now complete. He could go back to his quarters and rest.His master would've hated such a “weak” maneuver. But then his master wasn’t the one on the job, was he? He was too busy being holed up in his command center, paranoid of the whole slew of enemies his “strong” maneuvers had won him.The tiny screen on the device read the cantina’s address as well as some sort of encoded message from a Keera Suden. Nodding, Lucell pocketed the device and stepped across the lot and into the Dos Frey.It didn’t take him long to spot the Twi’lek. One, because she was sitting by herself and two, because she looked somewhat impatient. With a smile, he walked over to her booth and slid into the seat across from her.“Lucell Edgeday,” he said, tossing the device onto the table. “I have a ship with the empire’s newest tech, a year’s worth of victuals, and certain itch for vengeance to scratch.” His smile widened and he looked directly at her. “I want in.”Light and DarkBy all things she really did not want to be back here. It’s not Keera didn’t /like/ her home planet, it was a beautiful place full of lively green and blues that sometimes would even glow under the right light of Felix, the planets moon. But it brought back memories she would rather forget about, and increased the possibility of running into people she really didn’t care too.Giving a heavy sigh her gaze continued to flick around the cantina, humming quietly along to the music being played as she recognised the song in a vain attempt to calm her already anxious nerves. Her attire did look a little obviously Jedi in nature, albeit paler in its colour tones, indicative of one who spent more time in the archives of the order than in the field, possibly why she seemed so impatient.Keeras mission was clear, meet the contact, find the ruins, get the holocron. If possible find and retrieve the sun blade itself. “ /Only/ if it’s possible, understand green bean? If it’s too far, or you feel like you can’t handle it, come back with the holocron and we can go from there.“ her former masters words echoed in her mind, words that had been spoken to her as she boarded the shuttle heading to Felucia. Aldrin still cared for her greatly, and their relationship had been describe as that if a father and daughter a few times and as This was her first solo mission since ascending,  there was pressure to do well.Blue eyes snapped to the newcomer as he approached and took a seat, demeanour immediately shifting to a more alert one as she glanced down at the device briefly before tilting her head to the side a little, judging, appraising. “Are you now? I must admit your not who I was expecting” while very very slight there was a hint of an accent in her voice.She tried reaching out with the force to get a read for him, only to find nothing and frown a little, pulling back into herself slightly, distrusting, atleast for the moment.“And just who were you expecting?” Lucell smiled. “Because if it was a certain jedi maybe a year or two just out of his training then trust me. It’s a small loss.”He ordered the both of them drinks and rested back in his seat. Then, at her alarmed expression added. “Oh. Don’t worry, he’s fine. Of course, the council might be a bit confused when he shows up confidently empty-handed, but…” his voice faded off and he shrugged. “It might give us a good chance at a head start.”The drinks arrived and he took them, sliding one across to Keera. “Because I imagine we will have a fleet or two on our tail before long once they sort it out.” And once the Darth lost his patience. He couldn’t mention anything about being a sith right now though. Not unless they wanted to attract unwanted attention. But she'd figure it out soon enough.He took a long sip, winced slightly at the unfamiliar hint of junglesap flavor that must have been a Dos Frey special, and looked over at her. He already knew from the messages he’d intercepted only hours ago that she was smart enough for the task. And she looked capable enough. But those bright blue eyes studied him right back in a way that was a bit unnerving. If this whole deal worked out, he reminded himself that he’d have to be careful around this one. She probably didn’t miss much.He cleared his throat. “I understand our first destination is to some sort of ruins?”Keera took the drink but didn’t actually drink it, rather just tapping her fingers on the cup before she realised what she was doing and pulled her hand away from it, placing it underneath the table to hide her anxious fiddling.  She did indeed look a little alarmed at the mention of the Jedi she was /supposed/ to meet here, though it showed only momentarily and in the form of an expression that flashed across her features.  if anything the mention of it only caused more distrust towards him despite the reassurances.There was something dangerous about him that she couldn’t quiet place, something off and the fact that she couldn’t glean anything through the force didn’t help his case. But she supposed the galaxy was full of dangerous feeling people and she had been wrong before, she would have to be careful with this one.Giving a quiet hum of curiosity, still trying to figure out if he was being genuine or not and was having a hard time doing it the girl moved her gaze away from him and too the surrounding cantina once more, willing to give him benefit of the doubt for the time being.“ Ruins... yes... “ she seemed distracted “ that Jedi was supposed to tell me where they were, so unless you know something I don’t, you’ve put me at a standstill” she replied after a moment of listening to him talk, still not looking at him and rather talking over her shoulder slightly.“ You mentioned vengeance, how exactly does one looking for vengeance come across word of a mission such as this? “ she questioned, poking, testing.The offered drink sat ignored.Idiot, how could he have missed the fact that she didn’t yet have the location for the ruins? He should’ve gotten that information from the Jedi and /then/ wiped his memory. It was an unbelievably rookie mistake and he silently cursed himself for it.Because not even his master had the location. That’s what the whole fleet parade had been for. To search. He supposed he'd just have to sort that part out when he got back to his ship. For now, it still wouldn’t be a bad idea to win over an ally. It would be nice to have someone along who could hold a blaster–and a conversation–better than the droid. Plus, she likely knew more about the relic than he did.“Simple,” he said in answer to her question. “As I hope you’re aware, you’re not the only ones after the holocron. I’ve been given the same mission as you, only with some less-than-helpful instructions. So I began doing some homework–latest tech in the empire, remember. It took me some time, but I gleaned a few dead-end leads from some bounty hunters. And then ultimately it was your lot that sounded like they knew what they were doing. I’ll never say it on record, but you typically are the first ones to the punch.”He took another long sip then continued. “The vengeance part is a bit personal, but let’s just say the whole scenario sets me up nicely to–”“Sir! Sir!”Lucell inwardly groaned as the droid’s buzzing grew closer, trailing grumbles, grunts, and explicatives from those whose chairs he bumped or toes he mindlessly rolled over.“Sir, I have been directed to contact you immediately.”Lucell shut his eyes, fighting back a surge of pure annoyance as the maintenance droid rolled up to their table. Had the bucket of bolts even picked up the supplies? Before he could ask, QR-7 was displaying another small hologram of Darth Drevog right onto the table in front of them. His Zabrak spikes were somewhat hidden by the mess of cyborg mechanisms attached to his head, but his anger was more than evident.“Not here, you idiot,” Lucell hissed, giving the droid a hard kick. It wobbled, but the message continued to come through.“--apprentice! This is no time for your antics. If you do not join the fleet in the next hour, the fleet will find you instead. And I assure you, you will not like the outcome.”Lucell could’ve murdered the droid on the spot. And would have, if he was in any mood to deal with the ship’s plumbing.“Oh, don’t get your horns in a twist, I’m just picking up supplies.”“You have supplies.”“Better supplies.”“Is…is that a Twi’lek? Edgeday, /where are you/?!”“Probably a bar fight, if you keep yelling.” The resounding voice of the Darth now had every eye in the cantina trained at their booth and he could sense a few rising from their seats.The city may have held some ties to the Empire, but that didn’t mean everyone inside the city was happy about it.“Get. Your ass. To. The station.”The image faded and Lucell couldn’t help laughing to himself a little. Then, catching Keera’s gaze, his expression sombered.“Like I said. Same assignment, stupid instructions.”Continuing not to look at him as the stranger continued to explain himself Keera was only half listening too his explanations, suddenly much more interested in the heavily armoured Rodian that had entered the cantina with a band of five or so others behind him., Who glanced around before taking a seat at the bar.Oh that was not good. She recognised the group as bounty hunters and had encountered them before on a previous mission and if her intuition was correct, which it usually was, they where here for the same reason she was. This was quickly becoming very potentially dangerous, first this unreadable stranger who had intercepted her contact and now that group. She needed to leave. Information could be found elsewhere and not in the presence of such company.Tuning back into what was being said she only really heard the end of it. Turning to look at him again “ well, as much as I appreciate the offer, and your skills are admirable, I’m going to have to decline, ‘my lot’ as you so aptly put it have this handled, so if you’ll excuse me...” she moved out of the booth and stood up, readjusting herself and was going to make her leave before a droid bumped into her, drawing a quiet ‘ow’ from her as she was pushed into the corner of a table. The sudden annoyance of the stranger drew her attention back to him just as the transmission began.if the address of ‘apprentice’ wasn’t enough the figure in the transmission only alarmed her further. A look of shock appeared on her face as she watched the encounter take place and as it finished she took a step back from the now identified Sith apprentice. Shit. Had she really been that stupid? Who else would be able to intercept such a message? And no random guy had access to new empire tech.All the eyes on them made her even further uncomfortable as she addressed Lucell once more, expression cold. “ same assignments indeed... “ whatever she was going to continue to say was interrupted by a shout and Keera ducked down just in time to miss a blaster bolt that had been fired at her head, seems like the droid had drawn the attention of the bounty hunters aswell.A second bolt follow the first, this time aimed at Lucell and more quickly followed aimed at the two, screams filled the previously quiet cantina as patrons rushed for the doors. Giving a loud curse Keera summoned her lightsabers too her hands and the yellow blades flared up, sending a few of the blaster bolts shooting back towards their owners.Lucell barely dodged the first blast aimed at him. He scowled at the steaming, singed leather by his head; stupid bounty hunters. He supposed it was only a matter of time before they crashed the party. The prize was too big. A few /had/ picked up on his probing, but he had warned them not to pursue. A warning they wouldn’t ignore the second time.He twirled his red sabers from his belt and leapt onto the table before they hummed to life. A few feet in front of him, Keera already had her own two sabers out and was blocking much of the onslaught in a whirlwind of yellow. It was an impressive sight, but he wasted little time in admiring it before front-flipping over her and slashing down on the nearest bounty hunter.The man didn’t even have time to scream before his severed body collapsed. And by then Lucell already held another hunter in a force grip. One of her comrades, hearing her choking, hurried forward and Lucell flung her hard into her friend, sending them both into the panicking crowd and bowling over a cluster of fleeing employees. Then, for good measure, he stepped behind a huge, upturned vat of ale and gave it a solid kick, sending it rolling toward the crowd before using the force to pressure its contents into an explosion.A sharp sting of pain stuck deep into his shoulder, stopping him short and causing him to stumble forward. A throwing knife. Gritting his teeth in pain, he whirled around and threw his saber toward his attacker. It spun, decapitating the offender before boomeranging back around and finding its way back around into Lucell’s grip. He clipped it back on his belt and reached back for the small handle of the blade. Sucking in a breath, he yanked it out and tossed it aside, navy eyes now burning a vivid yellow.But he knew this was far from the end of the fight. Outside, he could hear more bounty hunters approaching and–perhaps worse where he was concerned–city officials. And some of those city officials were better force wielders than either of them. It was only a matter of minutes before they were entirely in over their heads.Lucell dodged more blaster shots. This wasn’t going near as well as he’d hoped.“Forget the holocron for now!” he said, finding his way toward Keera. “As far as this planet cares, we’re already a team. Our best bet is the jungle if we don’t want to end up dead.” Of course, he was sure the Jedi would have her own plans of killing him once they were there–now that he’d absolutely ruined everything for her–but he’d have to cross that bridge when he got to it.Keera gave a startled noise as she was rushed by two of the hunters, both wielding vibroblades. Spinning around them so that she didn’t have her back to a wall she force pushed them violently into it, wincing a little at the sharp crack of their heads against the hard surface before they slumped to the ground. She really didn’t like hurting people and would only do so in self defence, which this definitely is, didn’t mean she found it any less unpleasant.Stepping back once more she watched as Lucell tore into the group paying no heed to the safety of the civilians in an admittedly impressive, if distastefully violent display of red and black. Sith, always so violent. Keera closed her eyes for a moment, taking a breath to steady herself before the Twi’leks figure appeared to blur and almost become fuzzy around the edges, making it harder to gain a lock on her before making her way towards a group of fleeing patrons, helping a few back too there feet and ushering them towards the door, covering their escape and taking out a few more bounty hunters with some deftly deflected blaster shots.Keera caught a glimpse of Lucell kicking the barrel over and conntected the dots just in time to throw up a force shield, protecting herself and the group currently behind her from most of the ensuring blast but still giving a pained yelp as the heat singed her skin. Dropping the shield she shot him a look of pure annoyance and irritation before, allowing herself a little spiteful moment and force shoving down towards his feet in an attempt to trip him.Ushering the group she was protecting out of the space she also managed to hear the sounds of commotion coming from outside and while she was frustrated out of her mind right now she wasn’t stupid, and taking on an entire city of enforcers and hunters was not going to end well. God dammit! Why now? Everything was fine....Keera switched her attention to Lucell as he approached her, and as much as she hated to admit it, the Sith was right. The two had been seen together now and as far as anyone was concerned they where both targets. Giving an annoyed noise from the back of her throat she nodded reluctantly “ yeah yeah fine, come on then.” She snipped, turning and ducking out of the cantina, not waiting to see if he would follow.Outside was chaos, anxious and panicked people dashed around while some people looked confused at the sudden shift in atmosphere. A group of well armoured officials  where trying to calm people down as another group of what could only be bounty hunters began to shove there way through the crowd towards Keera and if he had followed Lucell.Glancing sideways at him she deactivated both of her sabers, form still unstable under the affect of force blur, pulled up her hood again and ducked into a side alley, beginning to make her way to the outskirts of the capital.Lucell followed Keera out of the cantina, the high of a good fight causing him to forget about his bleeding shoulder. But he still looked back at the carnage left in their wake. At the individuals who had probably only come to blow off steam after a long day of work. At the remaining bounty hunters paying a much higher price than they’d ever bargained for. At the lives he’d ruined.It was a nasty habit of his, looking back. And the only real cure he’d ever found for it came in the form of a martini mix of numbing chemicals and stims he kept stashed away on his ship. A ship he may or may not make it back to by tonight, which wasn’t a pleasant thought.Thankfully, he was pulled from it by the hurried footfalls of another band of bounty hunters determined to not lose their prize. He noticed Keera glance his way then slip into an alleyway and, trusting that she was more familiar with the city, he sent one more force blast toward the hunters and then followed. He kept up with her zigzagging course through ramshackle buildings, rusted and mossy with the jungle humidity. And though he had told her to forget about the holocron, he had failed to forget about it himself. She had mentioned that others in her network knew the location, but if he took his ambitions too close to the Jedi council, it would be the perfect fodder for a battle that would really only be a waste of time, manpower, and resources.No, he’d already ditched his master’s fleet and blew up a cantina. That was more than enough attention drawing for one day. If the rest was going to work, it needed to be a quiet, one-on-one sort of agreement.And anyway, he didn’t a give bantha’s behind about the actual weapon the holocron led to. All he cared about was–“Woah, hey!” he gripped Keera’s arm and yanked her back as a troop of city patrolling droids began marching down the next turn of alleyways, startling beggars and street waifs back into their holes. He sensed her glare and let go before he earned a yellow saber to the stomach.“Listen,” he muttered, while they waited for the buzzing, clanking mess of metal and weapons to make its way past them. “I’m willing to do this your way. I don’t need the Sun Blade. I just need to make sure a few dangerous idiots and their two remaining brain cells don’t get their hands on it. But you’re the only one who knows how to find the location of the ruins. And I’m the only one who can keep said idiots off the scent. Do you think that there’s even a fraction of a chance we could work something out?”Not likely. Not after his reckless display in the cantina. But it was worth a shot.Keera did not spare a single glance back at him as they made their way through the back alleys and side streets of the capital. She had grown up here after all and as such knew the place like the back of her hand. Dropping the blur effect so that she could concentrate more on her surroundings instead of maintaining it she turned a corner, not keeping a straight path incase of pursuers. She too was dwelling on the chaos and damages at the cantina, albeit for different reasons.She was more worried about the lives she had endangered by being there. Yes it wasn't entirely her fault but maybe if she had chosen a more remote meetup point… Ah, there was the dreaded self doubt, another bad habit of hers she was working on slowly. Doubt was dangerous in certain situations and this was definitely one of them.The newly knighted jedi really couldn't afford to be doubting herself right now, this was too important, too much was depending on her obtaining this holocron and weapon. Why her again? Surely there was someone better suited for the task. Normally she had someone with her who would notice her spiraling and pull her out of it but not this time, this time she was on her own.Lost in her thoughts she didn't notice she was about to step directly into the path of a droid patrol until Lucell grabbed her and pulled her back into the shadowed alley. The look she sent him was one of pure annoyance and anger, that dangerous anger. Only for a moment though, then it was gone. Shaking her arm free despite him letting go she didn't say anything until she was sure the patrol was out of sight. Only then did she look back at him.“Everything was going just fine until you showed up” she muttered back, keeping one eye on their surroundings. “Why do you even care? If you don’t want the weapon, why intercept my contact? Why approach me at all?” she leant back against the wall and ducked her head as another patrol began to pass by, letting out a breath as they passed once more.She admittedly acknowledged that having him help keep the sith off her tail would be helpful, the idea was tempting, and it's not like she couldn't just leave him if he screwed her over again.Lucell sighed, somewhat impatient, even if he knew she had every reason to question further. “Well, for starters, if my master gets his hands on that thing, I’m going to be its first victim, I have no illusions there. But it’s worse than that. He and the rest of the Sith council have kept most of the news about it between themselves. And it’s made them delusional enough to think they are more powerful than even the emperor, and they intend to prove it. I don’t care what side you’re on; you don’t hand someone like that a sunblade.”Which is why he’d only technically promised a holocron.“But they don’t just want one blade. If they find the weapon, they think they’ve found a way to mass-produce something similar. And they plan to own the Emperor wholesale–as well as any one else who opposes them. Of course, they’ve already started turning on each other so they’ve pitted me against a few other suck-up apprentices to do their dirty work and see who can find it first.”He met her gaze to make sure she knew he wasn’t making this up. “Don’t get me wrong, I’ve–” he was going to say ‘killed’ but settled for, “done worse for weaker weapons. But if any of them gets their way, it won’t just be another round of empire versus rebels. It will be anarchy.”Keera listened intently to Lucells explanation, though she continued to not look at him for the majority of it, only looking at him at the conclusion, meeting his gaze with sharp blue eyes that seemed to pierce through any lie, any deception he might be attempting, only to see nothing of the sort. Damn, the bantha shit was being truthful.Giving a deep sigh she nodded begrudgingly. “ alright, fine... but if I catch wind of you doing /anything/ and I mean anything to purposely sabotage my mission or otherwise, I will leave you to die, understand?” She murmured sideways too him. Regardless of his reply or lack thereof she reached out with the force to sense any incoming patrols and upon finding none gestured for him to follow before heading off again.Admittedly she too had some doubts about her own orders council, doubts that her master shared with her.“Trust yourself, if you feel like someone has has bad intentions you are probably correct. You have some of the best intuition I’ve ever seen “ Aldrin had said to her one time after he had come back particularly irritated from a meeting with the Jedi council.“Even within our council there is lies, deceit, just be wary of everyone, even me.”Eventually they arrived at one of the side exits of the city that would lead them into the open wildlands of Felucia, only to find it guarded heavily by city officials, way more than she remembered there being in the past.Cursing quietly too herself she turned to face Lucell. “ that’s our way out, seems like the show at the cantina drew more attention than I thought…”It had been a bit jarring going from her not looking at him–a habit of hers he was becoming increasingly aware of–and then being soul-searched by those bright Twi’lek eyes. But for once, he really did have nothing to hide.He could tell she didn’t like that. But it was a place to start, anyhow. He nodded in agreement to her terms and then he too turned to their immediate task of escape.Under any other circumstances, he might have risked just plunging in and blasting them away before anyone could ask questions. But if he wanted the location to the ruins, he figured he’d better not push his luck any further with a peace-loving jedi knight.But even if the city had other exits, they’d likely be just as swarmed with patrol and surveillance. He turned his gaze away toward another alley where he heard a small group of patrolmen talking amongst themselves.“Give me a minute,” he sighed. Then hurried back the way they’d come and turned out of sight of Keera. There was an alarmed shout, a few blaster shots, and the sounds of a scuffle before he returned a few moments later, arms laden with robes, belts, boots, and helmets.“Here,” he handed a set to Keera. “It should be big enough you can just slip it over. And we’ll need to come from that direction so we don’t cause suspicion.” Then, with something of a scowl, added: “And no, I didn’t kill them.”“But if anyone does stop us and ask questions, we’ll report that we’ve been sent to patrol the outerwall. If they don’t believe us,” he shrugged. “We should be close enough by then to make a run for it.”Unless, of course, she had any better ideas. He was never much for disguises, as he knew he wasn’t much of an actor. There was little use for pretending in his line of work, but if push came to shove he supposed he could pull it off. Anything to get back into that foggy, sticky, god-forsaken jungle.The habit of avoiding looking at him was going to be a constant, she had decided that if she pretended he didn’t exist where possible the less she would have to put up with him. Very much a ‘ if I don’t see you you don’t exist’ type of attitude.  Very childish in its application all things considered.If there had been less people, she would’ve just used a mind trick to get past, but she could only do that to one person at a time. It was as she was thinking this that Lucell had his idea and she didn’t have a chance to react before he darted off. Standing their stunned for a moment before he returned. Genuinely having to think for a moment to let her thoughts catch up, I mean... I guess that worked? Blinking a few times and shaking her head a bit she took the disguise from him.“Your learning!” She taunted sarcastically, slipping on the disguse, admittedly struggling a little to get the helmet over her lekku, but she managed. Giving a quiet grumble as they where pressed uncomfortably to her head.“This was your idea, lead the way” she said with a could be mocking gesture in the direction he had disappeared to before. Following his lead she drew her awareness into herself, shielding her force signature incase one of the gate guards where force sensitive.As they approached the gate one of the guards called out an order to halt and she stopped, deciding to let Lucell do the talking in the hope he was better at lying than she was, because she was aweful at it.“Why have you two reversed course? I just told your squad to scope out the northern region.”Lucell waited for a second just to see, but the Twi’lek made no sign that she was going to step in. He scowled behind his helmet. She was enjoying this whole “This was your idea” thing, wasn’t she?“Change of orders,” he replied, his voice muffled by the helmet. “They need more eyes along the wall. The squad ahead of us believs the perpetrators are approaching this gate.” Then, unsure of protocol, added. “Sir.”The officer looked around him then back at Lucell. “What are they, blind? “We’ve already got a whole–” then he stopped. “Since when do you call me ‘Sir’, Plusto. I…don’t remember a Twi’lek on your squad. That’s not even the right helmet for…”The man stumbled back a few steps, and began scrambling for his weapons while shouting out orders to the men behind him. Lucell rolled his eyes; that had lasted a full two seconds. At least this time he’d tried to play nice.Using the brief moment of confusion, Lucell grabbed Keera’s arm and pulled her directly toward the crowd of guards, knowing that the officer would be reluctant to shoot at his own men, especially while they were still trying to sort out what was going on. He weaved through them until they reached the controls.“I’ll cover,” he grunted, ripping off his helmet and shoving a foot into the gut of an attacker. “You get us out of here.”Keera tapped her fingers on the side of her leg anxiously as Lucell tried to talk their way through. One of the guards did notice this and gave her an odd look, why would someone be nervous? He reached his hand for a blaster and Keera, noticing, quickly used a mind trick to tell him to relax and his hand dropped too his side once more.Turning her attention to the conversation at hand and stilling her fidgeting her nerves peaked a little as it seemed like the guard was catching on. The moment it all went to shit and she was dragged into the crowd she had her helmet off, chucking it too the side and crouching down for a moment to make herself a harder target.“Yeah, a way out okay....” she muttered, thinking quickly as she rolled out of the way of an attacker, climbing too her feet. The gateway was chaotic, Officials where scrambling for there weapons and orders where being shouted as confused civilians where shoved out of the way.Turning to the control panel she tapped a few buttons experimentally, they didn’t seem to do anything. honestly at this point she was seriously just considering smashing the bloody thing before she had an idea.Hunting on the uniform for the communicator that she new to be on most outfits of officials she pulled it off, messing with it a little before managing to find a loose panel under the control boards and shoving it in. There was a sharp buzz and some sparking as the device short circuited the controls. And the gate flickered off.“Got it!” She said with a triumphant look before grabbing Lucell by the arm and forcing their way through the crowd, only ever dodging, never drawing her sabers as she had before. Letting him go as they reached the gate she quickly disappeared into the green, managing easily to conceal herself from any unwanted eyes. “A little warning next time?” Lucell grumbled, though he doubted she heard it as she led him through the frantic crowd of citizens and patrolmen. Still, he couldn’t complain too much; she had gotten the door open much quicker than he had expected.He blocked a few more shots fired their way before sheathing his saber so they could move faster. Soon the our two leads  were through the exit and plunging into the misty jungle foliage. Leaving the city behind them

In which two reluctant, forced allies discuss briefly their pasts.





Chapter Text
CHAPTER 1.5InterludeLucell  kept as low as he could as they continued away from the city. It wasn’t until they had gained some distance that he risked speaking.“I think I might have a rough idea of our coordinates,” he said. “And, unfortunately, my ship is still–gah!” He gasped and went for his saber as something scaly and slimy squirmed over his boots and back into the foliage. He relaxed again and shook his head with a scowl. “Is still some miles eastward. It’ll be late by the time we get there. Unless you know of somewhere closer for the time being. How would you rate Felucia’s nightlife in the jungle?”Because the last thing he was in the mood for right now was to wake up to something reminding him he was on the lower end of the food chain.Keera in comparison had grown up here, she knew the jungle and knew its ways, concealing herself was almost second nature and she did it without realizing before remembering she had someone with her. When she did though, she was sure to make her path through the humid, sometimes sticky feeling flora more visible to Lucell. As much as she would have loved to abandon him then and there she had made a deal, and if there was one thing she would never do, it was to go back on an agreement.They continued their way through the wilds for around an hour until keera was well sure they were nor being pursued and the sounds of chaos had been left long behind them. Stopping and beginning to ditch the remainder of the disguise she scrunched her nose a little as a winged bug creature landed on her face. Glancing at him quickly at his surprised exclamation she snickered a little behind her palm, eyes alight with amusement briefly. What did the sith teach in their almighty academy that he was startled by a few lizards anyway? Did they not give them any field training? Oh she could have fun with that knowledge.“Your ship huh? I'd rather sleep out here, but I would not exactly recommend it, thanks to you, however it doesn't look like we have much of a choice” she replied, glancing around their current location to get her own bearings.It wouldn't be the first time she had spent a night in the wilds, here on felucia or on any other planet, even preferred it sometimes. But after the shit show of a day this stupid sith boy had brought upon her she would rather nor take anymore chances. She swore he was a bad luck charm or something.Catching a glimpse of his scowly expression she did grin a little bit. “What? You can take your chances camping on the ground or trying to make it to your ship if you really want but if a rancor comes after you, your on your own” the Twi’lek taunted even though she was dead serious about leaving him for dead.Spend the night out here with the disgusting crawling creatures and a sarcastic Twi’lek or risk it against the rancour?The rancour sounded a little tempting honestly. Especially since he hadn’t wanted this late of a start. But he had noticed she hadn’t ditched him when she could have and he’d have to be an idiot not to honor that.And anyway, the injury in his shoulder was growing increasingly angry at being ignored. In a place like this it could easily get infected if he didn’t tend to it.“Fine,” he sighed, finally ditching the rest of the disguise himself. Then he continued to trudge forward. With the adrenalin beginning to drain from his veins, he was feeling more tired and less inclined to argue.Even before this he’s been having a rather trying week, what with old Drevog constantly finding new and creative ways to test his mettle. And it was only now beginning to sink in.When they did finally find a decent spot for camp, he sunk down and began rummaging through his remaining supplies on his belt for any sort of first aid.  He found some salve that would help with any infection until he could get some real help and began rubbing it where the knife had landed.He looked over at the Twi’lek, who seemed completely in her element out here, and tried not to envy her for it.“I’m assuming this is something like a home planet for you. Bold of the Jedi to take a young force sensitive right out from under the noses of imperial city leadership.”He meant it as a compliment, though in his current state he doubted it sounded that way.Keera nodded in approval at his resignation. “ good, come on then” she replied, some small part of her admittedly wanting to see how he would hold up against a beast such as a rancor and almost found herself comparing the two. They where both aggressive, Brutish creatures, maybe they’d be friends? With that thought to amuse her she continued to guide him through the familiar to her terrain.This was going to be so much more trouble now. She was already so tired, mainly mentally but physically was also catching up to her as the adrenaline faded. She never could sleep much on ships, the noises kept her awake and as such her journey back here had been restless. Not to mention the toll of expectation always looming over her shoulder.As they finally stopped, Keera finding a decently high tree to be safe from the floor dwellers, she finally became aware of her own injures as the burns on the side of her face twinged painfully. Wincing as she lightly touched her face, she glanced around, annoyingly not finding the plant she was looking for. giving an irratated sigh she leant back against the trunk of the tree like plant, tracing her fingers tiredly over the damaged skin and using the force to reverse some of the damage. A trick she had only recently learnt how to do.She looked down at him as he tended to his own injures, but looked away before he noticed, hesitating before deciding she was too tired to bother with being snarky back at him and nodded.“Yes, my family didn’t... exactly agree with my master wanting to take me to train, so I ran away”  she shrugged, dropping her hand to her side once more, looking off into the distance where she new her home village resided, not far from here. But the last thing she wanted was to go back and face her family again.“Perhaps I should say it was bold of /you/, then.”He followed her gaze off toward the green horizon, idly wondering what her village was like. He imagined they weren’t the biggest fans of the Jedi anymore—if they ever had been at all.But then reputation didn’t hold much when compared to gaining a new force sensitive, did it? Just look at the Sith. They’d happily destroy towns and force slaves into their academy if it meant new recruits.“How old were you?” He asked, just out of curiosity. Because running off to join the Jedi was a life altering decision even for an adult to make. Let alone a youth.And because the conversation was a nice distraction. Tired as he was, he wasn’t eager to attempt sleep. Sticky surroundings aside, everything had become so peaceful this far outside of the city. So quiet. And his screwed up mind didn’t do very well in quiet. It left too much space that his pet demons were all too eager to fill.Still, he supposed it could be worse. He could be wandering aimlessly around the galaxy wasting resources and arguing with fleet captains. All the while knowing he was essentially on his way to hand over his own head on a platter.If that was what his master had coined “the easy way”, he didn’t want any part of it.Keera gave a quiet chuckle, “bold, maybe.. some would say dishonest, maybe even cowardly. “ in all honesty she wasn’t sure why she was giving him this information, but if they where going to work together then she supposed it was only fair. Her home had been huge on honour, a place full of warriors who believed that dying to protect those you cared for was the greatest honour of all. Something a young Keera hadn’t particularly liked the idea of. So when the opportunity was offered to her to not have to live up to that a young, impulsive Keera had taken it with open arms.Giving a quiet sigh she continued. “I was 10.”The conversation was a nice distraction admittedly. The quiet familarity of their surrounds calmed her, but with the calm came the allowance of room for her mind to run. Now that she wasn’t so worried about not dying or getting thrown into some jail cell she had time to look back on the events that had actually transpired, and the self doubt came creeping back in.What had she done wrong back there? Surely she could have handled that differently and with less confrontation. Lucells sudden intercept of her contact had thrown her off more than it should have, should she just have taken him at his word maybe? No, this was too important for that, too much relied on her...Shaking her head to clear it she took a water skin from her side, something she always made sure to carry, and took a sip. Turning her head to look past the Sith continuing that trend of never looking directly at him she gestured to him with it.“What about you then? How does one become the apprentice of such a Sith Lord? Asides from the obvious back stabbery” she prompted. That was something she never quiet understood about the Sith. Their whole tradition of killing eachother.Lucell  chuckled humorlessly. “Well there’s really not much left once you cut out the backstabbery.”He gratefully took the water skin and took a swig. Then rested his arms on his knees and, with a shrug, answered simply: “I was bred for it.” Like a dog.He handed the waterskin back, which took a minute since she was still refusing to look at him apparently. He then pulled his hood over his head against the growing chill and settled back into the rough surface of the tree, deciding he’d  probably better give her a real answer if he wanted to maintain her half an ounce of trust.“My parents both come from strong Empire and Sith lines. The only real reason for their union was a carefully calculated offspring to earn them more status. It was pretty easy after that. Father knew the best trainers. Mother knew the best nutritionists and healers. And both had ample connections.” He shrugged again, his words flat and emotionless. “Darth Drevog was practically beside himself when he saw my underage ass trying to survive in the academy. A few former masters out of the way, and I was as good as his.”There were worlds more to it, of course, but he didn’t feel any inclination to share. He had rattled off only what anyone else who knew him knew about him. Just as he was certain she had done. Just enough for two people to reasonably work together without hopefully creating as big of a scene next time.“But only ten, huh?” he glanced over at her from behind his hood then back at the oddly colored sunset. “It’s not cowardice to know what you want.”Letting someone else decide for you. That was cowardice.After some time and some mental mapping out of how they could reach his ship the next morning, Lucell did eventually fall into an uneasy sleep. His dreams were full of annoying droids, interrogating bright eyes, shouting patrolmen, and the terrorized faces of his victims. But another chance for sleep meant, at the very least, that he had lived to see another day.The offering of the flask was her way of expressing a truce between them, and uneasy one, but a truce nonetheless. Keera was intrigued by his answer, from what she knew of the Sith it didn’t particularly surprise her, but it was still unusual, even a little sad.Taking back the flask after catching a glimpse of him offering it back to her on the edge of her vision she re-attached it to her waist once more. The emotionlessness of his response only left her questioning more. Sith were ruled by there emotions from what she’d been taught but he didn’t seem to hold any anger, any hatred towards the memories.Strange. Maybe some of her teachings where wrong after all.“Sounds pretty loveless, guess I kinda understand why all you Sith are so angry all the time now, your lonely” She hummed contemplatively. The Jedi code didn’t exactly support emotional attachment either, but it was a part of the code many, including her, ignored anyway.As the conversation fell to silence, she yawned a little behind her hand and made her way up to a low branch of the tree, instinctively not wanting to be on the ground at night. Pulling her robes around her for warmth and with memories of the past, strangers turned hesitant allies and plans gone wrong she too drifted off into an uneasy sleep."

Something he would be able to choose, something that actually has a flavor, something that isnt just a off-white mush.",2023-03-08,"Work Text:

After the years Melshi spent in the unchanging sameness of Narkina 5, everything felt so new and exciting. 

Clothing in colors different than white and orange, thick and soft against his skin. Salty smell of the ocean, sand scratching his palms when he sat down on the beach. Wind in his face, and sun, and fog in the morning before it gets too warm. People's voices, loud without constantly looking over your shoulder. 

Food. Such a small, selfish thing. Food that had an actual smell and taste to it, instead of a pale mush that was vaguely sweet on special days. Now he could choose what he wanted - within the limits of his budget - and it was enough to make his head spin. 

He returned to the hotel room with a bag full of boxes and packages and satchels of things he'd mostly never seen before, but that smelled so great it took all of his willpower not to just tear into it right there on the street. 

At random, he picked one of the still warm containers, thin foil sides stained with grease from its fried contents - small cubes in a crispy coating, dots of different colors promising a bit of spice. He picked one up. It creaked slightly in his teeth. Most of the taste was in the thin outer layer, the innards were mild and springy like…

Like a greasy sponge. Shivers run down his spine. He swallowed, and the cube thudded into his stomach like a ball-bearing. He pushed the container away. Maybe deep frying wasn't the brightest choice for the first post-Narkina meal. 

The next bag was hiding some kind of pastry that smelled of fruit and was covered in a thick layer of powdered sugar. They even looked a bit familiar, like something he used to eat when he was little. He took a big bite out of it. The filling was tart and the pastry itself light and flaky, but the sugar made his teeth hurt like he'd just bitten into a blanket. He frowned, blowing the sugar off. It made a sticky mess all around, but it didn't help. He could still remember that awful feeling, and he barely finished one with no appetite for the rest of them.

Some sort of dumplings on a skewer, drenched in a sticky sauce and grilled, soft and tasty looking, but they smelled so strongly of smoke that he couldn't stop thinking about every morning after someone had taken the step, how the smoke lingered in the air, soaking into your hair and staying there even after multiple showers. He couldn't even manage a single bite and threw them away. Into a dustbin in the hall. The smell was too strong to let them stay in the same room as him.

Sweet, porridge-like cold mixture was almost okay, until he bit into a dry lump of something and thought he's going to throw it all up again, lying up on the bed curled up and heaving.

He managed to finish a cup of cloyingly sweet drink, avoiding the little jelly cubes and spheres swimming in it.

Bowl of shredded meat with vegetables. He picked out and ate the green and yellow bits, but the meat itself was stringy and too salty and hid an occasional cartilage and he didn't have the courage to try. 

It felt like every single try just broke something in his head a little more, turning things that used to be safe and familiar into something new, suspicious, dangerous.

Too slimy. Too strong. Too crunchy. Too strange. Too much.
 
When Cassian returned from his own errands across the city, Melshi was sitting on the floor, opened containers of food strewn around but basically untouched, eating a protein bar mashed up with water. It was the closest he could get to what he was used to from Narkina."

Chapter Text
They were fiery. They were reckless. They were convinced of their own opinions and determined to see those through, regardless of whatever was in the way. They were youths, in short. All three of them: peas in a pod: a naturally occurring triad of three different species with similar names, and they were all proud of it all: Tar, Tre and T’ra. And then it all crashed and burnt in a cascade of horrible, horrible things: Amma went missing, then Té who searched for them alone, then both were gone, then the so-called Ruusan Reformation was put in place by the heavily limping, fearful Republic and equally fearful Jedi High Council, then the Republic carpet-bombed Manda’yaim and so many were lost in it so gruesomely, so suddenly, so senselessly. And here Tre-Fay Viz has been since then: floating in the Outer Rim and Wild Space and beyond on the currents of the universe, helping where she can, mourning whom she cannot help, distant from her surviving kin and people, wearing neither Jedi robes nor Mando’ad armour, numb and nearly as raw as centuries ago when it all happened. But now the currents call her home, call her to her armour and only her armour, and she follows the promptings as she always does. She strips most of the old paints but leaves the symbols be. She is still a Viz and part of the triad and a Soul-of-Stars, after all, and she has earned the honours bestowed on her. But she has forsaken her duties except for the barest concepts of them all these centuries; she can no longer claim valor in her heart, having cowardly avoided nearly all traces of her family all this time; and, given all those, how can she say that she is reliable, let alone honouring her family? She keeps strips of justice black on her helmet, as she has done her best to uphold it wherever she goes. But now she adds new-path light blue to the plates, and mourning grey, and makes both the prevailing theme of her armour. She is still very much mourning what was, after all, but also doing her best to look forward and onward. Who knows, after this mission she might even reconnect with the kin and people she has neglected for so long, including her own surviving triad sibling T’ra.









Chapter 2: All, Painted Over
    




Chapter Text
Children are easy prey to adults in so many ways. They are even easy prey among themselves. Fay knows this well. She, Té and Ra have experienced it once. Té even had to endure a stint as a child slave for a little while, having been betrayed by fellow children of the clan. And then they were betrayed once more, barely into their adulthood, barely into the more peaceful part of their reign as mand’alor, by a clan member bearing part of her name. Fay shakes her head fiercely to that, trying to dislodge it from her thoughts as quickly as possible. She needs to pay attention to her current mission, not dwell on what was. Not right now. Other child slaves need her now. Slaves concealed behind the façade of a very nice if segregating “orphanage for non-human species.” Backed by wealthy, powerful businesspeople and the local government. It is good that she wears her armour and brings along a few sets of undercover outfits for other options, then. She will not accidentaly implicate the current Jedi Order, this way – the toothless, enchained beings that they are now, fully in obeyance of the Republic whose local government has enabled this. It is also good that she has replenished her medical kit and ammunitions, with extras of both. She will need them, she knows. She might even need the firepower and other capabilities of her beloved, trusty Whistling Bird 3, her old starfighter that Alyé has thankfully kept cared for, up-to-date and hidden for her all these centuries, and how thankful she is that she is flying in it now. Jon, Knol, Nico and little Yad’ika have promised to meet up with her on planet for this mission, too. She is not alone. No, she is not alone. And she has the bad feeling that she will need their companionship and support soon.









Chapter 3: Not Only My Paint
    




Chapter Text
The obsequious, unctuous, sycophantic greed hinted in the attitude of the owner of the “orphanage” is… surprising, when faced with a fully armed, fully armoured Mando’ad. But how he sees the paints – and perhaps also the symbols? – and then promises that “the package will be delivered on time this time” is definitely alarming, and Fay itches to get right down to it immediately. She cannot, though; not right now, at any rate. She is just scouting ahead while waiting for her backup, and the backup regretably will take some more time to assemble. After all, they are now not just fellow wanderers and her little one, as Alyé insisted to come along when she fetched Whistling Bird 3, and Ra likewise when she reconnected with the latter through their bond as they regretably rarely do nowadays, and they are all from different corners of the galaxy. And, as part of her scouting, “I want to see the children.” Blunt. To the point. Normal in Mandalorian Space. Rude in Republic Space. But the disgusting, disgustingly fat twi’lek in front of her takes it in stride, in the way that suggests it as usual for him. `Lots of dealings with the rougher side of the Republic? Or with Mando’ad’e?` That last part is the most disgusting of all, if it is true. And, judging by how the children that the twi’lek then gathers for her “inspection” recognise and cower away from her, it is even more likely than not. `A new Demagol? Or several of them?` Her heart plummets to somewhere at the bottom of her guts, it feels. And it slides icily, slimily down to the sole of her feet when one of the oldest children, one foot deformed and face young but eyes so, so old and weary, glares hatefully at the symbol of her triad painted on her beskar’ta when the slaver is looking away. `Who else have been using our symbol, Ra?` she sends to her remaining triad sibling, alongside all the shock-alarm-dismay-disgust she feels. Rueful-guilty-sad is what answers her at first. Then Ra admits, `I haven’t been in touch with Manda’yaim and its surroundings for a long time, Ré. But, tangentially, I know of three loudest factions that have been fighting with each other lately: the so-called Death Watch, True Mandalorians and New Mandalorians.` Ludicrous names, all. Fay tells her sibling just that. She gets a mirthless laugh for the acerbic remark and an admonishing mental nudge, accompanied with, `But true nonetheless. Be careful, Ré.` That parting statement echoes loomingly in her mind. And perhaps it is why she damn flinches when a vocoded voice demands from just outside of the room, “To’leh! Where’s the package?” And when the speaker barges in…. `Oh. Oh! Stars, how could it be?`"
