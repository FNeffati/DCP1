Today of all days the Skywalker home was bustling with preparations, noise and as always baby complaints.Anakin was happy he survived the first 12 months of Luke and Leia’s lives without causing some disaster. That aside he was ecstatic and excited for the first time in a very long time. Why?It was Life Day! As well as the twins’ first birthday.  It was going to be an exciting couple of hours. Padme decided to throw the most lavish private birthday party for the her babies and Anakin ….well his mind was entirely elsewhere.It was completely taken by Leia’s birthday dress! It was a little pink dress with a tutu.“How can someone be so cute and so destructive at the same time?“Oh wow have you looked in a mirror lately Ani?” Padme retorted back as she continued fixing her daughter’s outfit.Leia was giggling and moving around on the bed. She was as always restless. Dressing Luke was much easier and faster… was that why Anakin chose to do it earlier?“Hey that’s…. actually fair I am extraordinarily good looking.“And destructive“And destructive yes”Padme sighed in contempt when she was finally able to put the finishing touches on her daughter. “Look at them they are so adorable!” she cooed at the sight of her two children all pampered and dressed up for their first birthday.“Yeah they are” he said. As he watched his children moving around on the bed, the reality of things seemed to hit him…“… it’s been…. a year already. to think that one year ago I was on the verge of aiding in galactic destruction and now I’m a father of two”Padme turned to her husband and cupped his face in her hands “yes and now look, you’re fine no more pain. See how much can change in one year? With a bit of hope and the right people around you”Padme knew that Anakin had these moments more times than most. What he had been through left so many scars and damage on him. Accepting that things worked out and he finally found his peace was a long process for him. She knew his paranoia was not helping him adjusting properly but he was trying…. He was trying to maintain his happiness.Anakin smiled and pulled her to him “not people, just one amazing and perfect woman. Just you.” He kissed her forehead then her lips tenderly “you saved my soul”As he was about to dive in again, Luke crawled to the edge of the bed silently and held on to his mother’s dress, interrupting the pair.“It seems he doesn’t like the open display of affection” said Padme lifting him up in her arms.“No he doesn’t indeed, alright Luke she’s all yours” Anakin said, taking some steps from his wife.Padme was completely infatuated with her son, just as Anakin was practically obsessed with his daughter.Luke was playing with strands of his mother’s curly hair and babbling excitedly.“Ma….Mama!”Padme gasped “Anakin did you hear that?“Mama!” he repeated with a grin.Anakin was on his way to the bedroom door when he heard his son. He was …amazed.“Eum …I think so I … did he just call you?”“Luke say that again sweetie”“Mama mama mama!!”Padme had never felt this happy in her life as in this moment. She felt the tears stinging her eyes as Luke got more excited and repeated the word. The baby could feel his mother’s emotions in the force and it encouraged him to continue what he was doing.“He said mama, he called me Anakin his first word is mama”Anakin was holding Leia in his arms and adjusted her. He got closer to his son “yeah… his first words” he said as he held the baby’s little hand. Anakin had developed the habit of reading his son through the force. The pair shared a strong force-bond. They were linked to one another, it was fascinating every time.“Padme you’re going to cry?“Of course I am I’m witnessing my son’s first words”Anakin chuckled as he kissed her temple “well you have plenty of other firsts to cry about but not in a birthday party.” He delicately wiped the single tear that rolled on her cheek away.“Oh you’re just petty because he’s calling me not you” she joked with a chuckle.“What? That’s ridiculous, I’m not petty or jealous…. Okay maybe just a little bit.”Padme rolled her eyes “you’re so competitive”He shrugged “well I won’t argue with that”“You hear that Luke daddy’s jealous, keep it up”For their first birthday, Anakin and Padme had decided to keep the event private. This was one of the most important moments for their family. There were plenty of other birthdays to celebrate with guests and family friends.The whole apartment was joyfully decorated and Padme had made it that it was the brightest decoration and … the most expensive.“It’s such a coincidence that their birthday is Life Day as well” said Padme as she set Luke on her lap as she sat on the couch.“Yeah … Life Day”Anakin’s only memorable Life Day was when he was 7 years old with his mother. It was purely coincidence that she was not as busy and Watoo for once let her be. It was the best Life Day he’d ever had.His mother made her best efforts to cook something special and gifted Anakin his first mechanic tools. He had started on 3-PO around that time. It was modest but the joy stayed with him for the many years to come… until today.Anakin had never  paid much mind to holidays and occasions. Heck he’d lost count of the number of birthdays that went by without him caring. He never had much to celebrate. He didn’t care for his birthday, so what ? it was some random day each year, nothing to celebrate. And Life Day? The jedi weren’t too keen on celebrations. Each Life Day there would be some master making some speech about life and companions…. A boring speech Anakin never paid attention to. It seemed empty words with no real emotion.Then the war had started and there was only ever a sharp instinct of survival in his mind. Life …Death … Anakin had blurred the lines between them countless times. He’d nearly died so many times that life itself lost its importance to him. His life was worth nothing to him. The only times he found any sort of meaning was when he was reunited with his wife…. as rare as it was during the three years of senseless war.Anakin had lost meaning during the war… something he’d only regained recently thanks to his children.Anakin had completely disconnected with his surroundings for a moment and Padme gave him space. She was taking pictures and showing Luke around. The apartment looked very different for the baby boy. Then she lit up the candles, one for each twin.Luke and Leia were getting more excited as they saw their mother so happy. She sung happy birthday to them Anakin just watched from the side. She was an amazing mother … and just as amazing partner.Leia in his arms was completely fascinated by the candles sparks. He smiled “ don’t get too close to the fire princess” he whispered to her.Fire…Lava …Mustafar‘stop’ he thought to himself ‘ stop …. Stop it’He had not gone there but he had received his orders. He almost committed a massacre. He was almost the end of the jedi… he almost destroyed everything.“Ani?”Padme’s voice pulled him out of his spiraling thoughts.“Hmm yeah?“Weren’t you listening?“Eum… sorry no I zoned out for a while”Padme smiled and offered him a slice of cake “that’s alright, cake?“I really don’t…. like sweets“Come on Leia will be really mad look at her”Leia was innocently gazing at her father as if taking his features in for the first time. Her innocent round eyes made him smile. “Okay princess just a little”True Anakin didn’t like any sugary or sweet things but this cake was not as bad as it looked. But then Leia took all his attention as she decided that his wedding ring was the most interesting thing today.“What you want see it? You like it?”He took it off and levitated it with the force which made Leia gasp but then laugh excitedly. The girl was fascinated with the force and loved it each time her father used it.***Around lunch time, the twins had tired themselves out and both put to sleep. Anakin had noticed that their being twins resulted in almost identical feeding time and sleeping. They were linked and it was curious for him.After putting them to sleep and making sure they stayed so, Anakin went by the window drinking from a glass of wine absent-mindedly “finally asleep and rested” said Padme “ they are tiring” she approached him and rested her head on his shoulder “ what’s wrong love? You haven’t really been yourself all day“…nothing just memories crashing.“Bad ones?”“I don’t know…” he sighed “I’m alright, don’t think about it Angel.“You’ve been a little absent minded all morning… is it about Life Day?“I just remembered my mother. Maybe it’s also because it’s been a year since the chaos ended or some other reason but I keep thinking about last year too.“Year-ends always feel odd Anakin, you’re just nostalgic”He smiled a little bittersweet smile as he set his glass aside and turned to his wife.“… It’s been a year since I almost made the worse mistake of my life, since that vision I had of you. Since ….. I almost lost my mind. I think about that day every once in a while. If I didn’t wait in the council room and went after Windu instead. What choice would I have done? Would I have still done the right thing… or…“You don’t have to think about it Anakin, the important thing is that it didn’t happen. You’re here now you’re healing and learning new things every day. Don’t think about the council or Palpatine or anything else.“…. I’ve listened to Palpatine for 10 years what if I’m his ticking time-bomb? What if….-The conflict and dear dancing in his azure eyes was nothing foreign for Padme to see in his eyes. But she hadn’t seen it in so long. Somehow today woke old feelings and doubts in her husband. This wasn’t just nostalgia, this was his old fears coming back to haunt him.“He’s away from you he can’t manipulate you anymore my love, don’t worry”Anakin nodded “why are year ends so … annoying?“You’re reflecting on what you’ve accomplished this year that happens. Do you think I’m not thinking as well?” she asked then she smiled and added “Do you remember when I came home and found you asleep on the couch with Luke on your chest? I made an unnecessary fuss about it”She was trying to distract his mind from any other thoughts and memories.Anakin chuckled “Yeah you woke me I almost freaked out and dropped him”“What about the other time, when I almost poured flour instead of milk powder in Leia’s bottle because I was distracted with a communication. Thank goodness you have good reflexes”Anakin nodded “yeah, thankfully I’m always here“My hero” she giggled and pulled him into a quick kiss but Anakin held her closer and continued kissing her.He wasn’t letting go, gently caressing her cheek with his cybernetic hand he pressed her body against his and wrapped an arm around her delicate waist.“What was that for?” she asked.“Nothing… I’m happy thanks to you”“So am I Ani”Suddenly Anakin felt a sharp pain in his head and knew it was a call through the force. He groaned and recoiled from his wife “ouch what the hell…”“A-are you okay?“Yeah….it’s just… weird I just felt something I can’t explain through the force“Generally when even you can’t explain it then it’s related to the twins” she said worriedly then rushed to the nursery, followed by her husband.“Oh my god!!!” he heard her exclaim.“What? What’s happening?” he asked as he entered the room some seconds after her.In her crib Leia was… standing up.“Holy…shit she’s …“She’s standing”.Padme stood by the crib and took her daughter’s hand. “she’s trying to walk”“Yeah she is….”Leia’s stumbled back on her mattress with a happy giggle.  Anakin looked at Luke and realized it was him who called through the force. He called him to help his sister.Anakin walked to Luke in his crib and lifted him in his arms “you are exceptional little guy, do you know that? First words, first birthday and communicating almost clearly with the force for the first time? That’s a lot of accomplishments for one day don’t you think?”Luke was sucking his pacifier and happily fidgeting in this father’s arms.“What’s next? You’re stealing my lightsaber? I don’t think so little one” he said kissing his son on the forehead.It was at that moment that Anakin realized….It didn’t matter what happened in the past, his mistakes, his near decent to the dark side, Palpatine. None of that mattered. All of that truly mattered for him was this moment.The fact he’d lived long enough to witness every single one of his children’s firsts. The past was past. Now he had to look to the future."

STAR WARS


Cue the scrolling text:


THE BATTLE OF NABOO Luke Skywalker is still training his Jedi students at Dagobah, whilst the Rebel Alliance camps out there, waiting to assist anyone in distress. During their stay, the rebels receive a message from the Queen of Naboo inviting Luke, Leia and the Rebels for dinner in the City of Theed. Unsure if it is a trick, the Rebels decide to go to Naboo anyway to investigate and be ready for whatever peril awaits them. Fortunately for our heroes, they’ll get what they have expected……





The X-Wings and Millennium Falcon flew toward Naboo.  “It’ll finally be great to get away from that dump!” Han remarked about Dagobah.  “Hey, that was my master’s planet,” said Luke.  “No offense, Luke, but your master needed better taste,” said Han.  “Just like you need better manners,” snarked Leia.  Chewie chuckled.  “Shut up, Chewie,” said Han.  “Still, I am excited to see the motherland,” said Luke.  “R2 was created in Naboo, and he saved the Queen’s ship,” C-3PO told them.  R2 bleeped.  “Good boy,” said Leia.   The ships arrived at Naboo and they headed toward a massive hangar in the city of Theed. There was a massive crowd that awaited them. “The children of Padme Amidala have arrived!” The people cheered like crazy.  The Falcon and X-Wings landed. Our heroes exited their ships and the people swarmed them like crazy.  “Our adoring public,” said Leia.  “Looks like I have a lot of autographs to sign,” said Han.  “Her majesty, The Queen!” announced a herald.  Everyone was dead silent as the Queen arrived with her many captains and handmaidens.  They were face to face with Luke, Leia and the rebels.  “The Skywalker children,” the Queen greeted with a smile. “It is an honor to have you in our city.” “We’re honored,” Leia greeted back. Just then, fruit hit Luke and Leia on the heads.  “MURDERERS!” yelled a voice.  “Not him again,” said one of the Captains. The culprit was a man, about 40 with silver hair. He was not happy to see Luke and Leia.  “Their father murdered many in Coruscant, and you’re happy to see them?” the man asked in disgust. “They should be arrested! MURDERERS!” “THAT’S IT!” snapped one of the Captains. “YOU HAVE WARNED ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR! LETS GO!” The man was then arrested and taken away to the jailhouse. “I’m very sorry about this,” the Captain said to Luke and Leia.  Luke and Leia knew what was wrong with that man: “He’s a Sith,” Luke whispered.  “We don’t want to worry anybody,” Leia whispered back. “Let’s leave it for now until things get worse.” “My apologies,” said the Queen. “That man will be punished.” “Thank you,” said Luke and Leia.  “In the meantime, the feast will begin shortly,” announced the Queen.  Everyone cheered.  But Han and Chewie were not happy. They were angry about that guy.  “Chewie and I are going to that jail and we’ll give this guy…….!”Han began to say.  “Han, leave it for now,” Leia told him. “You can visit him later.” “I’m just angry about…….,” Han said again.  “It’s nice that you care,” Leia replied with a smile.  The Rebels followed the Queen, her captains and her handmaidens to the Palace.





They all sat at a very long table. A feast to fill an army and with plenty of booze. His was going to be one great feast.


After the fantastic meal, it was evening, and everyone was drinking and dancing. A band played music. Although Luke and Leia were having a good time, they had to be on their toes in case Sith escaped.  And sure enough, he did….




At the jailhouse, the guards got a visit from four shifty looking figures about in their early 20’s.  “What are you doing here?” a guard asked them.  One of the figures pulled out a red lightsaber and struck at the guards.  They reached the Sith’s cell and used the force to pull the door open.  “Master,” they said as they handed him his lightsaber.  “I did warn those fools, but no,” said the Sith. “I had to come to this.”






Back at the party: “STORMTROOPERS!” Everyone looked out of the windows and saw a massive group of Stormtroopers all firing their blasters at the citizens.  Luke and Leia pulled out their lightsabers and leapt from the balcony and onto the ground right in front of the Stormtroopers.  “Hello boys,” Leia greeted. Then she and Luke slashed their sabers at the troopers.  “Chewie, protect the Queen,” Han instructed the Wookie, as he pulled out his blaster and began shooting at the Stormtroopers from the window.  Lando and other rebels joined in as well.  The Stormtroopers were coming into the palace, but they were confronted by the rebels who blasted them all down.  The Stormtroopers were defeated, but not the Sith students. They made their way to the entrance of the palace and struck down the rebels with their lightsabers.  As the four Siths made it to the Throne room, Chewie pointed his crossbow at them and was ready to fire.  “Ah ah ah……” said the Sith master, who was right behind his students.  He had his hand out and was using the Force to choke the Queen.  “Put down your weapon and I will let her go,” said the Sith master. Chewie growled with rage. But then he put his crossbow down. The Sith Master let go and the Queen gasped for breath.  The Sith Master walked up to the balcony and announced to the people.  “People of Theed, do as I say, or I will kill your queen!” Luke, Leia and the Rebels knew they were done for as they were surrounded by Stormtroopers pointing their blasters at them.  Just then, Luke used the Force to talk to Leia.  “Leia, you must go to Gungan City and seek help.” “I will. Good luck.” And then Leia vanished into thin air.  Everyone gasped. “Where did she go?” asked one of the Siths.  “We’ll find her later, in the meantime, we have one Skywalker,” sneered the Sith Master. 






The invisible Leia walked away from the city until she was out of sight from the many Stormtroopers. She made herself visible again and and ran off toward the swamps that led to Gungan City. When she got there, saw a few Gungan teengers drinking booze by the river. “Whoa!” cried a Gungan teen. “Issa General Leia!” “The daughter of Amidala!” cried another.  “Theed is under attack and we need your help,” said Leia.  “Princess Leia wants ussa help?” asked another Gungan teen. “Super Bombad!”

Chapter Text
Based on The Book of Boba Fett, Chapter 5 - Return of the MandalorianGrogu’s DiaryTime for Meditation Practice with Master Luke…Location: MeadowGrogu understood that Master Luke wanted him to meditate. But Grogu couldn’t help but worry about the Mandalorian. Din Djarin had only sent Grogu with Luke because he realized that it was pretty easy for a person using a lightsaber to cut up a bunch of battle droids. Grogu wished that Din had simply asked Luke for one. It would have made everything easier.First, without Grogu to look after him, what would Din Djarin do if he got hurt? Or lost? Or lonely? He’d probably go back to bounty hunting. Yech. Bounty hunting had been a noble profession when the people they were collecting were actual bad actors and criminals. But it was hard to say that was the case. After all, look at how Grogu and Din met! Grogu hadn’t done anything wrong. Why would you kidnap someone and think it was a good thing?Anyway, Grogu could just imagine Din taking a bounty puck to help him earn the credits to replace the Razor Crest. He’d probably have to go someplace dangerous. And he’d end up meeting a bunch of bad people who would want to hurt him. People like a Klatooinian syndicate boss.Din would walk into wherever that guy was and try to not freak out the other people there. That would be hard to do because Mandalorian’s had a reputation for being dangerous and very hard to kill. That whole hunter and prey thing.Eventually he’d find the person. That guy would probably be sitting around and counting his credits. Grogu was pretty sure that’s what the bad guys did that got them into all that trouble to begin with. They stole, or skimmed, or otherwise obtained credits that didn’t actually belong to them. If you’re going to do that, you’re going to count them.He could just see the Mandalorian politely explaining that the person could decide if they wanted to come in cold or warm. They never really picked warm, even if they thought they did. The bad people usually did something or said something that made it impossible for the Mandalorian to bring them in warm.Without Grogu by his side to guide him, Din would bring this person in very cold. Like head in a bag cold. Ooooh. That gave Grogu a bad case of the shivers. He’d seen worse but he still didn’t like to think of it. He couldn’t imagine how hard doing that must be to the Mandalorian. He was a pretty gentle person, all things considered. Taking someone’s life was never his preferred way of solving a problem.The people who know the deceased would likely be pretty sad about it, right? But knowing the Mandalorian, Grogu was certain that he would treat them fairly. He had no doubt that Din would offer them the credits because he didn’t need them. He’d have the head to give to people who put out the bounty. He’d get paid.Any way, a person bad enough for Din Djarin to go after them probably wasn’t treating the people they knew very well. It seemed likely to Grogu that those folks had probably been cheated too and it would only be fair for them to get their credits back. His friend, the Mandalorian, would be doing them a favor.But could he do all that without getting hurt? Grogu didn’t think so. Even if he used the Darksaber, it was pretty likely that Din would still have something bad happen. Grogu wondered if he could heal the Mandalorian from so far away… he’d have to ask Master Luke when they were done with meditation time.









Chapter 2: Way finding or following the Way?
    


Summary:

Grogu and Luke are working on Jedi skills. They just aren't working on the same skills at the same time. Grogu was thinking about the Mandalorian and what he was experiencing (practicing empathy). Luke was talking at him about being in the moment. Whatever.

Grogu is telling this story as he imagines it happened, while he spends his time on Ossus, attending Luke's Jedi Sleep Away Camp.




Chapter Text
Time for Skills Practice with Master Luke…Location: PathwayGrogu was sad. Master Luke didn’t really give him a straight answer about being able to heal a person (the Mandalorian) from a vast distance. Master Luke said, “Grogu, focus on the now. You are here with me now. We do not know where the Mandalorian is or what he is doing.”Grogu didn’t really believe that. He could feel Din Djarin in his heart and he knew the Mandalorian was lonely. He’d probably brought the head in a bag to the person who set up the bounty. Grogu bet he told that person to put the head on ice, like that was going to make it less gross. That’s a Mandalorian for you.And while he would at least have the credits he needed to build or buy a ship, he still wouldn’t have Grogu with him. Credits didn’t really cure loneliness.For loneliness you need to have people you care about or at least tolerate in your life. Grogu bet that Din was looking for the other Mandalorians. He always wanted to see them when things were getting rough. Grogu had no doubt that they were somewhere nearby the Mandalorian. Hidden in plain sight. They were good at that. Probably why the covert was called the covert.Grogu had taken to calling Luke’s Jedi Training School, a sleep away Jedi camp, because they spent all of their time outside. Once the mech ants finished building the buildings he’d think about calling it a school. But it wasn’t a covert. Not like how the Mandalorians did things.Grogu looked up as he heard Master Luke call his name. He gave him a quizzical look because that one always worked out the best. If he gave Luke his ‘I’m sad and I don’t really like being here’ look, he be on the receiving end of a fresh edition of the ‘Jedi don’t do attachments’ lecture. Grogu preferred to only hear that lecture once a day.“Grogu, Jedi have to practice way finding. To that you will need…” Master Luke was droning on. Grogu wondered if Din Djarin was being droned at by the other Mandalorians. He was pretty sure that the Armorer was great at delivering lectures. He wondered if Din was being lectured about taking his helmet off so Grogu could see his face? It seemed likely.Grogu knew that the Creed or the Way prohibited Mandalorians from removing their helmets in front of other people. But honestly that was a bit silly to him. Din had to partially remove the helmet just to eat. Up a little, take a bite or a sip, then right back down. Over and over and over. Grogu appreciated that he would never see how messy or neat an eater the Mandalorian really was, but wearing the helmet seemed pretty odd to him.But then maybe because Din had the Darksaber now the Armorer would honor him as their new Mand’alor and Din could change the rules and let everyone take their helmet off when they needed to or at least with their family. That would be nice, right?But if the other Mandalorians saw that Din had the Darksaber would they be happy for him or mad? What if they wanted the silly thing? What if he had to fight them? What if he got hurt? How could he be so far away from Grogu, getting hurt and being scolded without the help of his favorite pal? That just didn’t seem right. Grogu had so much and the Mandalorian had so little.“Grogu? Grogu, are you listening to me or do I need to review the ten points of way finding again for you?” Master Luke sounded a bit out of sorts.Grogu smiled at him and pointed to the path. The first rule of way finding is know where you are. Grogu knew right where he was and that it wasn’t where he wanted to be. Time for a meal with Master Luke…Location: Lakeside“Well, Grogu, you’ve done a lot today. I know it isn’t easy going from your old routine to a new routine. I had the same problem when I first started to train with Obi-Wan Kenobi. I knew him as Ben Kenobi. He’d been a good friend to me when I was growing up. But then I had to put aside the things I did as a youngling and pick up the responsibilities of the Jedi. You were trained by many masters. I am just here to help you remember that training. And… perhaps teach you something new. But I need you to cooperate. You need to be focused and attentive…”Grogu was certain that Luke’s words were important. After all the Jedi had once been an important part of keeping peace in the galaxy. He wasn’t sure how they lost their way, but he was pretty sure it wasn’t because he hadn’t been paying attention. Master Obi-Wan had once told him that ‘distraction is a sign that your mind needs a break’ or words to that effect.Grogu wanted to take a break from thinking about Jedi responsibilities and consider his clan responsibilities. How could the Mudhorn clan survive if the two clan members were far apart from each other? What if the Armorer did more than just lecture Din about the helmet thing? What if they didn’t care that Din was the defect Mand’alor? Din couldn’t be a Mandalorian any more. If Din couldn’t be a Mandalorian would Grogu still be a Mandalorian foundling?He kind of wanted to ask Master Luke that question, but he wasn’t sure if this was a good time. Luke was still blabbing about the duties and responsibilities of a Jedi Knight and how he hoped to rebuild the order. Grogu looked at the lake and thought he saw the reflection of the Mandalorian! He held his hand out and used the Force to see what was there and found himself holding up a big shiny fish.He coo’d at Luke, who finally stopped talking at him and looked at the water.“Very good, Grogu. Providing food is a responsibility that the Jedi take seriously.  Focus and bring it to us. This will make an excellent meal.” Luke seemed really happy even though Grogu was disappointed in himself.Maybe next time.









Chapter 3: Where to next?
    


Summary:

Grogu imagines what the Mandalorian's life is like as he deals with not having a ship of his own and then he deal with what his life is like with Luke who doesn't believe that attachments are appropriate for Jedi Padawans.

Chapter Text
Bed time with Master Luke…Location: Camp site“That’s right Grogu. Before I joined the Rebel Alliance I never even left Tatooine. It was the only home I ever knew.” Luke told him as they both settled down to sleep.Grogu liked the small fire that Luke had set up and was sitting next to it for warmth. He’d already learned that Luke was not a snuggler and meditated more than slept anyway. He missed being able to wrap himself up in Din’s cape which doubled as their blanket.He wondered if the Mandalorian missed him at all. How long would it take Din to replace him with another foundling? It wasn’t like Grogu was that hard to find. All Din needed to do was go somewhere with a lot of people who were too distracted to watch their own children and he could have a foundling of his choosing. Although getting away with the kid would be a problem since Din didn’t have his own ship.Grogu could just see him in his mind’s eye. Going to the starport and buying a ticket to somewhere. Like Tatooine. He knew people on Tatooine. People like Peli Motto. He could go there and have her help him find a ship. But first he had to get there.Grogu began to giggle as his closed his eyes and pretended to meditate to make Luke happy. He could see Din trying to get on the ship, but the safety droid would stop him because he always had all those weapons and things. No way could you just walk on any old ship with that stuff.Then Din would have to turn all the stuff over and put it in some sort of secured container because no way was he leaving the stuff behind. Then he’d have to walk on to the ship and pick a seat or go to an assigned seat and just sit there. Without Grogu. Bored. No weapons to clean. He couldn’t polish his armor either. He probably wouldn’t even eat because there would be so many people. That would be awful.But maybe he’d meet a nice family on the ship. A family with children and they wouldn’t know it but the Mandalorian would be smiling at them. He liked kids. Now. Grogu had paved the way for that. Din Djarin had realized that children really were the future, in which case it was important to be good to them. He might be the only Mandalorian that child would ever meet and it would good if they came away from that with a favorable impression. Being feared all the time wasn’t what it was cracked up to be.He hoped the child the Mandalorian met was just nice enough. Not too nice because that was Grogu’s Mandalorian. But not a naughty child either. Din would feel awkward in dealing with any child that tried to color on his armor or pretend that the bounty hunter was actually a droid or anything like that.Those were the thoughts that were drifting through his head when he fell asleep next to the campfire, warm and tired from a long day focused on becoming a great Jedi warrior. Morning Reflection and exercise with Master Luke…Location: EverywhereGrogu was still tired when he heard Luke’s cheerful ‘Wake up, Padawan!’. Padawan? Uff. Grogu had not be a fan of being called a padawan. Many people thought it was his name, because Grogu didn’t seem like a name to them. Well Anakin hadn’t seemed like a name to him either.He and Luke would be finishing the fish from dinner and maybe having part of a ration pack and then they’d be off for their morning exercise. Yippee. Nope. Not yippee.Grogu didn’t mind exercise. He knew that as a future Mandalorian-Jedi warrior he would need to be in top physical condition. He just didn’t like doing that quite so early in the morning. The sun wasn’t even up yet. Ossus was beautiful but it only had the one sun and that was kind of boring. Not like Tatooine.Tatooine was great. It was hot. It was sandy. And Grogu had friends there. Peli. The Pit Droids. The Tuskens. Marshal Vanth. Taanti, the Weequay cantina guy. Lots of people. He missed them all. But mostly he missed the Mandalorian. Still.Luke had said that as his training progressed he wouldn’t need to have attachments to feel like he was connected. He would have the Force. Grogu had covered his laugh up by pretending it was a cough from campfire smoke. The best thing about the Force is that it allowed you to be connected to other people. That was attachment if ever there was any. He wasn’t sure why Luke didn’t realize that.When Grogu thought about being connected to the Force he always thought about the Mandalorian. They were almost the same to him. He wondered if the Mandalorian thought about him the same way. Was Din Djarin more of a Mandalorian because Grogu was his foundling? If he was, what did Mandalorians do for their foundlings other than protect them? Or maybe through protecting them they did everything for a foundling? Grogu had felt protected and cared for with the Mandalorian. Now that he wasn’t with him, how was Din going to protect him?They had just rounded the bend on the trail and Grogu was sweating when it occurred to him that running in armor must be a pain. The Mandalorian never complained about it. He just ran if he had to. Grogu wondered what his armor would be like when he finally got some. He hoped it would be more like a shirt and less like his dad’s armor. The shiny stuff looked great on the Mandalorian, but he was worried that on him it would look silly. He had enough trouble with that. Plus, as a Mandalorian who was also a Jedi, he still thought he should honor his Jedi heritage. Did they even make armor shirts? Grogu had no idea and he wasn’t going to ask Luke because they were just about to start the jumping part of the run and Grogu didn’t like asking questions then.









Chapter 4: Meditation Time with Luke
    


Summary:

Luke instructs Grogu to meditate and Grogu listens to his master, from a certain perspective. He is still worried about Din Djarin and who can blame him. The Mandalorian finds a different way to get into trouble.

Chapter Text
Mid-Morning Meditation with Master Luke…Location: Meadow“Grogu, when we meditate we empty our minds of all concerns. We relax. We lose the self and focus on existing. Really just breathing. The plain routine of our breath. But do not analyze it. Just breathe. Slowly. In and out. In and out…”Master Luke loved to meditate. Sometimes when he was meditating he began to float or he would cause other things to float. So really, he wasn’t thinking of nothing. He was just existing within the Force and that existence ebbed out of him and affected things all around him. It seemed really important to him.When Grogu meditated and he focused on his breathing he would relax and let him mind empty, but as soon as that happened, he would hear his friends. Usually it was his dad, but sometimes it was Peli. Once he’d ever heard Greef Karga!This morning, trying to relax after all his sweatiness earlier, he suddenly heard Peli crying out! But he’d learned to let her have her say. She was excitable and cried out at almost anything. A pit droid dropped a part, she was in pain. A customer couldn’t pay their full bill, she sounded like she was being tortured. A merchant charged her the wrong amount for something and you would think that she had been the one who got stomped on by a mudhorn.So he just listened to what she had to say.‘No! No, BD! Treadwell, get in there and move that engine block so I can blast it!’‘No? You can’t say no. You’re a droid. What is this, a democracy all of a sudden? R5?’‘Fine, I’ll take care of it.’Grogu wondered, kind of dreamily, what Peli had to take care of and who was BD? He thought he knew all of her droids and mechs. Was this a new mech? He’d have to hear more…‘Come out, come out, wherever you are. Stupid womp rat!’‘Oh, its got me! Its chewing! No! God! No!’Oh no! Peli was being attacked by a womp rat! And she wasn’t talking about him! What could he do? He was so far away! If you couldn’t heal a person from far away, what could you do?Grogu wondered if he should interrupt Luke, but when he opened one eye and peeked at the Jedi who seemed both serene and oblivious, Grogu sighed. Nope. He couldn’t interrupt his teacher. He’d have to wait until later. But maybe things would be okay for Peli.Of course for them to be okay the Mandalorian would need to show up and save the day. But then wasn’t that what the Force was supposed to be good at doing? Helping people be where they were needed. He wondered… He focused on his breathing and tried to hear Peli again.‘Hey, look everyone. It’s Mando!’Yippee! Grogu knew the Mandalorian would never let anything bad happen to Peli. It was almost too good for Grogu to stay focused and relaxed. But if he didn’t he would lose the connection and he didn’t want that to happen. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly.‘What do we owe the pleasure? You here to slay another dragon? Chasing down some elusive bounty?’Ha! Grogu knew it! Din must have gone back to bounty hunting. Peli kept on top of stuff like that. She always had the freshest, hottest gossip. It was like caf to her.‘I got your message.’Wow, the Mandalorian was certainly himself. Straight to the point and not using all the words.‘Message? What message?’‘You said you found me a replacement for the Razor Crest.’What?! A new Razor Crest! That was great! Grogu couldn’t wait. He loved that ship. It was just the right size for him and the Mandalorian. And he traveled light and didn’t take up a lot of room. Din could bring all the cold people he wanted.That was just too great. Grogu had to double down on his slow and easy breathing. In and out. In and out. Release the tension. Relax. Let your mind go… back to Peli and Din. ‘Right this way. Wait till you get your eyes on this baby. So, where is your unlikely companion?’Awe. Peli was asking about him. That was so nice of her.‘I returned him to his own kind.’Wow. Din sounded really sad. Like too sad. Sad that his son was so very far away at Jedi Sleep Away Camp. Sigh. Grogu knew that Din only wanted the best for him. But he could have told the Mandalorian that he already knew how to camp.“Grogu… good, you’ve gotten better at focusing and relaxing while meditating. I’m glad you didn’t just go frog hunting. Let’s take a little bit of time and talk about how we all work to keep in balance within the Force…” Luke interrupted him.Grogu opened his eyes and tried to smile. He was glad that Peli was safe and his dad was with her. His two favorite people in the same place. What could be better? Not much really. Well, it would be better if Luke hadn’t mentioned the frogs. Grogu was hungry now from all of that calm mediation and he really wanted some frogs.









Chapter 5: The Balance of Attachments...
    


Summary:

Grogu and Luke discuss balance within the Force and attachments. These are important considerations for the Jedi... but are they all they are cracked up to be? Grogu has opinions about that. Will he share them with Master Luke?

Chapter Text
Lunch Time discussion of balance within the Force with Master Luke…Location: Path to the Lake“I know this is not the most inspiring conversation Grogu, but balance within the Force is very important. It was helps you use the Force without falling to the dark side.”Luke was back to full lecture mode and all Grogu wanted to do was eat some lunch. He’d heard this lecture about balance from so many Jedi, Knights, Masters, Yoda himself… and if Grogu was being totally honest, he had no idea what they were talking about. How was an energy balanced? Wouldn’t equitable have been a better word? If you take too much energy that means there isn’t enough for other people? Or maybe it meant like walking on a slippery log and you had all this potential energy for falling off but it turned into kinetic energy as soon as you tipped too far to one side or the other? Grogu had learned how that worked the hard way.He was glad that he didn’t have all that armor that Din Djarin wore. Because if he did, the fall into the puddle could have had dire consequences. Oh sure, he could swim and he could use the Force to help him out, but either way he’d still be wet in armor. That wouldn’t feel good. He wondered how the Mandalorian managed his balance with that. The Creed or the Way or the Tribe required that he wear the helmet all the time and it was just good sense to wear the armor if your religion involved so many weapons… but how did you balance that against the practicalities of brushing your teeth or shaving your face?Maybe Luke would know. He coo’d at the Jedi.“What? Grogu, I’m not sure I understood your question…”Grogu coo’d again, a little slower and a little louder.“How does a Mandalorian balance between their Creed and their bodily needs? I don’t think I can answer that. I’m not a Mandalorian. Balance can take many forms. How do you balance the need to eat with your need to ask questions?” Luke pushed back.Grogu thought about that. He noticed a frog hopping near the edge of the lake and reached out with the Force and picked it up and brought it to himself and popped it into his mouth. Then he smiled at the Jedi who seemed surprised by his actions.“I see. You prioritize. That is what we all do. To remain in balance within the living Force we must understand our priorities. It is a good time to have some lunch. Then we can move on in our discussions of why attachment is and can be such a problem for a Jedi. Your masters must have talked to you about that as well.” Luke commented, pulling out a small folded parcel that held his rations. For some reason Grogu couldn’t fathom, Luke seemed to like them.But it did give Grogu a few minutes of quiet time to think about the Mandalorian and Peli. He relaxed and let his mind seek them out again.‘Where’s the Razor Crest?’ Din seemed confused. Grogu wondered what he was actually looking at.‘I never said I had a Razor Crest. I said I had a replacement for a Razor Crest.’A replacement? That wasn’t another Razor Crest? Or technically an ST-70 Gunship?‘I don’t have time for this.’The Mandalorian was clearly disappointed.‘Hang on a second. Do you have any idea what this is? This is an N-1 straighter, handmade for the royal guard and commissioned personally by the Queen of Naboo.’Wow! Handmade! For a Queen! How could Din Djarin not like that? It was a starfighter. It probably went really fast too.‘This is a pile of junk.’Oh, no! A pile of junk?! That couldn’t be good.“Grogu, what are you thinking about right now?” Luke asked. He sounded kind of amused.Grogu opened his eyes and sighed. He’d lifted up all sorts of things using the Force. A literal pile of junk.Grogu coo’d a soft ‘sorry’ and waited politely for Luke to finish his food. Most of the rations had been floating in front of Luke’s face. No way was Grogu going to tell him what he’d been thinking of.Early afternoon discussion of attachments with Master Luke…Location: Path to the Meadow“Grogu, I know you still miss the Mandalorian. That is to be expected. He was very important to keeping you safe and helping you find your own kind. He did what he was asked to do by his leader. How you feel about him is what the Jedi call an attachment. You must remember that from your time at the Jedi Temple?” Luke both lectured and asked him a question.Grogu whistled softly. Yes, he remembered those lectures. He’d had plenty of time to reflect upon them. It was his considered opinion that attachments were not as bad as the Jedi let on. The big problem was hiding attachments.For example, everyone at the Temple knew the Librarian was attached to pinching Grogu’s cheeks. She thought he was just the cutest being she had ever met. Grogu was not fond of having that happen, but he understood it. He really didn’t think the Force cared. She hadn’t fallen to the Darkside because she did that. If anything she had protected the younglings when the Temple was attacked even more because they were so special to her.Just like the Mandalorian was special to him. And Peli. And the pit droids. Just like R2-D2 was special to Luke. As much as the Jedi Master tried to pretend that the little blue and white mech wasn’t his best friend, it was clear that R2 was his best friend.If Luke could have R2, why couldn’t Grogu have the Mandalorian? It just seemed that being attached or connected to another living being was a good thing. The Force actually already connected them, right? So why fight it? That didn’t seem balanced.Grogu wondered if Din and Peli had worked out what they were doing about the ship yet. Could they connect on an outcome? He kept his eyes opened as he and Luke traveled from the Lake back to the meadow. He didn’t need to because he was in the back pack, but he still wanted to seem to be paying attention because the Jedi master hadn’t stopped talking.Grogu could just hear Peli trying to talk Din into whatever the pile of junk had been.‘I mean, these are all handmade. No droids. And not only that, what I’m gonna do, just because I like you, is I’m gonna add on some custom modifications that’ll make her faster that a fathier, and because this baby’s pre-Empire, she’s off the grid. And did I mention, she can jump into hyperspace with no docking ring? I mean, come on! You gotta see the potential.’Yup. Peli would see the potential in a bucket full of fasteners. But would Din? Grogu doubted that Peli would leave that to chance.‘Look, at least let me put her together before you decide. Can you give me that? There you go. Hmm? Get this baby up and goin’. You know, it’d be a lot faster if you helped.’Grogu could just see her handing Din some tool to use. The Mandalorian was very handy and good at ship maintenance, excepting the odd problem with blue and red wires. Grogu could imagine him helping. It was a nice thought.“So, you agree that attachments can create problems for a Jedi?” Luke asked.Grogu nodded his head. Yes, attachments created problems for some Jedi. Luke was attached to being right about that subject and Grogu was attached to the truth about it. Some attachments were beneficial and some were not, but it had nothing to do with being a Jedi and everything to do with being a person.









Chapter 6: With a little help from a friend
    


Summary:

Grogu decides to talk to an old friend and see if he can get some help dealing with Luke and the subject of attachment.

Chapter Text
Late afternoon: Meditation time with Master Luke…Location: the MeadowGrogu coo’d at Luke and the young Jedi laughed.“Yes, Grogu, we do need to meditate more than once per day. We just had a long conversation about attachment and how that affects a Jedi. I think its proper for us to meditate and consider what that means in our day to day lives. Perhaps you would be persuaded to stop practicing your Mando’a by doing the daily remembrance for the Mandalorian.”Grogu nodded his head and closed his eyes. Not this again. So her practiced Mando’a. That wasn’t a big deal was it? Shouldn’t a Jedi know the language of the people who had once been one of their biggest enemies? Grogu knew that Mandalorians still existed. He couldn’t just pretend that they didn’t exist.Grogu decided that he should meditate but his meditation goal was pretty specific. He wanted to talk to Master Obi-Wan. He knew the General from the Clone Wars hadn’t cared that much about attachment. There had been a rumor that he had even fallen in love with someone. He was still a great Jedi. Perhaps he had learned something that could help Grogu explain to Luke that attachment didn’t always mean distracted.So Grogu began with slow even breaths. In and out. In and out. He thought about Master Obi-Wan. Like every human Grogu knew, the Jedi Master had been much taller than him. He had a lot of hair and a beard! He always lost his cloak and sometimes his lightsaber.“I did not always lose my cloak and I only lost my lightsaber once or twice. How are you Jedi Grogu?” Master Obi-Wan’s Force Ghost asked him softly.“Attachments?” Grogu thought to the Master who seemed to glow blue, like the sky.“Ah… yes. Attachments. They can be a problem. Is Luke too attached to you?” Obi-Wan asked, taking a ‘seat’ near Grogu.“No. Mandalorian. Me.” Grogu tried to explain in thoughts and words that Luke thought he was too attached to the Mandalorian.“Ah. I see. This Mandalorian rescued you. He protected you. And you healed him when he suffered injuries. It sounds like you two became brothers and friends.”Grogu nodded his head. That was pretty close.“Many Jedi became attached to each other. For many that was beneficial. For some it was a problem. For example, Ahsoka Tano was Anakin’s padawan. She was very attached to him and it hurt a great deal when Anakin fell to the dark side. He was like a brother to me and I felt the same way. But that did not stop either of us from fighting Darth Vader. It is possible to have attachments and still follow the Jedi code. It isn’t easy. Perhaps that is the struggle Luke is having.”Grogu nodded his mental head vigorously.“We kept the information from Luke for a long time that Vader was really Anakin Skywalker and his father. We did not want that to hang over his life as he grew up. I eventually confirmed it for him, but not until I was one with the Force. I had not counted on Vader realizing the connection.”Grogu coo’d at his favorite Jedi Master.“Thank you. It’s true we cannot know everything. Humility is a good trait for a Jedi and all too rare. What else may I help you with, young one?” Obi-Wan asked, looking over at Luke who seemed to be disturbed by a vision.Grogu chirped and clicked at the ghost in a pattern of some considerable length.“Slow down. Yes, from a certain perspective, it would be appropriate for you to keep an ‘eye’ on your former protector. Jedi must understand what is going on in the world and Din Djarin has possession of the Darksaber. Many things are bound to happen to him because of that. It would be beneficial, I think, to have a Jedi, well acquainted with Mandalorian ways, be prepared to intervene if necessary. Excuse me. Luke is hoping that I will discuss a problem with him. I think it will be a long discussion, if you would like to check in on Din Djarin.” Obi-Wan smiled at him and then faded away.Grogu was pretty happy with that conversation.If Master Obi-Wan said it was okay, then it was okay for him to check in on the Mandalorian. And he had the time right then to do that.It was going to take some time for Din and Peli to work on the starfighter. It wasn’t going to take just one day.He thought about them and laughed to himself. Peli and Din working with Jawas and droids and mechs. It was just too funny.‘No, bigger. Uh-Uh, smaller. No. It’s the one with the hole on the end that curves this way. I think I saw it once before over there in that pile near the circulators. There you go. I always knew you were the smart one. Ah! Don’t be jealous. I don’t know why you’re always in such a hurry. “Build me a ship. Fix my blaster holes.” You know, I never went anywhere and look how good I got it. You know, I’ve never even been off world. That’s all right. I’m a local gal. Oh. Let me see that doohickey. Oh, yeah. Oh, that’s good. Good find. What else you got in there?’Peli would just be talking about anything and Din Djarin would let her talk until she paused for a breath and he could get a word in edgewise.‘The entire vapor manifold is missing.’Yup, that’s what they would be doing until the ship was completed.He actually felt relaxed now, knowing that Peli and Din were safe and that at least Obi-Wan understood how he felt about the Mandalorian. That was enough. For now.









Chapter 7: Dinner Time, Vegetables Again?
    


Summary:

Grogu and Luke have dinner after a hard day of meditation and practicing with the Force. They share a meal and discuss Tatooine.

Chapter Text
Dinner Time: Cooking with Master Luke…Location: the Camp fire “So I talked with one of my masters today. Master Kenobi. Do you remember him from the Jedi Temple?” Luke asked Grogu as they sat around the campfire that evening.Grogu sighed a little. Luke always asked him questions like these. He thought that they had established that Grogu knew Obi-Wan and really liked him, but whatever Ahsoka had told the other Jedi, Luke seemed to think he needed to go over stuff like that a lot. Just because Ahsoka didn’t protect her past memories didn’t mean Grogu wouldn’t.“Yes, he said he remembered you. That you were full of mischief and liked to spend your free time in the arboretum. I understand it was quite lovely. I hope one day we will have something beautiful like that here on Ossus.”Grogu smiled and nodded his head. That would be nice. He was pretty good at climbing trees and the flowers that had been planted there were lovely.“He also told me that you were an excellent student. That you had an innate understanding of the Force and how to use it. Ahsoka told me that you don’t like to use it. That you are afraid. I can understand that. It was very strange to me when I first began to use the Force and I worried that I wouldn’t be able to do what I needed to do. I worried about my friends and having them be hurt because of me. That happened more than once Grogu. That is one of the reasons that Jedi are warned about attachments.”Luke fell silent for a few moments. No doubt giving Grogu a chance to comment. Grogu did.He chirped and pointed to the fire.“Oh. You’d like your dinner? Well, we did have another big day and you did do very well with your meditation practice today. I’m glad to see you make that type of progress. So, what would you like for dinner? It would be good for you to eat something other than frogs all the time.”Grogu was just about to ask for frogs, so that was kind of frustrating. He sighed again and thought about what else they could eat. Ossus had a lot of critters. Maybe some yak or more fish. Anything other than rations would be great.Grogu coo’d and chirped. It was Luke’s turn to sigh.“I brought rations with me. If you’d like to go down to the lake we can pick up a fish.”Grogu shrugged. He could eat rations. Sometimes you did something like that to be nice to a person. Grogu had a feeling that Luke needed that extra bit of niceness and amended his comment about never eating another ration pack ever, by saying he’d like the meaty stuff from the ration pack.“That’s good. You should eat more vegetables. They have important nutrients.”Grogu sighed and lifted an eyebrow. Did anyone really know if he needed extra nutrients? He’d didn’t know that and he really didn’t understand how Luke might know that. He never mentioned Master Yoda and what he ate. Grogu was pretty sure that the Jedi Grand Master did not eat vegetables either.“Didn’t the Mandalorian have you eat vegetables?” Luke asked.Grogu shook his head. No. Din did not try to force him to eat things he didn’t want. Mandalorians were the rulers of the picky eaters club and they didn’t try to get people to eat things they didn’t want. It had been great.“Well, we will just see how hungry you are. You can start with the meat portion and then if you want more you can have the vegetable portion. There is a sweet portion as well, but you should try the vegetables before you have the sweet.”Grogu shrugged again. This was not a fight worth fighting. After all, he could always deal with the veggie stuff later when they each went to the privy. Grogu had not lost his ability to hide things in his coverall and that would be one of the things he would do to deal with an excess of vegetable material.The two Jedi sat by the fire and ate their rations. Luke seemed to really enjoy them while Grogu wondered what was wrong with humans. He knew the Mandalorian was always happy to eat a rations pack. But Grogu liked his food fresher than that and with far less processing. Fresh frogs, fresh shrimp, fresh fish, fresh lizard, fresh Krayt Dragon. Yum. Krayt Dragon.Grogu asked Luke if he had ever had Krayt Dragon when he lived on Tatooine.“No, Grogu. I was never unlucky enough to see a Krayt Dragon. Except for one skeleton. They were pretty rare where our farm was. How much of Tatooine did you see while you were there?”Grogu described Peli’s garage and Mos Eisley. He then explained about spending time with the Tuskens and going to Mos Pelgo.“Mos Pelgo? Wow. I haven’t heard that name in a long time. My Uncle Owen had to go there once. He said it was tiny, which on Tatooine meant it probably only had a cantina and a general store. You met the Marshal and he had Mandalorian armor? That is surprising. I haven’t been back there in while.”Grogu chirped and laughed.“Yes, I could go back. I’m not worried about the Hutts or whoever has replaced them since Jabba died. But I have no reason to go there. My family was killed by the Empire and my friends all joined the Rebel Alliance. None of them went back to Tatooine. It’s a lonely planet.”Grogu gave Luke a look. And Ossus wasn’t lonely? There were no cities near them. No towns. No people other than them. Ossus seemed pretty lonely to Grogu.“Well Grogu. This was a good day. One of many that I hope you and I share while you are here. Tomorrow we will start laying out the locations for building the new school. I think you will find that very interesting. There are many who say that Ossus was the home to the very first Jedi Temple. I don’t know if that’s true, but we will have to do a good survey to find our location.”Now that was interesting. What did you look for to site a temple or a school or house you could share with your buir? Those were questions that Grogu wanted the answer to and he hoped that they would find them."

“This isn’t fair!” Padmé laughed breathlessly as Anakin jumped past her and dunked the ball in the hoop. 

“Why’s that?” Anakin asked cheekily.

“You’re too tall! Ani!!” Padmé protested as she tried to jump high enough as he held the ball above his head. Both of them were in stitches.

“The food’s almost ready,” Obi-Wan said stepping out of the house still in his sensible brown apron and slippers.

“Obi-Wan! Help!” Padmé shouted, trying to climb her husband in determination. 

“What?” Anakin gasped. “Don’t involve Obi-Wan in this!” 

“I’m covered in flour!”

“I want to be covered in victory! Obi-Wan!”

“I’m afraid you’ll have to fight the brute yourself!”  

“Obi-Wan can’t help you now!” Anakin said going on his tiptoes, stretching the ball far above them. 

“Use some force, Padmé!” Obi-Wan called. “Tickling is his weakness!” 

“Padmé!” Anakin squawked dropping the ball to protect his exposed sides.

Before Padmé could break away, Anakin caught her by the waist and swung her around.

“I can make you taller!” He declared scooping her up.

“Anakin!” Her face was red from the cold autumn air and her gasping laughter. 

Anakin jogged over to Obi-Wan, Padmé in his arms.

“You said something about dinner?” 

It was a good day.

“This isn’t fair!” Padmé rolled her eyes. She sat on the porch as Anakin and Obi-Wan played one on one. Despite Anakin’s natural advantage, Obi-Wan wasn’t above dirty tricks.

“It’s street rules,” Obi-Wan said primly.

“And what do you know about the street, Professor Kenobi?” Anakin asked while trying to avoid elbows and get at the ball.

“That I’m winning!” Obi-Wan said taking a shot. Anakin smacked the ball back down. 

“I was talking about me sitting out,” Padmé complained. 

“It’s for your own protection, Obi-Wan would not go easy on a pregnant lady,” Anakin said while pushing his sweaty hair out of his face.

“Pregnant women are known to do feats of superhuman strength and Padmé bites, this is for our 

own 

protection,” Obi-Wan corrected. He deftly stole the ball away again while Anakin was distracted. 

Padmé grinned, “Careful now.” 

Obi-Wan got another basket and let the ball roll away going to sit down beside Padmé on the steps. 

“We didn’t mean to bore you, dearheart,” Obi-Wan said sincerely. He took her hand, kissing it tenderly. 

Despite the sweat-soaked shirt she smiled and found it charming, leaning in and kissing him directly on the lips in greeting. 

Anakin grabbed the ball, took a shot, missed, and shrugged going to sit on the other side of his wife, bumping her shoulder affectionately. She pecked him on the lips as well. 

“It’s not really boring,” she sighed after a moment in their company.  “I just miss being able to run around. Everyone in city hall acts like I can’t even carry a cup of water. Someone whispered to me gently the other day as if my ears couldn’t take loud sounds.”

Anakin snorted, “Seriously?”

“True story! It’s ridiculous! I think they worry I’ll go into labor in front of them if they upset me. I almost wish that’s how it worked.” She rubbed her baby bump. “I’m tired and sweaty, and I want to meet him.”

“Him?” Anakin asked. “I thought we weren’t going to ask the doctor.”

Padmé smiled. “I didn’t, I don’t know for sure, just intuition.” 

“The way she kicks I bet she’s going to be a girl,” Anakin said gazing affectionately. “Fierce little Leia. Just like her Mama.”

“Shall we bet on it? Obi-Wan?” Padmé prompted.

“I wouldn’t trust anything that doctor says,” Obi-Wan said, an old argument. “He didn’t even think you were pregnant when you were starting to show.” 

“I know, I know, come on, what’s your guess?” she pushed him playfully. 

Obi-Wan shrugged. “Who knows? Both?” 

“Somehow he’s going to win, you know that, right?” Anakin grumbled, reaching around Padmé to smooth down some of Obi-Wan’s messed-up hair. “Has to win at everything.”

“Don’t be a sore loser, darling,” Obi-Wan said smugly, tilting his head against Anakin’s fingers.

Anakin gripped his hair a little firmer and tugged him for a kiss on the cheek before releasing him. 

“Nonbinary is fine I just want them out,” Padmé pouted while leaning forward to accommodate them. She sighed again and put her forehead on Anakin’s arm. He stroked her long loose hair in comfort.

“You’re sweaty.” she wrinkled her nose in realization leaning away again.  

“Well, for now, the food should be here soon. We’ll have just enough time for a shower,” Obi-Wan said checking his phone. 

“Eating is something I can still do,” she squeezed Obi-Wan’s knee and the two helped her up.

It was a good day.

“No fair!” Leia cried. “Daddy’s too tall!” 

Anakin grinned down at his daughter. “That’s not my fault!” 

“Too tall!” Luke shouted. 

Leia grabbed Luke’s hand and tugged him forward, then tried stepping on her brother to gain some height.

“I don’t think that’s the way to do it, baby,” Padmé said, picking up her daughter before she stepped on her brother’s face.

“Mama, it’s not fair!” Leia repeated in her toddler rage squirming in her arms. 

“You’re right, let’s team up!” Padmé said conspiringly.  

“Yeah!” the twins shrieked in joy.

“He’s ticklish Luke!” Obi-Wan shouted from the porch in his worn old apron. 

 Luke tackled Anakin’s legs as Padmé hefted Leia up on her shoulders. 

Obi-Wan cheered from the porch as Anakin playfully staggered back, letting Luke push him down and losing the ball to Leia’s grasping hands.

Luke instantly started tickling. Anakin laughed in surrender.  

“Obi-Wan has taught you well,” Anakin said as Luke crawled up him for a hug. Anakin grinned hugging his son and kissing his nose. “He taught you his tricks!” 

“We win!” Leia declared holding the ball above her head in triumph. “Mama! We did it!” 

“We win!” Luke echoed happily letting his Daddy scoop him up back to standing. 

Padmé set Leia back on the ground. The little girl ran over to Obi-Wan. 

“Ben look!” she showed off the ball. “We won it!” 

“Very impressive,” Obi-Wan said with all the formality and grandiosity he could. “A hard-won victory young, Skywalker.” 

“I helped!” Luke said excitedly, running over and peering up at Obi-Wan for praise as well.

“Excellent teamwork,” Obi-Wan said graciously. “Keen strategists know when to work together for the greater good.”  

“What am I? A supervillain?” Anakin complained good-naturedly.

“Mama helped,” Leia said as if Obi-Wan hadn’t just watched the whole debacle.  

“As a reward,” Obi-Wan cleared his throat, holding back a grin. “We shall have a feast.”

“Feast! Feast!” the twins cheered.
“I told you he would get them to eat their veggies somehow,” Anakin muttered to Padmé.
 “He hasn’t done it yet, Skywalker,” Padmé said, elbowing him as they followed their children back to the house.
Obi-Wan dipped and Padmé kissed his lips while Anakin took advantage and kissed the top of both of their heads.

It was a good day."

Chapter Text
They were fiery. They were reckless. They were convinced of their own opinions and determined to see those through, regardless of whatever was in the way. They were youths, in short. All three of them: peas in a pod: a naturally occurring triad of three different species with similar names, and they were all proud of it all: Tar, Tre and T’ra. And then it all crashed and burnt in a cascade of horrible, horrible things: Amma went missing, then Té who searched for them alone, then both were gone, then the so-called Ruusan Reformation was put in place by the heavily limping, fearful Republic and equally fearful Jedi High Council, then the Republic carpet-bombed Manda’yaim and so many were lost in it so gruesomely, so suddenly, so senselessly. And here Tre-Fay Viz has been since then: floating in the Outer Rim and Wild Space and beyond on the currents of the universe, helping where she can, mourning whom she cannot help, distant from her surviving kin and people, wearing neither Jedi robes nor Mando’ad armour, numb and nearly as raw as centuries ago when it all happened. But now the currents call her home, call her to her armour and only her armour, and she follows the promptings as she always does. She strips most of the old paints but leaves the symbols be. She is still a Viz and part of the triad and a Soul-of-Stars, after all, and she has earned the honours bestowed on her. But she has forsaken her duties except for the barest concepts of them all these centuries; she can no longer claim valor in her heart, having cowardly avoided nearly all traces of her family all this time; and, given all those, how can she say that she is reliable, let alone honouring her family? She keeps strips of justice black on her helmet, as she has done her best to uphold it wherever she goes. But now she adds new-path light blue to the plates, and mourning grey, and makes both the prevailing theme of her armour. She is still very much mourning what was, after all, but also doing her best to look forward and onward. Who knows, after this mission she might even reconnect with the kin and people she has neglected for so long, including her own surviving triad sibling T’ra.









Chapter 2: All, Painted Over
    




Chapter Text
Children are easy prey to adults in so many ways. They are even easy prey among themselves. Fay knows this well. She, Té and Ra have experienced it once. Té even had to endure a stint as a child slave for a little while, having been betrayed by fellow children of the clan. And then they were betrayed once more, barely into their adulthood, barely into the more peaceful part of their reign as mand’alor, by a clan member bearing part of her name. Fay shakes her head fiercely to that, trying to dislodge it from her thoughts as quickly as possible. She needs to pay attention to her current mission, not dwell on what was. Not right now. Other child slaves need her now. Slaves concealed behind the façade of a very nice if segregating “orphanage for non-human species.” Backed by wealthy, powerful businesspeople and the local government. It is good that she wears her armour and brings along a few sets of undercover outfits for other options, then. She will not accidentaly implicate the current Jedi Order, this way – the toothless, enchained beings that they are now, fully in obeyance of the Republic whose local government has enabled this. It is also good that she has replenished her medical kit and ammunitions, with extras of both. She will need them, she knows. She might even need the firepower and other capabilities of her beloved, trusty Whistling Bird 3, her old starfighter that Alyé has thankfully kept cared for, up-to-date and hidden for her all these centuries, and how thankful she is that she is flying in it now. Jon, Knol, Nico and little Yad’ika have promised to meet up with her on planet for this mission, too. She is not alone. No, she is not alone. And she has the bad feeling that she will need their companionship and support soon.









Chapter 3: Not Only My Paint
    




Chapter Text
The obsequious, unctuous, sycophantic greed hinted in the attitude of the owner of the “orphanage” is… surprising, when faced with a fully armed, fully armoured Mando’ad. But how he sees the paints – and perhaps also the symbols? – and then promises that “the package will be delivered on time this time” is definitely alarming, and Fay itches to get right down to it immediately. She cannot, though; not right now, at any rate. She is just scouting ahead while waiting for her backup, and the backup regretably will take some more time to assemble. After all, they are now not just fellow wanderers and her little one, as Alyé insisted to come along when she fetched Whistling Bird 3, and Ra likewise when she reconnected with the latter through their bond as they regretably rarely do nowadays, and they are all from different corners of the galaxy. And, as part of her scouting, “I want to see the children.” Blunt. To the point. Normal in Mandalorian Space. Rude in Republic Space. But the disgusting, disgustingly fat twi’lek in front of her takes it in stride, in the way that suggests it as usual for him. `Lots of dealings with the rougher side of the Republic? Or with Mando’ad’e?` That last part is the most disgusting of all, if it is true. And, judging by how the children that the twi’lek then gathers for her “inspection” recognise and cower away from her, it is even more likely than not. `A new Demagol? Or several of them?` Her heart plummets to somewhere at the bottom of her guts, it feels. And it slides icily, slimily down to the sole of her feet when one of the oldest children, one foot deformed and face young but eyes so, so old and weary, glares hatefully at the symbol of her triad painted on her beskar’ta when the slaver is looking away. `Who else have been using our symbol, Ra?` she sends to her remaining triad sibling, alongside all the shock-alarm-dismay-disgust she feels. Rueful-guilty-sad is what answers her at first. Then Ra admits, `I haven’t been in touch with Manda’yaim and its surroundings for a long time, Ré. But, tangentially, I know of three loudest factions that have been fighting with each other lately: the so-called Death Watch, True Mandalorians and New Mandalorians.` Ludicrous names, all. Fay tells her sibling just that. She gets a mirthless laugh for the acerbic remark and an admonishing mental nudge, accompanied with, `But true nonetheless. Be careful, Ré.` That parting statement echoes loomingly in her mind. And perhaps it is why she damn flinches when a vocoded voice demands from just outside of the room, “To’leh! Where’s the package?” And when the speaker barges in…. `Oh. Oh! Stars, how could it be?`









Chapter 4: The “Right” Paint
    




Chapter Text
The verd that comes in is also garbed in new-path light blue and mourning grey, and they also have her triad symbol painted on their strangely not-well-made shell, if on the shoulderplates instead of the ironheart, although they bear no sigil of Clan Viz anywhere on at least the front of their armour. And they are just as taken aback when they see Fay already standing in front of the “merchandise.” But in a confused way, rather than a shocked way like Fay is feeling, which would actually be the sane response given that that symbol is personalised only to her triad! “Who are you?” she signs discreetly with one hand, even as the other hand rests lightly on her blaster. But the other just repeats the same sign and mimics the same posture, their confusion even more palpable, now also tinged with rising suspicion. So she urges Toleh the disguised slaver to finish whatever he needs to do elsewhere, and the other verd actually agrees with her. But they figuratively jump in before she can ask anything of them once both are alone but for the staring children, signing quickly and forcefully with one hand even as the other keeps resting on their own blaster, demanding what’s she doing here, who sent her, and, somehow, who’s her squad leader. She frowns behind her faceplate. `Since when do we have organised military after the Annihilation, Ra?` she sends to her sibling, even as her hand signs back to the appropriator of her paints and symbols, demanding what are they doing here, who sent them here, and why are they in her paints and symbols. Their startled – and startlingly derisive – laugh is quite startling and unwelcome. Also the blasterbolt they sends her way. It is thankfully a killbolt, so she can return it to them via strategic deflection using her vambrace. But it unfortunately also causes the children to scream and cower, and more verd’e who are painted just like this first one stampeed in, like untrained younglings that are bothersome and could cause harm with their very carelessness. With that in mind, she stuns all of them, stacks them on one corner of the room, sweeps for more through the Force and by networking into the surveillance system, and informs her sibling about this new situation. Well, the good news is that there’s no other verd’e painted like her around. But the bad news is that she has to deal with a now-suspicious Toleh while her backup aren’t here yet. And the worse news is that one of the surveillance cameras is catching a hint of a verd painted not like her approaching this place from the back. Now she wishes she were back trying to aid the sick and the poor back in the Outer Rim – or better yet, the Wild Space.









Chapter 5: The “Wrong” Paint
    




Chapter Text
It is aggravating to be shot at before words are exchanged in any way, shape or form, and Fay is receiving this treatment twice in just as many hours. All from fellow verd’e, no less, although this one is thankfully painted differently from her: in yellow, purple, red, orange and some blue… and is that the Mythosaur skull on their shoulderplates? The shooter accuses her of belonging to a faction called Death Watch, too! “It is a stupid and pretentious name, just like the other two,” she grumbles, even as she wrestles the lithe being – a fellow scout, no doubt – for possession of their blaster, with discreet boost to her long-untrained muscles from her connection to the universe. The statement enrages the other verd. But it makes them sloppy, too, and it is what Fay has aimed for, indeed. In a rather short time, they are tied securely and positioned facing the pile of unconscious probable “Death Watch” verd’e. Now she turns round, facing the children, although part of her attention never leaves the other verd’e in the room, the surveillance cameras, and her own Force-based monitoring system round the area. She soothes them, then questions them about other children that might still be squirreled away by Toleh, where are the exits and entrances they know, who and what usually guard them, if any of them needs medical help right now or help in moving, and if there is anything they would like to bring with them, as gently as she can but pushy nonetheless. Because they must go now, given how quickly the situation has progressed downward. Even Ra agrees, albeit ruefully and with much concern. `Can you deal with the children, the slavers and those odd verd’e? All at once?` she tags on, and Fay sends her a mental shrug in response. Well, Fay truly doesn’t know, but she will do her best nonetheless, and sometimes it’s the only thing anyone can do, isn’t it? Just, “Where are you bringing the children to?!” the latest verd squawks as they struggle harder out of their secure bonds, panicked, and Fay sends them a frown verging on a scowl. “Who wants to know?” she demands back. 
“They took my child and my child isn’t here!”
 The sudden hysteria takes Fay aback, almost literally given the burst of emotions that also explodes in the Force. `Oh. This changes things.`

Notes:
Folks, thanks muchly for your enthusiasm for this little story! I was worried, at first, I admit. So few people seemed to be interested in this. (I have been quite spoiled by you folks sharing your impressions of the chapters with me! LOL) But now I am no longer so anxious of if I did something wrong. Thank you!Although, I've got to admit, this is the last available chapter, for now... Hopefully I'll be able to finish the next installment tomorrow. Who knows, it might not be the last...And I'll reply to your comments after that -- sorry! I read and squeed over each and every one of them, though!ReyPS: There is a reference to a few extremely long-lived individuals in this chapter, in a blink-and-miss way. I hope you are all right with it.




Chapter Text
When her backup arrive, the children – all the children – have been bundled away, still on-planet but elsewhere. Toleh and his cohorts have been exposed to the public, as well, mostly by the colourfully painted verd who grudgingly introduced themself as “Lyra Rook, True Mandalorian.” Fay leaves the others – well, most of the others – to deal with the unrests and governmental changes. Because she and Ra are too busy caring for the children and answering Lyra’s questions. Which pertain  mostly to their paints, and the symbol of their triad, and why Fay has chosen to use such combination of paints, and where have they been for centuries, and who is – or was – the third of their triad. And the questions burst anew when the siblings, now feeling annoyed and tired and mourning anew for their third indeed, reveal about Té, whom people nowadays apparently know as “Tarre Vizsla.” And some know them very well indeed, according to Lyra – their name, at least, and the fact that they were “Mandalorian Jedi.” And the symbol of their triad? It has been appropriated as the symbol of Death Watch, which is purportedly a terrorist group. It is actually just slightly worse than appropriating the very old, very respected, long-disused symbol of the mythosaur hunters that this group – the so-called True Mandalorians – uses. Just slightly. Both are bad, especially given how the trio of siblings have heard the tails of those who defended the early settlements from the rampages of the mythosaurs first-hand, namely from their own parent and eldest sibling plus the sibling’s spouse. Complaining at the one who never had a say in deciding the symbols is not fair, however, and fairness is very important to the trio, especially after Té became mand’alor. So Ra is silent about the matter after receiving her answers, and Fay follows suit. It is an awkward silence, because Lyra suspects that there is something wrong in what they said, judging by their change of questions, but the siblings persist. They – or rather, Fay – only answer when the question pertains to what the “Death Watch symbol and colouring” means to them. “It is our symbol: Tar, T’ra and I,” Fay asserts. “As for the colouring, I chose them, long before I knew about Death Watch, because I felt that the old ones no longer represented me. Is it not how verd’e paint their armour nowadays?” Lyra snorts, even as they check on the row of sleeping children that includes their own Limara. “We do, but Death Watch verd’e don’t. Vizsla – Tor Vizsla – is trying to recreate the old empire, through what the last crusade did, down to the uniform paints.” “But the paints used by the verd’e in the last crusade were all monochromes, either solid gold or solid silver,” Fay returns slowly, confused. “They never preyed on their own people, too. It would be counterproductive for the creation of a solid empire, would it not?” Lyra chuckles, and it’s a dark, flat, mirthless thing. Fay shivers. Ra’s leaves rustle. `They were hurt personally by Death Watch,` Fay surmises in the shared mental space the triad created long ago. `How their child ended up here, maybe, even.` `So we ought to be ‘jedi’ in our response and not return their invasive questions,` Ra joins in, wryly and a little sourly, and it’s all Fay can do to stifle her laughter, even though the statement and this stiuation overall are not that funny. The awkward silence returns, then, this time unbroken except when Ra leaves to coordinate with the other backup, and Fay leaves to source out for supplies and transportation for the children. There is nothing more to say, after all."

Chapter Text
Count Dooku had never liked to be kept to rules he didn’t agree with it. It was the reason he made a pretty bad Jedi even as he grew up in a temple that admired him for his intelligence, swordsmanship and beauty. For most of his youth he was told he would be destined to be chosen as a Courtesan and finally be allowed to leave the temple with a Sith master. He never was. He was born in the wrong era – one of turmoil between the Siths and as the dust settled only two were left neither likely or interested in gaining a Courtesan. Then the older one died as well.As Dooku grew older, his hair starting to grey but his swordsmanship sharper than ever he grew tired of his entrapment. Jedi weren’t allowed to leave the temple as anything else than a Courtesan; Dooku was told it was because they were too innocent, too weak to survive in the cruelness of the galaxy surrounding them. But even growing up isolated and surrounded by Jedi Keeper’s Dooku was too clever and sharps-sighted to truly believe it. What a coincidence that the only people truly able to be a threat to the Sith were put away, raised as their willing prostitutes and with such a fear of the outside world that they wouldn’t dare to leave. How curious!At first Dooku tried to tell his brothers and sisters of his realization. Surely he couldn’t be the only one to realize what was being done to them. Wolves domesticated into lap dogs!No one listened. At best he was given a condescending smile – “He’ll understand when he becomes older” – at worst he was laughed it.Dooku grew disillusioned.So he left.   The temple’s teachings were right: The galaxy was a cruel place and the first month Dooku spend outside of the temple he was betrayed, mugged, hunted and nearly killed.The temple’s teachings also couldn’t have been more wrong: Dooku thrived. Finally – FINALLY! – something that required his full attention, his full use of his intellect and abilities. And he had an aim: He would march to the surviving Sith lord and he would fight for his brothers and sisters freedom. He would prove them all wrong.   
Several decades later Count Dooku was sitting in his palace on Serenno running through report after report. As a young Jedi the life of a Sith had seemed perfect: They had made a galaxy without any competition for themselves, ruling over the peasants with all the freedom you could imagine. Unfortunately reigning entire solar systems had sounded far more glorious than it actually was. There were people to protect, rebellions to snuff out, trade treaties to make and hungry mouths to be fed. Not speaking of the inane disputes people persisted to bring to him.

“Remind me.” He mumbled nearly to himself. “Why I should care about this petty argument who the true heir of some small piece of farm land in the eastern squadron is?”

“Tread carefully.” Qui-Gon sat opposite him hiding a sly smile under his beard. “They make your favorite tea in that squadron if you displease them you might be cut off.”

Dooku threw him an annoyed glare. “The disputes with the trading confederation are getting more heated by the minute don’t you have better things to do than to annoy me?”

“I thought annoying you was part of the job description of a Courtesan, old man.” Qui-Gon had been an unconventional Jedi and he was just as much of an unconventional Courtesan. Or to say it in other words: He was a pain in Count Dooku’s noble behind.

“I should have you thrown to the fishes for your insolence.” Dooku grumbled.

“I do apologize for my insolence, oh Count. Please forgive me.” Qui-Gon said in an unmoved tone then he took another data pat to peer into. “You shouldn’t complain anyway, you have chosen this after all.”
   Count Dooku had expected a lot of things as he stormed into the high Chancellors door with his light saber drawn but not activated demanding the freedom of the Jedi. He hadn’t expected him to smile.“Imprisoned?” Palpatine had repeated Dooku’s words back to him. “Such a terrible world for the protection I am providing.”“Protection?” Dooku has scoffed. “You don’t let any of us leave the temple.”“Don’t I?” The Sith lord’s smile had something fatherly. “I tell them not to, yes, as did my master before me and his master before him but you clearly left the temple. Did I put up insurmountable barriers? Unbeatable guardians that kept you from leaving? Did I even put up a gate surrounding the temple.”“I…” Dooku frowned. “I mean…”“Aren’t you all trained in the ways of the light saber?” Palpatine’s tone was so soft. “Capable warriors in your own right?”“Yes but…”“Then why haven’t they left?”“Because you continue to tell them how dangerous it is outside!” Dooku felt anger bubble up inside him and as he gestured with an arm a sudden gust of wind threw the vase from the Chancellor’s table which shattered into a million pieces on the ground.“No!” Palpatine’s eyes hardened. “They don’t leave because they’re Jedi. They are weak. They follow rules without thought – without even an idea of a rebellion!”“I left!” Dooku proclaimed proudly.“You did.” Palpatine smiled again but this time he was showing teeth. “Because you aren’t like them. You aren’t a Jedi.” He put a hand to his belt and drew his own light saber in all its scarlet glory. “Do you want me to tell you how true power feels like?”   
“I haven’t heard anything back from Obi-Wan in awhile.”

“Mhm?” Dooku looked up from the contract in front of him with a frown. “Pardon, did you say something beloved?”

Qui-Gon tsked and gave him a fond eye-roll. “I swear to god if I wouldn’t more or less force-feed you and carry you off to bed you would die buried under a pile of documents.”

“I’m more than capable to take care of myself.”

“Mhm, sure.” Someone nearly twenty years his junior shouldn’t be able to give him such a condescending smile.

Dooku decided to ignore him. “Did you have something to say or are you just trying to keep me from working?”

Qui-Gon’s smile faded from his face again. “I haven’t heard anything from Obi-Wan for the last few weeks.”

“Oh.” Dooku barely knew his Courtesan’s former student but he knew he was important to Qui-Gon. “Wasn’t he sick or something?”

Qui-Gon’s frown deepened. “For weeks on end? If it is so bad they should transport him to a better healer since the temple clearly cannot provide one that helps.”

Dooku sighed. “I promise I’ll look into it once I inverted this crisis.”
   Being a Sith came far more natural to Dooku; condensing all his frustration and anger into his use of the force felt like he could breathe again. No more inane rules without explanation. Finally people gave him the respect his stature deserved. Everything was going well.Until Palpatine’s second student Darth Maul attacked his master seemingly out of nowhere, leaving him disfigured and spitting mad.Dooku knelt next to Palpatine as he was walking up and down the hall. “He will suffer for his betrayal! Him and his dirty Zabrak brother!”“Yes master!” Dooku was used to his master’s temper even if he didn’t share it. Better to agree and wait until he calmed again.It seemed to work somewhat, Palpatine’s grimace relaxed into something that would have probably seemed neutral if it weren’t for the new disfigurement of his face. “I guess I should have seen it coming. He has been trying to surpass my power for awhile now. I should have put an end to it earlier. Yes, I’ll have to take control of this situation as fast as possible.”“Yes master.”Palpatine’s yellow eyes turned to Dooku as if it was the first time he really saw him. “Have you ever heard of the Rule of two?”Dooku raised an eyebrow. “I can’t say I have.”“It was an idea of the old Sith.” Palpatine explained. “A way to reduce or maybe even stop conflict among our own kind.”“I thought conflict was what made us powerful.”“Conflict is what killed my former master.” Palpatine answered. “It left us nearly extinct.”“I admit a Sith’ passion can lead to undue violence.” Dooku concurred. “So what was the proposed solution?”“The Rule of two stipulates that there are always supposed to be only two Sith at the same time.” Palpatine explained. “A master and a student. Following this doctrine conflict can only arise if given the chance to.”Dooku frowned. This doctrine sounded a lot like the things he had been taught in the temple but he had the feeling it would go far less well for him if he questioned it aloud this time. “That certainly would reduce conflict but wouldn’t it also impede our growth?”“Sith do not need other people to grow. We aren’t JEDI!” His master jeered. “I will enforce this new Rule and will go down in history as the greatest force-wielder to ever have lived. And you will be right at my side sharing our glory.”“Master, do you want me to kill Maul and his brother?” Dooku could get behind that idea he had never liked Maul much in the first place.“No,” Palpatine whispered. “I have a more important task for you while I take care of my old student.” The force itself seemed to freeze in terror had his next words. “I want you to go to the Jedi temple and kill them all.”   Finding Darth Maul and his brother to ally against Palpatine hadn’t been as hard as Dooku might have suspected. Maybe it shouldn’t have surprised him that Maul’s sudden turn against their former master months ago had actually come after being ordered to kill his own flesh and blood. Somehow it still did. Palpatine really dug his own grave.Killing Darth Sidious seemed out of Maul’s and his own power but with combined forces they managed to banish him into the far corners of the Outer Rim. To avoid any more conflict from forming they divided the known galaxy in two and each chose a territory to rule. Luckily Maul hadn’t been interested in Coruscant leaving the planet and the Jedi temple for Dooku to reign. One thing he had learned during all of this: The Jedi needed to be protected at all costs because clearly they were incapable to do it themselves. Had Dooku agreed to Palpatine’s plan the Jedi would have gone extinct!









Chapter 2: Qui-Gon's decision
    




Chapter Text
A natural inclination to leading had always been one of the talents that made Count Dooku a rather bad Jedi. He had believed it would make him the ideal choice for taking over the Empire from his former master. Life was rarely so easy.Emperor Palpatine had shown interest in the different worlds of his territory only in so far that they didn’t rebel. Even enquiring for information about the greatest crisis that demanded his attention had nearly buried Dooku under a mountain of paperwork starting with trading disputes going up to natural disasters and wars.While most of Palpatine’s people couldn’t exactly have been described as loyal to Palpatine that unfortunately only was because they were not loyal to anyone. Dooku felt himself forced to fire or rid otherwise of most of them leaving him with even more work. Several people offered their aid to him but he felt himself unable to trust them as well. He had already been disappointed by the Jedi, his master and most of what he saw of the galaxy.Still maybe he should at least think about investing in a personal assistant - or at least a secretary he didn’t want to murder the moment she opened her mouth.“Count, the delegation of Stewjon asks when you could organize a meeting with them.”“I already told them,” Dooku snapped. “That I can’t make time before next month at the earliest.”“But the famine…”“…would be far less severe if people left me the time to organize food deliveries!” Dooku stormed past him into his – Palpatine’s former - office. He slammed the door shut and let himself fall into the chair behind the giant desk with a sigh.“Bad day?”The red light-saber was drawn and at the strangers throat before Dooku had even registered his presence properly. The intruder was a man with a long hair and beard dressed in Jedi robes. He had sat down in one of the visitor chairs and was looking down at the saber with a crooked smile – his hands raised half-heartedly in surrender.“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”“Who are you?” Dooku asked in dangerously low tone. “And what are you doing in my office?”“My name is Qui-Gon Jin,” answered the Jedi calmly. “And I came to talk to you.”Dooku started to realize he wasn’t in any immediate danger so he pulled his saber back and put it back on his belt. “I have nothing to tell you, Jedi. Return to your temple at once!”“No.” Qui-Gon didn’t raise his voice but his tone made it clear he was determined.Count Dooku strode back to his desk, turned around and glared down at the Jedi. “You will do as told, Jedi! Or I’ll have you removed!”“Will you?” The Jedi slowly stood up his right hand on the light saber on his belt. “I would be interested to see who you have employed who can hold themselves against a Jedi. If they fail you’ll have to engage me after all I guess.”“I do not have time for this nonsense!” Dooku huffed. “What do you want?”Qui-Gon gave him a bright smile and sat back down in his chair legs crossed and chin resting on his hand. “I would have talked to your second-in-command.” He said ignoring Dooku’s question. “Or even a competent secretary but you seem to be lacking both. Tell me, have you ever considered leading an entire empire on your own might be a bad idea?”Dooku refused to let Qui-Gon lead the conversation so easily. He walked around the table and sat down in his chair as well, hands folded primly on the desk. “Competent people are hard to find these days.”“Especially if you aren’t searching.” Qui-Gon raised in eyebrow. “You have been in power for about a year now and still you have never visited the temple looking for a Courtesan. If you’re looking for competence why not start at the pool of people raised for that very ability.”“I’m not interested in a lap dog.” Dooku replied coldly.“Ah.” Qui-Gon’s smile vanished.“Is that why you are here? To ask to be appointed Courtesan?” Dooku scoffed. “How disappointing!”“I am here…” Qui-Gon’s voice had become dangerously quiet. “…because the food supply to the Jedi temple has become diminished enough we have problems feeding the younglings.”“The dispute with the trading federation has become drawn-out since Darth Sidious has decided to take part in it.”“Then do something about it.”Dooku rolled his eyes. “Clearly you have no idea about how a conflict like this needs to be handled, stuck in your ivory tower as you are.”“MY PADWAN IS STARVING!” Qui-Gon stood up again – a controlled movement that still put the hairs on Dooku’s neck on end. “I came here to put an end to this and I will not go before my people are properly fed again!”Dooku laughed without humor. “Fine, if you think a single Jedi who never left the temple is going to make so much of a difference, go ahead!” He took a data pad from his desks and held it out for Qui-Gon. “This holds most of the details of the trading federation-dispute have fun finding the miracle medicine that will heal this conflict in seconds.”Qui-Gon carefully took the data pad and looked down at it with a frown. Then he looked at Dooku again. “I demand the authority to make some decisions without your input otherwise I won’t be able to help.”“Alright,” Dooku waved his hand. “You are now formerly appointed as my Courtesan. I will inform the necessary parties as soon as possible. Now please leave!”Qui-Gon raised an eyebrow and some of the good humor returned to his eyes. With an exaggerated bow he took his leave. “As you wish, Count.”Dooku had the feeling he’d regret this decision soon.  
“It has been months!” It was unusual for Qui-Gon to be agitated enough for pacing but he seemed to have reached the level. “Months and still no word of Obi-Wan!”

“He is a teenager.” Dooku pointed out. “Maybe he is in a rebellious phase?”

“That is unlike Obi-Wan.” Qui-Gon sighed and ran his hands over his face, rubbing his eyes. “But maybe…” All the energy seemed to leave him and he let himself fall into a chair next to where Dooku was sitting. “Maybe he feels abandoned by me? I did leave him without even waiting for him to be a Knight.”

“You stopped him and several WORLDS from starvation.” Dooku pointed out taking Qui-Gon’s hand in his. “I wouldn’t call that abandonment.”

“Isn’t it?” Qui-Gon sighed and dropped his head on Dooku’s shoulder. “I still have left him, I doubt to a teenager’s fragile self-esteem the reason why makes much of a difference.”

Not much to argue about there. Dooku sighed. “Once we next go to Coruscant we will visit the temple the moment we touch down.”

“The Mandalorian War…”

“…will be there the next day as well.”

Qui-Gon looked up at him with an unusually somber look. “Thank you.”

“Don’t worry.” Dooku smiled back. “We have to make sure my step-padawan is alright after all.”
  “JEDI!”“My name is still Qui-Gon.” The man smiled cheekily from the place on DOOKU’S desk. “You should remember that by now, I’m your Courtesan after all.”Dooku didn’t have patience for this at the moment. He slammed down a data pad in front of Qui-Gon on the table and hissed: “Since when are we allied with Naboo and why did no-one think about informing me?”Qui-Gon leaned back with a smile. “We have been allied for three weeks now. I did not inform you since you seemed more than busy with the Tatooine-situation.”“What you promised them is unsustainable!” Dooku shouted. “We cannot personally protect every system from the trading confederation we do not have the fleet!”“We do now.” Qui-Gon answered. “I have made a treaty with the Clone soldiers of Kamino.”“The Kaminoans can’t be trusted!” Dooku protested. “They were hired by Palpatine to make those Clones.”“Which is why I did not make a treaty with Kamino.” Qui-Gon answered. “I did the treaty with the leader of the Clone rebellion searching for a new planet to settle down on. Unfortunately for a lot of people but lucky for us one of Darth Sidious schemes left an entire planet basically uninhabited so I promised it to the Clones in exchange for their services.”Dooku starred at him in wonder. “A…and how will we feed them?” He protested weakly.“With the rations Naboo promised us in exchange for our help.” Qui-Gon smiled. “They produce ten times the needed nourishment for the entire planet, did you know that?”Dooku felt his knees become weak and he sat down in the very visitor chair he had met Qui-Gon in only a little over a month ago. “How did you do all of that? I… I have been trying for weeks…”“I wouldn’t feel too bad about it.” Qui-Gon stood up from the chair and shrugged. “Most people shy away from trusting a Sith - especially Darth Sidious’ former student - but a Jedi…” He walked away from the desk in the direction of the door. “We are trusted without question. And it’s not like you did nothing in that time after all. As far as I counted you deescalated two wars, made four trade deals and even slept one whole night in the last week.” He patted Dooku on the back as he walked past him to the door, opened it and then turned around one last time. “Also, did you really believe, I have never left the Jedi temple in my entire life? By the force that sounds quite dull. All the friends and allies I would have missed out on.” And he closed the door behind himself.  
“Count Dooku?” The much more competent secretary Qui-Gon had hired put her head through the gap between door and wall. 

“Yes?” Dooku looked up from his paperwork that had severely reduced since Qui-Gon had become his Courtesan even with the starting conflict with the Mandalorians.

“There is someone asking specifically for you.” She said with a frown. “Says it is really urgent but won’t tell me more.”

Dooku raised an eyebrow. “Who is it?”

“I don’t know. He and his female companion are wearing mandalorian clothing but no armor. Maybe they have information about the starting war.” She looked down at her data pad. “He says his name is Obi-Wan Kenobi.”

Dooku was on his feet before he realized it and pushed past the secretary to open the door. “Where is he?”

She frowned at his strange behavior. “Just down the hall in my office. What are you…”

Dooku nearly ran down the hall a bad feeling forming in his stomach. He ripped open the door open and for the first time saw Qui-Gon’s padawan face-to-face. He was pretty sure the young man hadn’t been so skinny in the holograms – cheeks sunken in and clothes hanging off his thin frame. Neither had he had deep shadows under his eyes or several bruises and small cuts decorating his pale face.

As Dooku entered the room the kid turned to him with an apologetic look stumbling a bit. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know where else to go.” 

And he fainted.

Chapter Text
Obi-Wan awoke slowly. He was surrounded by warmth and a familiar hand was brushing along his hair-line in big strokes. For a moment he thought he was back at the temple. Maybe he was so sick? His master had sat down at his bedside as he always did when Obi-Wan was little and had nightmares. Maybe all of the last year had just been a fever dream. Maybe…Then the hand went a bit lower on its next stroke and brushed the painful welts on Obi-Wan’s throat making him wince in pain.“Padawan?” Qui-Gon sounded distraught enough for Obi-Wan to force open his heavy eyelids.He forced himself to a smile. “Hello master. It’s been awhile.”Qui-Gon let out something that sounded like a choked-off sob. “It has. What in the forces name happened? You look like you came straight out of a warzone.”“Well…” Obi-Wan didn’t think it was the right time to tell him he kind of came out of two active warzones… after having escaped slavery. No need to bring up the Melida/Daan thing. “After being thrown out of the temple I kind of…”“You were THROWN OUT?” Qui-Gon sounded appalled.“You… you didn’t know?”“Of course not.” The hand in Qui-Gon’s lap twitched. “Did you honestly think I would have just sat by as you were thrown out?”“I…” Obi-Wan looked anywhere but his master’s eyes. “I thought you might be angry at me. The Keepers said…” He bit his lip and dared a glance at Qui-Gon’s stone-like face. “You… really didn’t know?”Suddenly his upper body was lifted off the bed as his master pulled him in a bone-crushing hug that was too nice to complain about how painful it was. “I swear to you I didn’t know. They said that you were sick and that you were angry at me – that you didn’t want to see me. I’m sorry, Obi-Wan, I should have never believed them! I swear I already decided I would march into the temple next week and demand to see you if nothing else worked.”Something broken in Obi-Wan started to bend itself back together. “It’s okay, master.” He whispered patting Qui-Gon’s back. “I believe you.”Maybe he hadn’t been abandoned after all.  The knock startled Obi-Wan out of his dose. He seemed to have nodded off at some point of reading his book which had fallen down on his chest as his eyes had closed. Obi-Wan still wasn’t fully healed up and tired quite easy even after days of proper food and rest.There was another knock and Obi-Wan sat up and tried to straighten up his hair. “Yes?”Count Dooku was leaning into the room. “May I enter?”“Su…sure!” Obi-Wan stuttered. The Sith lord still made him nervous. “It’s your room.”“The room is yours for as long as you want it.” The Count disagrees. “And you can determine who may enter or not.” He stayed at the door waiting.Obi-Wan swallowed hard then managed to bring out: “Then I’m telling you that you may enter.”“Thank you.” The Count bowed his head and walked into the room, closed the door and seated himself on a small sofa near the window. “I hoped you felt well enough for a short conversation.”“Oh, I… eh, yes?” It sounded more like a question then it should have and Obi-Wan winced.The Count gave him a kind smile. “I wanted to apologize.”“What? Why?” Of all the things he could have said Obi-Wan hadn’t expected that.“I was the reason Qui-Gon left the temple.” The man explained. “I have also dismissed his increasing concerns about you for far too long. Had I gone to the temple the first time he asked most of this could have been avoided.”“I… it wasn’t your fault that Darth Sidious started a trade war.” Obi-Wan frowned. “Qui-Gon left to insure millions of people – myself included – would get enough food to survive. That was far more important than…” Me, he didn’t say.The Count looked pained. “Qui-Gon and I were in an impossible situation and we did what he considered right. Your master always had your well-being as his main concern, I can assure you. Still the outcome has been less than desirable. I still regret in not acting sooner and getting you the proper help you needed.”Obi-Wan shrugged and looked down at his hands. “After I left the temple it would have been nearly impossible to find me anyway.”“We would have.” Dooku answered and there was a dark ring to the force that told Obi-Wan he was telling the truth.Obi-Wan bit his lip. It had been awhile since someone had assured him such protection. He wasn’t quite sure if he believed it. The galaxy had turned out much harsher than he expected it to be. “What…” He took a deep breath and looked up at Dooku again. “What will happen to me now?”“That is up to you. You may stay here as long as you want - actually Qui-Gon and I would prefer if you stayed at least until you have fully recovered. Afterwards…” Dooku put his hands together in a thoughtful gesture. “I am ready to offer you an apprenticeship as my student. If the life as a Sith doesn’t suit you you may still remain in my home as my surrogate son. Or…” He pursed his lips slightly. “…you could return to the Jedi temple.”Obi-Wan frowned. “I was expelled from the temple.”“I have talked to the ones responsible.” Dooku answered with a dark glint in his eyes. “And the temple is more than happy to allow you to return. I assure you if you return either Qui-Gon or I will visit REGULARLY to make sure something like… this never happens again.”“Oh.” Obi-Wan blinked in surprise. “They’d really take me back?”The Count sighed and stood up. “My dear boy, they would be stupid not to.”  
“Your cloak is covered in blood, dearest,” Qui-Gon had greeted Dooku on his return from Coruscant the morning before Obi-Wan woke.

“You should be with your padwan.” The Sith had responded striding past him.

“Obi-Wan has been given a sedative by the healers.” Qui-Gon had no problem keeping peace. “He will not awaken before the afternoon.” He had cooked his head. “You were in the temple weren’t you?”

Dooku had sighed and stopped walking to turn to Qui-Gon. “Yes.”

“How many of the Keepers did you kill?”

“That is not a question a Jedi should need to concern themselves with.” Dooku had pressed a short kiss to Qui-Gon’s cheek. “Take care of your padawan.”

Qui-Gon had grabbed the front of his blood-soaked robes and had pulled him in to a passionate kiss. He had leaned back to whisper. “Thank you.”
  Satine Kyrze left the Serenno soon after Obi-Wan waking up. While both had gotten close during their time together for Satine duty was always most important. Obi-Wan felt slightly disappointed as she left but he wasn’t surprised. He had always admired her for what she was and could hardly blame her now for following her nature. Hopefully one day their paths would cross again.  Life on Serenno felt a bit like a dream. The bed was softer than anything Obi-Wan had ever felt, the food was mouth-watering and far more exotic than he was used to and he still was surprised by all the attention he got from everyone. The servants and visitors treated him like royalty. As he got closer to the kitchen staff, his favorite cook told him in secret how most of them adored Qui-Gon who was friendly and kept Dooku’s temper in check. Being Qui-Gon’s padawan combined with Dooku’s care for him had made Obi-Wan become quite popular.Qui-Gon and Dooku also did their best to give him daily attention no matter how exhausting their daily lives were. As Obi-Wan became stronger he took part in their daily stretching and sparing.“Soresu.” Qui-Gon commented after Obi-Wan was finally allowed to use his light saber again. “You changed your light saber technique.”Obi-Wan defended against another hit from Dooku and took a step back. It was clear that Dooku wasn’t attacking with his all but he still gave Obi-Wan plenty to do.“Yes,” Obi-Wan was too busy avoiding the red saber again to look at Qui-Gon but he felt the long-established guilt bubbling in his stomach. “I fear Ataru didn’t feel right for me the last few months. I apologize.”It was usual that a padawan would use the same saber technique as their master. Using a different technique could be seen disrespectful or even as an insult. The last thing Obi-Wan wanted to do now was insult his master.“No need to apologize.” Qui-Gon looked fascinated at the sparing match in front of him. “I suits you.”Obi-Wan turned his head to look at his master in astonishment and was immediately thrown to the ground with a well-aimed kick.Dooku stood over him with an amused expression. “You still need to work on your attention span though.”“Yes milord.” Obi-Wan groaned. “I’ll work on it.”“Please, no need for formality.” Dooku offered him a hand. “My name is Yan Dooku.”Obi-Wan let himself be helped up. “Thank you… Yan.”Dooku gave him the widest smile he had ever seen from him.  After lunch they usually sat down for an hour. Dooku and Qui-Gon did paperwork for the Empire while Obi-Wan allowed to read whatever book he found interesting in the library so far.“Qui-Gon told me you appreciated a good cup of tea as well.” Dooku told him the first time they sat down. “But that the selection of the temple is usually pretty restrictive.”Obi-Wan hadn’t wanted to talk bad about his home even though he agreed in secret. “I guess it can be a bit limited.”“Well then.” Dooku had smiled. “We need to educate you.”Since then they tried a new kind of tea every day they sat down. It was one of favorite parts of Obi-Wan’s day now. While drinking his tea Obi-Wan was on occasion included into the political talk that Dooku and Qui-Gon had but mostly he remained silent. He hadn’t known how cut off he was from what happening at the moment in the galaxy before he listened to them. The temple taught a lot of history about what happened and why it happened but there was little talk about recent events. He was determined to learn everything he could about it to lose some of his ignorance.At the moment Qui-Gon was talking about the conflict between the trading confederation and Naboo that still continued after years.“You should probably visit Naboo soon.” Obi-Wan commented without thinking. “It sounds like personal negotiations are needed.”He looked up fast enough from his tea to see his master and Dooku exchange a meaningful look. They seemed to agree on something because Qui-Gon nodded and gave Obi-Wan a smile. “You are right on the long run but it can wait for now.”Obi-Wan frowned. “People are suffering now, why would you wait before solving the problem?” He felt both their gazes resting on him full off… concern? Worry? Oh. Oh, of course. “You aren’t going because of me, right?”“Obi-Wan, you’re still recovering.” Qui-Gon pointed out.“I can look out for myself!” Obi-Wan protested.Dooku sighed. “Obi-Wan Jedi do not leave the temple for a reason. Even here on my home-planet I cannot completely assure your physical and mental safety if Qui-Gon and I aren’t here. There are still too many of Palpatine’s men still around. And I cannot let Qui-Gon go into enemy territory alone either.”“I have looked out for myself and Satine for several months now and we’re both unharmed!”“I would define unharmed differently.” Dooku replied skeptically.Qui-Gon cut in. “Obi-Wan, both of us aren’t really worried about you protecting yourself if you get bodily attacked but you tend to… take harsh words to heart easily.”“You think a few words could make me shut down!” Obi-Wan pressed out between gritted teeth.“I don’t want to see you hurt because of me, padawan!”Obi-Wan stood abruptly so that the chair behind him fell to the ground with a crash. “A bit late for that isn’t it.” He saw the hurt on Qui-Gon’s face and railed his sudden anger back in. All his master ever did was to protect him he KNEW that but… “I need to think for a bit.”And he rushed out of the room.  Dooku found him sitting in the garden look into the sunset a few hours later. Instead of saying anything Dooku sat down beside him and followed his gaze to look at the orange and red colors decorating the sky.Obi-Wan spoke first. “I would make a pretty bad Sith, wouldn’t I?”“I do not think that it’s a life style that would suit you.” Dooku agreed.Obi-Wan let out a harsh laugh. “You make a good diplomat, you know. Probably how you got your job in the first place.”“Diplomacy in contrast to the dark side is something you share my talent in.” Dooku pointed out. “One day you could do great things with it.”“But in the moment I’m holding you and Qui-Gon back, don’t I?” Obi-Wan said. “You can’t take me with you as a student but you also can’t take me with you as another Courtesan because people would notice you treat me differently to Qui-Gon. And you can’t leave me here either because you aren’t in control of the situation yet.”“The situation isn’t the easiest.” Dooku agreed. “But we can find a solution that suits us all. We can make up another tradition for Jedi outside of the temple, we can…”“I need to go back to the temple.” In some part of his mind Obi-Wan had always known that to be true. It felt good to finally say it out loud.“You don’t have to…”“But I do!” Obi-Wan disagreed. “I still haven’t learned a lot of the things I need to know before I’m ready to live outside the temple without someone needing to look out for my every step. I’m still a padawan – a student.”Dooku looked at him with concern written in every part of his face. “Are you sure this is what you want?”“No.” Obi-wan admitted. “But I know that it’s the right thing to do.”“Obi-Wan Kenobi, you are better than this galaxy could ever deserve.” Dooku pulled him into a side-hug and Obi-Wan slumped against him. “And one day you’ll find someone who recognizes that and can protect you in a way Qui-Gon and I just aren’t able to at this moment.”Obi-Wan sniffed. “Thank you.”Dooku pulled back and forced the padawan to look in his eyes. “I promise to never leave you alone like before again. We will check up on you every week, you will never fully get rid of us.”Obi-Wan felt the corner of his mouth rise up. “Even if I become a Courtesan myself?”“Even then.” Dooku smiled. “They wouldn’t be the first Sith I kill.”“I will tell them if I ever meet them.” Obi-Wan chuckled.“You will.” Dooku told him. “One day you will.”Over a decade later Darth Vader visited the Jedi temple for the first time to look for a Courtesan.




Notes:

That's it for now. I do intend to put a few other one-shots into this series so stay tuned but it won't be as fast or regularly as the first two stories.For anyone wanting to read more Star Wars stuff from me, I just published a new story about a Clone revolution because the Clones deserved better: Forcing them into their luck Or maybe my older one about Anakin getting thrown out of the temple because of his secret marriage which leads him and Padme to work together to save their friends, beat Palpatine and become Emprerors: The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down"

Chapter Text

 
As the droid factory Yan Dooku had resided in for the last few weeks had been blown to pieces he had to admit he had been expecting Skywalker to wait for him as he ran to the starship hanger or maybe Kenobi – most likely both of them at once considering they seemed to be connected by the hip.Instead he found himself surrounded by clones on all sides as he stepped into the room. He drew his lightsaber but not lit it yet. He turned on his heel until he faced the clone with the highest rank according to their armor distinctions. “Where have you left your masters, you loyal lap dogs?”The clone in front of him took off his helmet showing off a short haircut and a scar on the left side of his face.“Count Dooku, you claim the republic is full of corruption and needs to be dissolved.” The clone said. “I agree.”Dooku cocked his head and slowly let his weapon sink to his side. “I’m listening.”   “General Kenobi, I really think it would be better for you to visit the Medics.”“I’m fine, Cody.” The light tone in Obi-Wan’s voice probably would have deceived most people.Commander Cody wasn’t most people. “You’re limping, Sir.”“I’m resting my leg.”“Maybe you wouldn’t need to rest your leg if you went to the medics?”“A tempting idea but I fear I need to finish these reports until Anakin’s ship reaches us and he involves us in his next horrific plan or crash landing.”“I think in that case sleeping beforehand will probably be better for all our sakes.”“Oh I don’t know.” Obi-Wan gave him a cheeky smile. “If I finish the report before Anakin gets us all killed at least the Jedi Council has something to remember me by.” He gave a quick wave and rushed out the door.Cody sighed as he watched him leave. “You aren’t easy to forget, Sir.”Waxer stepped next to Cody and saluted. “Sir, should I get the narcotics?”“Get the narcotics and all the tea you can find.” He put his hand on Waxer’s shoulder. “We have a mission now.”   “General Skywalker, I don`t think this is a good ide…” Rex broke off and let out a deep sigh. He activated his comm. “General Skywalker just jumped out of the ship.”“Well,” Fives answered back via com. “At least he didn’t crash it.”“Does anyone have line of sight with the General?” Rex asked.“Not exactly.” Fox reported. “But you know how Commander Tano was on our ship?”“Was?” Rex repeated.“Yeah, she just jumped after him.”“WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE SKYWALKER THE ROLEMODEL TO A TEENAGER?”“Probably whoever gave Skywalker to Kenobi as a student when Kenobi was 25.”“Now I know who is at fault for all of this!”   “General Windu, you don’t really want to follow this order.”“You heard what the Senator just said.”“But this is a suicide mission!” Ponds sounded exasperated.Only a twitch in Mace’s eyebrow showed how stressed he was. “We were given an order.”“That will get us all killed!”“No.” Mace held up a hand. “You and your man will stay here; this mission is far too dangerous for you.”“But the senator said…” Ponds started.“That I have to go on this mission.” Mace interrupted him. “Not that you have to follow.”“But General…” Ponds protested.“I expect you to follow orders just like the rest of us.” Mace demanded then turned around and left the stuttering clone alone.Ponds sighed and got out a long-range communicator with a connection to a galaxy encompassing written message system. Maybe Rex would have an idea how to break the rules in a way that even Mace Windu would accept - force knew General Skywalker gave a lot of experience on the topic.He wasn’t the only one who was writing:   “General Koon’s mask has been damaged in battle but he refuses to leave the front because civilian lives are at risk. Any tips on how to get a suicidal Jedi from the front? Or maybe how to mend a broken Kel’Dor-oxygen mask while getting shot at by clankers?”“Narcotics and a lot of tea.”“I think that only works with General Kenobi, Cody.”“No, I once saw it work on General Yoda… although I’m still not sure if he only acted like he didn’t notice us mixing it into his tea.”“Commander Offee just nearly lost an arm because she desperately needed to protect a one of a kind book. General Unduli scolded her and then nearly lost her head doing the same thing. Can I just make both of them sit down and write lines? Or maybe ground them?”“General Fisto keeps jumping into water to get past the clankers without warning us. Somebody tell him that most races can’t breathe under water!”“General Skywalker crash-landed another ship.”“HOW? I TOOK MY EYES OFF HIM FOR FIVE MINUTES!!!”   Rex breathed a sigh of a relief when he finally saw the message that they all had been waiting on for months by now:“Negotiations successful. Execute order 99.”“Good news Rex?” Anakin smiled up at him from where he was sitting with a singed eyebrow. The fact that he was actually sitting down instead of moving with a constant endless energy said a lot more about his condition than Anakin himself would ever say.“Yes Sir.” Rex agreed and pulled his gun out of his holster under the table as inconspicuously as he could.“Did we finally get some vacation time on Coruscant allotted?”“Something like that, Sir.”Rex saw out the corner of his eyes how his brothers were making themselves ready to attack as well. At once they all raised their guns at Anakin. “Sorry Sir, this is for your own good.”Rex shot."

Chapter Text
The ship has a hole in it.Or at least, that’s what Threepio says, sounding distraught, and Leia believes him over her parents, who insist everything is completely fine. She knows when adults say that, everything is probably just the opposite. Also the hull is smoking.Leia is holed up in the bridge of the small ship, along with what seems like every other member of the twenty-person crew. So there’s definitely a hole in the ship.The ship rumbles and jerks around unpredictably, tossing people into the walls and control panels, but Leia isn’t terribly concerned. If the damage were that threatening, they would have ejected in the escape pods, but instead they’re going to touch down for repairs on a nearby planet.The planet is called Tatooine, and her parents whisper the name to each other like it’s something terribly secret and exciting. Anxious energy swirls around Leia’s parents the way it does whenever they don’t want her to know something, which means she absolutely has to find out.Leia plasters herself to the port view window, lifting herself up onto her tip-toes to see better. The second the blue lines of hyperspace shorten into stars and they snap into place, she sees it.The planet is entirely orange, and possibly the most uninteresting one Leia has ever seen (this makes five, now). She wrinkles her nose and thinks her parents have strange taste in secret planets.Still, she muses, maybe she can think of the planet’s blank face as mysterious. Looking closer, Leia spots some fierce winds below that look rather dangerous and exciting.Yes, that sounds loads more interesting.Throughout the landing cycle, Leia occupies herself with thinking up ideas of what might be hiding beneath what she can now see are furious clouds of sand. Perhaps there will be something hidden underground, or old caves. She hopes there are old caves.By the time the ship has touched the surface, Leia has worked herself into such an excitement that she’s practically vibrating in the seat her mother made her take upon entering the atmosphere.Her parents seem awfully anxious. Her father’s brow has furrowed in worry and her mother grips her hand tightly as the ramp descends. Despite herself, Leia feels herself becoming wary. She’s adventuresome, not stupid, and she knows better than to ignore signs when she sees them.So, as Leia descends the ramp into the blistering heat and raging wind, she grasps her parents’ hands tightly, and resolves not to let go.-Tatooine is just as dusty as it looks. There’s sand in her hair, sand in her mouth and her clothes, nothing but sand as far as the eye can see. It’s hot and windy but there’s something in the air that sings and Leia knows there something more to the planet that she can’t see. And it’s got two suns. Leia’s never been to a planet with two suns before. Mother and Father talk with a dusty looking mechanic who has a large scar over his eye that Leia thinks is severely cool. They raise their voices above the wind, but Leia can still hardly hear what they’re saying. In the end, the mechanic and her mother shake hands (the one not holding hers) and they part ways. Her parents tell her it’s going to take a while. With nothing to do, the Organa’s and their crew go in search of somewhere to hunker down for the next several hours or however long it will take to patch the hole in the ship. Threepio is told to stay with the ship, which he gladly accepts to do. He says the sand feels awfully grinding in his joints. Their way takes them through a market that Leia is properly delighted by. It has loads of colors and food and scary looking people speaking in rough tongues.But in shadowed corners are people whose heads hang low and whose feet drag in the sand, and the air around them is so heavy and distressing that Leia feels well and truly scared like she hasn’t in years. Leia frowns deeply and opens her mouth to ask who those people are, but her mother steers them sharply away. Her father presses his lips into a thin line. She thinks maybe this marketplace isn’t so delightful after all.-Leia shouldn’t have let go of her parents’ hands, but she’s got it into her head that there’s adventure to be had and mysteries to be solved here, so she quietly wanders off, trying to stay within sight. Leia begins to let the spark of excitement build in her chest, the kind that comes with being lost and learning new things and uncovering secrets. Tatooine is certainly different from any of the planets she’s been to before, all of which have predominantly been green or blue or durasteel grey. None of them have had anything close to the hostile atmosphere of the desert planet she’s on now.The air shimmers and sways out over the golden dunes, which look oddly to her like the sea. The suns (she still can’t get over the fact that there are two of them) have passed their peak now and are on the descent, and she thinks the sky around them looks unnaturally blue, without a cloud to be seen. Mostly it seems like the people around here wear heavy scarves or wide hats that Leia loves the look of. Properly mysterious.She’s being careful, really, she is! But there’s so much to see, and her parents walk so slowly! A particularly colorful stall catches her eye, and she wanders a little too far. The storm has kicked up suddenly into something furious that scrapes at her cheeks and gets in her eyes, and her parents are all the way on the other side of the market. She can’t see them anywhere. In fact, she can’t see much of anything other than the sandy blur.She considers calling out, but she can hardly hear her own thoughts, much less her voice. And so Leia stumbles her way to a small alleyway that provides a small amount of cover and curls herself up small to shield her face.When the winds have died down, she’ll ask to borrow a comm unit somewhere to call her mother with, and everything will be just fine, she assures herself. Except, there’s someone else in this alleyway.Leia watches the person from the corner of her eye and gets a slimy feeling from him when he eyes her up and down. He also has a big scar on his face, but instead of finding it cool, Leia is just unsettled.“Hello there, little lady,” says the man, “You’ll catch your death in this storm, come with me, I can get you some shelter.It’s textbook kidnapping strategy, and Leia is almost slack-jawed at the man’s boldness. Leia considers her options. This man is fairly tall and strong looking, so she absolutely can’t let him grab her. She evaluates her escape rout into the street. The wind is starting to let up already and she can see the other side somewhat clearly. Most people have retreated indoors, but a fair number have simply opted to shelter themselves behind stalls.“No, thank you,” Leia says politely as she stands, “I’m perfectly fine.”“I’m sure you are,” says the man, stepping closer, “but I’ll wager you’re not from around here. Let me help you.”Leia shuffles closer to the street, “No, thank you.” She says more firmly.It seems to her like this is not a man of patience, and he throws away his paper thin act at the drop of a hat to lunge at her and this is it, Leia thinks. She’s been trained for this.She runs. Turning sharply and dodging the hand coming towards her, Leia runs and yells at the top of her lungs just like father told her.Leia has quite the impressive set of lungs on her, mind you (she knows because plenty of people have told her so), but apparently even her voice is nothing against the rage of the storm. That, or people on Tatooine can’t be bothered to care about a child yelling kidnapper! She doesn’t like how the second option rings true in her mind.Nonetheless, Leia runs with the fury of a starving nexu and doesn’t stop even when she can’t hear the man’s heavy footsteps behind her, or his frustrated huffs and puffs. In fact, she’s run so far that she’s run herself right out of the storm. She watches with fascination as a tall, sparkling wall of sandy clouds floats right over the ground in one big clump.She can’t decide if it looks more or less violent from the outside, but it’s definitely beautiful. Either way, she’s well and truly lost now. Leia spins around a couple times in every direction, but nothing is familiar. Looking out at the vast expanse of the dunes, she supposes she must be on the very outskirts of the town. The colorful stalls and lively bustle have turned into round, pale-colored buildings and narrow streets. With her mind set, Leia marches of precisely in that direction, for no particular reason other than that she feels like it. And what a feeling it is! Leia’s heart soars for a moment with the freedom of being lost before it’s sobered again by the same thought, and her stride slows to a stop.Leia only sees a few people walking around from shadow to shadow. Suddenly, it occurs to her that she’s really, very hot, even with her white hood shielding her neck and face.After relocating to a small stretch of shade by one of the only rectangular shaped buildings with a little portion of roof outstretched, Leia crouches down and begins to consider her options. She doesn’t suppose she can find her parents herself anymore. It sure seems like she’s come a long way. She doesn’t see any public comm units either.She could ask for help, but none of the people she’s seen have looked like women, and Leia’s mother told her always to look for a woman if she’s lost. Preferably one with a child if she has options.Leia doesn’t know if that rule also applies to Tatooine, but after the encounter she just had, she doesn’t really feel like risking it.What to do…Leia cushions her cheek on one of her knees drawn close to her chest. This isn’t exactly the adventure she had in mind. There’s a whole desert right there just waiting to be explored, but she’s fairly positive she would die within twenty minute of being out there in her current state of dress and preparedness.A long while goes by of hugging her knees, watching sand get swept off of the tips of the dunes, and letting the tightness in her chest grow until she can’t take it anymore, and pushes herself to her feet with cracking force.Well there’s no point in sitting around and sulking, she scolds herself, she might as well explore the little streets of the town if she can’t explore the dunes. Maybe she’ll run into her parents. Who knows?Leia nearly jumps out of her skin when someone taps her on the shoulder.Immediately, she whirls around, ready to strike, but is stalled by the fact that the face she sees is rather at eye level. Actually, a little lower.Before her stands a boy that looks around her age. He wears loose, light-colored clothes and has a brown bag slung over his shoulder. He has golden hair and sun touched skin and a bright face. Something tingles up her spine.“Who are you?” Leia demands, in her very most authoritative princess voice, and the boy flinches back in surprise. She raises her hands in front of her like her self-defense instructors taught her (she only started two months ago, but the boy doesn’t know that).“What? Oh, um, I’m Luke!” The boy declares, wide eyed, “What’s your name?”Leia narrows her eyes at this “Luke”, wondering where boys lie in terms of safety on a scale from women with children to slimy, scarred men in alleyways. Well, she’s not giving anyone her name right off the bat, that’s for sure. So instead she says, “What do you want?”The boy looks properly intimidated as he stumbles with his words, and Leia stands up straighter in satisfaction, “Well, you looked kinda lost, so I wondered if you needed help.” For the life of her, Leia can’t sense any kind of dishonesty from Luke, who looks nervous but earnest as he shifts from foot to foot and fidgets with a strange bit of metal. “Why?” She asks, finally.Luke looks at her like she’s crazy, “…Because you looked like you needed help?”How does she even begin to explain that that’s not how things work? That, in this galaxy, the only people who do things like that are also people who get swindled on the streets or get their identities stolen. Despite herself, Leia feels concerned for this boy, and hopes he doesn’t make similar offers to just anyone who looks out of place.Still, it’s a good enough answer in her books, and she’s not going to find her parents on her own. “Fine, you can help me.” She ignores the fact that he hasn’t actually asked yet in favor of thrusting out her hand. “I’m Leia,” she says, omitting her last name and title because it’s always good to maintain at least a small amount of caution.Luke’s face brightens by magnitudes. He grins and takes her hand to shake. “Hi, Leia, nice to meet you!”Somehow, she thinks he really means it.

Chapter Text
Luke has a speeder nearby that he says he flew here, which is so incredibly unfair because Leia’s father won’t let her fly one until she’s sixteen, and Luke is only twelve (hey, we’re the same age!) Luke looks just as scandalized about it as she feels.“How do you go anywhere?” Luke asks, looking genuinely concerned. Leia tells him she’s not allowed to go anywhere alone, so there’s always an adult to drive the speeder. He wrinkles his nose, “That’s ridiculous.” Leia wholeheartedly agrees.Luke is all big, goofy smiles for no reasons that are apparent to her, and she wonders if that’s just what his face looks like. He’s social and almost as talkative as Leia, even though he lets her interrupt him without a fuss every time. He’s bright and nice and a little strange and Leia decides she likes him instantly.As they walk through the maze of identical domed buildings, Leia entertains herself with kicking a rock along in front of her. “Do you live around here?” She asks. Privately, she thinks this doesn’t look like a very nice place to live. There aren’t any mountains or woods, and Leia wouldn’t like to live anywhere without woods to run in and trees to climb. It’s also really hot here, she thinks, and tries to ignore the sweat gathering on her back.Luke tells her he doesn’t. He holds up a spiraled, rusty piece of metal with a wide smile and says he just came here to get an inductor coil for one of their malfunctioning vaporators. “It took me hours to find one that would fit!” Leia doesn’t know what those words mean, but she isn’t going to admit that, so instead she says: “Oh,” and glances at the worn cloth bag Luke shoves the piece into, its reddish color fading to brown, “then where do you live?” Further out towards the Dunes, he tells her. He says his aunt and uncle have a comm unit she can use back at what he calls the “Homestead,” which must be where he lives. It’s a farm, Luke says, and Leia thinks there’s something exciting about that, too.Leia doesn’t ask why he says “aunt and uncle” and not “mother and father” because she knows that would be rude, but she does wonder. “What kind of farm?” She asks instead.He says, “A moisture farm.”“What, like for water?” “Yeah, that’s only only kind of farm that matters, around here.” He looks at her like the question is strange. Leia can see how that would make sense, in a desert, so she nods in understanding, but in the privacy of her mind, she still thinks it’s weird to farm water.“What are you doing out here?” Luke kicks her rock back to her when its path goes crooked, “You look like an off-worlder.”A moment passes where Leia has to think about whether or not she should feel insulted by that, but she remembers what most of the people looked like in the marketplace and drops it. “My parents are getting repairs on the ship,” she says, then explains how she got separated from them.“Yeah,” Luke says sympathetically, “that can happen. He was probably a snatcher.”“A what?”“A snatcher. They like to snatch kids to sell them.”Well, that doesn’t make any sense. She stops kicking her rock to turn her attention to Luke. “What do you mean?” Leia frowns, “You can’t sell people.” “Maybe not where you’re from, but you can here,” Luke replies, then frowns, “but you shouldn’t.""“No, you can’t,” Leia insists, “It’s illegal!” She knows that for sure. It’s called ‘slavery’ and it’s definitely against the law on a galactic scale.“I don’t think that applies here, since the Hutts are in charge. They’re the biggest slavers in the galaxy,” he explains.A tight feeling twists in Leia’s chest the way it always does when she doesn’t understand something. “But that’s wrong.” She argues simply.“I know that!” Luke replies, a touch defensively, “But it happens anyway.”They grow quiet after that, and Leia goes back to kicking her rock with slightly more force than is advisable for optimal rock-retention. The people Leia had seen in the market come to mind, with their shackled feet and hollow expressions, and her stomach tightens. She decides this planet is strange, and wishes it would follow the rules.When she gets back to her parents, she’ll tell them about what Luke said. Her father works in the senate, and she knows that’s where things like this get talked about. And her mother is a queen. Leia is fairly certain there nothing she can’t do.They reach the speeder and hop in. To Leia’s great envy, Luke really can fly it. The metal on the outside almost burns her whole hand off as she gets in. It’s an ancient pile of junk, in her not so humble opinion. Half of the siding is missing and the hood is gone entirely, and is thus covered with a tarp that flaps loudly in the wind. She’s shocked it even flies at all, what with its sputtering and shaking“Something’s smoking,” Leia points out, spotting grey wisps floating up from the back. “Don’t worry,” Luke waves his hand dismissively, “it does that.”Leia is always one for adventure, but she’s also one for staying alive and unmaimed. This speeder does not pass her standards of safe transportation, and she keeps her eyes warily trained on the various sheets of metal that shutter in the wind and groan when Luke makes a turn. With a devilish smile that catches her off guard, Luke asks if she wants to see a trick. With all her heart, Leia is terrified of what that is supposed to mean. He wants to do a trick? “In this heap of garbage?""Luke assures her that he does it all the time, and, “it’s gonna be wizard, I promise!” Leia doesn’t believe him for a second, but he looks really excited, and she might be just a little bit curious. Luke whoops when she agrees and steers them over to a rockier terrain, full of canyons and stone pillars.She has no idea what the trick is. She squeezes her eyes shut and grips the door as soon as the speeder starts tilting on its side. Her stomach manages a whole somersault and Luke is belly laughing when it’s over. He gives her an expectant look that says, So? It was cool, right? I told you it would be.Leia asks if he’s trying to get them killed. He tells her he’s not, and she’s less than inclined to believe him. He juts out his lip in an offended pout, so she punches him in the arm. “Maybe it was a little bit cool,” she says. “Just a tiny bit. But don’t do it again, I wan’t to live.” He promises he won’t and drives on happily after that.At one point, something behind Leia’s seat makes a deafening pop! and she nearly launches herself out of the speeder in fright. “Oh,” Luke twists to look behind himself, then slows the speeder to a halt near the base of a cliff, “sorry, I think the repulsor coupling came loose again,” then he hops over the side to rustle through the storage compartment.Trying not to think too deeply about the fact that they’re riding in a death trap, Leia also gets out, and relocates to a spot several paces away, where she thinks she would probably be out of range of an explosion. At least the shade is nice. It quickly becomes clear that sitting over here in the shade is boring, so she moves back over to the hovering time bomb to offer her help. Luke doesn’t need it, so she just crouches and listens to him talk about how repulsor couplings should really have lipped edges rather than flush ones, in his opinion. That way he would be able to remove and replace it more easily. Leia thinks that whole point is that you should never have to remove or replace it at all. It should just stay there and work. Something heavy gradually builds in Leia’s stomach, and she eventually decides that she’s getting tired, and that she would like to get back to her parents now, actually. It all hits her quite hard, and she grows silent in favor of cushioning her head on her knees and frowning at the reddish sand. “…Are you okay?” Luke peeks out from under the speeder, with grease on his nose and cheek. She wrinkles her nose a bit at the smell of oil. Feeling a little annoyed at how easily Luke picks up on her changes in mood, she thinks he’s more observant than he lets on.It's hard to feel defensive in the face of Luke's sincerity. Leia isn’t sure what gets her to admit it, but she doesn’t feel like lying and saying that she is. She tells him she’s tired, and that she misses her parents. It’s a bit of a shock when the words come out of her mouth, because she hadn’t fully processed them yet.Luke hums, “Yeah, I miss my Aunt and Uncle all the time,” he says, and for some reason his tone is actually kind of comforting. He says it so casually, like Leia hasn’t just confessed to an unforgivable weakness. “But don’t worry! I just got it all fixed up, so we can head out. Then we can call your parents!” He pops back up and tosses the hydrospanner into the back.Just that moment, something small and scaled scurries out of the speeder with Luke’s cloth bag between its teeth and makes for the rock formations. He yelps and tries to grab it, but it’s too quick.Thoughts of her parents and her exhaustion are swept right out of her mind at the sight of the scaly thing speeding away.“Your bag!” Leia jumps to her feet to give chase, but Luke snags her sleeve to stop her. She frowns at him. Doesn’t he want his stuff back?“Wait!” He cries, “Aunt Beru says not to go into the wastes! There could be raiders or womprats or-!”There are times in life when Leia knows she’s probably not making the smartest decision, like when she gets a handmaiden to swap clothes so she can escape an important party, or when she tries to sneak past the cook to get seconds of dessert. This is one of those times, but like all the others, she does it anyway, without a clue as to why. But she has the feeling that she absolutely has to follow that lizard.“We’re can’t let it get away so easily!” Besides, Leia’s father always tells her not to let anyone hold a debt over her head, because that’s how people become corrupt. Luke helped her out quite a lot, today, and Leia intends to pay him back in full. She doesn’t think he would try to manipulate her with favors, but that’s not the point. Luke doesn’t move, and Leia is not so above manipulation, so she plays her strongest card, “What? Are you scared?”“Yeah.”“Then-… Oh.” Leia frowns. He was supposed to fall into that trap and go along with her plan. This is somewhat of an unforeseen result, so she’ll have to improvise. “Well, don’t be,” she says, “I’ll protect you.”Then she grabs his hand and takes off running, following the trail of small objects fallen out of the bag as it was dragged.  They run and run, but the little creature is fast and clever and had a head start. It weaves in and out of cracks in the cliff faces and darts around corners. Huffing and puffing, the two of them follow it into what Leia recognizes with great delight as a cave.She knew there would be caves here.There isn’t time to appreciate her whereabouts, though, they’re still on a mission. She stays focused and keeps running with something wild and bright that swells in her chest. She thinks it feels like the kind of freedom she only finds in the back woods on Alderaan, with sticks in her hair and stains on her white dress. Laughter bubbles up from her throat, and she hears Luke begin to laugh, too, caught up in the moment. The cave turns out to be a series of many caves and tunnels, lit dimly by holes in the walls and Luke’s small flashlight. The suns have come to rest on the horizon now, and the light bleeds over the cave walls in shades of red and deep orange. It’s getting harder to see, and they lose the lizard a couple times before finding it again. The feeling builds and builds in her chest as they grow closer to the reptilian creature. She and Luke reach out to grab it as it jumps through a narrow crack in the wall. The two of them come crashing through into heap of limbs and dust. The first thing Leia sees is a pair of dirty, scuffed up boots. The angle doesn’t allow for her to see the owner of them, but a quick sweep around the rest of the place reveals it to be furnished, which she thinks is strange, because it’s a cave, and what cave has a stove and a dining table in it. Who lives in a cave? Probably someone with no where else to go, she reasons, but remains suspicious.Maybe this isn’t a proper cave at all, but a very poorly made (or strangely decorated) house. Luke and Leia untangle themselves as quickly as possible and right themselves. The boots owner is a man with a thick beard and reddish hair. He holds Luke’s bag (and the creature hanging off of it) in one hand, eyes blow wide in surprise.

Chapter Text
Leia’s first reaction is to grab Luke and shove him behind her, because his first reaction is to reach happily for his bag. One of them has to have some sense, after all, and she said she would protect him. This is a man. A rough, dirty-looking man who lives in a cave. A man who is not a woman or a child or a woman with a child, and who does not place well on her scale.Once again donning her very best princess voice, Leia demands to know who this man is, and what he is doing, loitering around in a cave. Luke tells her the man is ‘Old Ben,’ and she thinks he must not have seen very many elderly people before, because he doesn’t look that old to her. But looking closely, she supposes his eyes are heavy the way she’s seen in old people, and he’s got the beginnings of grey in his beard, so maybe he’s older than he looks.When Ben locks in on her presence, after somewhat awkwardly dislodging the lizard’s sharp teeth from the sleeve of his already tattered robes, she glares and lifts her chin, a clear invitation to try her and see what happens. She studies self-defense. For a moment he looks confused, then his eyes grow wide, then terribly heavy. The change is barely there before it’s gone again, and in the next moment he’s smiling a politician’s smile. She squints at him with suspicion.Apparently, this is where Ben lives, and Leia almost feels bad about the faces she made at it before. She didn’t think he actually lived here. It’s dimly lit and sparsely furnished, if you can even call it that. All the ‘furniture’ is actually just the cave wall, crudely carved away to look like furniture, and he has a single portable stove, on top of which is a teapot. This is not a nice place to live, she thinks. She wonders why he doesn’t live in one of the domed housed she saw before. Maybe he’s a hermit. She’s heard about those, though she’s never met one. “Your uncle would have my head if he knew you were out here past sunsdown.” Ben’s voice is jarringly core-worlder, and it throws her off for a moment. Luke squawks and spews denial that it’s not his fault. How was he supposed to know the speeder would break down? Or that the lizard would steal his bag?“How indeed,” Ben replies, with a dry voice and a glint of humor in his eyes, clearly egging Luke on.   With his hard-won inductor coil back in hand, Luke enthusiastically recounts the tale of how their chase came about in the first place. He tells is with much flourish and gratuitous use of the word ‘wizard’. “Yes, well, I can tell you that speeders are far less likely to break down when you fly them the way they are meant to be flown,” Ben teases good-naturedly, and Leia snickers at that. Luke huffs and rolls his eyes so hard she thinks they might come out of his head. He informs them with no small amount of sass that he flies perfectly well, it’s the speeder that’s not up to snuff.Ben chuckles lightly and strokes his beard. “My goodness,” he says, “You two have had quite the adventure indeed.” The words stoke the excited little flicker in Leia’s chest that says yes, we did, didn’t we? Ben clears his throat and pats his knees before standing up. “But it’s getting late now. You two had best be heading back.”Then he turns around and crosses his arms to stare intently at the kettle. It’s a clear dismissal.Leia blinks, then blinks again, incredulously. What gives?! He even looks like the type to help, a real sap for sad kids, she would have thought, based on his haggard, yet wisened appearance and deeply sympathetic face. Leia knows for sure this is the part where Ben is supposed to crumble in pity at their misfortune and offer to help them however he can. Asking for a comm link briefly crosses her mind before she looks around and concludes he probably doesn’t have one. “It isn’t on,” says Luke. Ben frowns, so he continues, “The kettle,” he elaborates, “you forgot to turn it on.”Ben’s eyebrows twitch up in surprise, “Oh,” he says, and flicks it on, “thank you.”“Aren’t you going to help us?” Leia demands, finally unable to hold it in longer. Ben blinks at her like he hasn’t the faintest clue what she’s talking about, and now he really looks like a politician. “I’m sure, I don’t know what you mean.”Leia fumes, “What kind of adult would let two children wander around in the desert alone? At night, too! Aren’t you going to offer to take us the rest of the way?”She’ll do anything not to get back into that death machine Luke calls a speeder.“Oh, don’t worry,” Ben waves, but doesn’t look at her, “Luke is perfectly capable of getting back home, he’s very smart.” Luke preens at the praise.“We’re just kids!” Ben twitches, and she knows she’s playing a winning game, “Are you really gonna make us go alone?”“Well, I’m really quite busy, actually-”“With your tea?”“With my tea.”“What if we stayed until after you finished your tea, and then you can take us?” Luke suggests, looking us from where he was poking through a bag of scrap metal in the corner.Ben looks between them with a reluctant scrunch between his brows. Leia puts on her most pitiable expression and Luke clasps his hands together pleadingly. “Please…” Leia says, “I just want to find my parents…”“Oh, alright,” Ben uncrosses his arms to plant them on his hips and unleashes a put-upon sigh. “But tea first.”  With a whoop, Luke sweeps over to what is probably the table, possibly just another vaguely flat rock, and sits down. Leia joins him smugly to watch Ben pour his cup of tea, glance at them for a moment, and fill two more cups. Luke accepts his with near reverence that Leia doesn’t understand. The tea tastes normal to her, if a little spicier than Alderaan’s brews.Sipping tea over the course of minutes, Leia watches the expressions flitter over Ben’s well-guarded features. He looks mostly exhausted and a little disbelieving, but his eyes look so, so heavy. She thinks he really does look old, now.This whole thing is the wrong way round. He’s the one who’s supposed to pity her.“Luke drives like a maniac,” Leia says, matter-of-factly, to break the silence, “the only reason we got out of the speeder in the first place is because it fell apart.”
“Hey!”
A curl pulls at the corner of Ben’s lips. He strokes a hand over his beard to hide it, “Yes, well, he informs me he’s very good at fixing it.”“That’s because I am!” Luke slaps his hands on the table, “I can fix anything! Ask Uncle Owen, he’ll tell you.”“That’s very admirable,” Ben says, sounding somewhat wistful, eyes heavy again, looking somewhere far off. He shakes his head and tries for a humorous tone, “It’s also good to know how to keep things from breaking, you know.” 
Luke mumbles to himself that he can, in fact, keep things from breaking, but why bother if he can fix it again? 
Ben and Leia share a look, after that, and they finish their tea in silence. Luke and Leia nod dutifully when Ben tells them to stay put, he’s going to gather his things. (He is gone for far longer than it takes to gather one’s things, she’s thinks, but he also looked about ready to topple over, for a minute there, so she figures he can be excused.)When Ben is gone, Luke leans over slightly to bump their shoulders together. Now that the adrenaline has drained away, Leia feels the tightness in her chest growing. The length of the day comes back to her, and it suddenly seems unbearably long a time since she’s seen her parents. It has been a very full day of adventure and danger, and while those things are great, Leia misses her mother and father. She leans into Luke’s shoulder.Luke says nothing for the time it takes for Leia to regain control over the sting of her eyes and the lump in her throat. She watches the inductor coil spin and spin in his hands, feeling awfully tired and hungry. Eventually, overtaken by restlessness and in desperate need of something else to think about, she says, “Do you trust him?”Luke tells her that he does. “Uncle Owen doesn’t like him, for some reason, but he always shows up when I get into trouble. He’s like a desert guardian!” Luke tells her about the time he crashed a speeder in Begger’s Canyon and the time he got caught in a sandstorm on the flats. He talks about how he thinks the desert probably tells Ben he’s in trouble, and that’s how he always knows.Leia asks what he means, and he tells her that the desert sings. His Aunt Beru taught him how to listen. And you have to listen close. He says the suns and the sands and the storm all have their own voices, that he’s never gotten lost in the desert because they always tell him which way to go. It sounds nice, Leia thinks, and not entirely unfamiliar. If she stretches her brain just right, something tingles at the edge of it that says she’s heard something similar before. She’s left with a slightly restless, wiggly feeling, sinking in the almost-memory. She was never taught how to listen.She asks Luke what it sounds like— the desert. He hums and furrows his brows and shifts around in his seat. Ultimately he says, “I think you just have to hear it.”It’s a supremely unsatisfying answer.They stare out the hole in the cave wall which Leia generously regards as a window. The view overlooks the horizon where the suns have sunk low beneath the dunes, where deep purple sky meets sands of an equally solemn orange. There’s something about the way Luke talks about the desert, with so much love and wonder, that creates a well in Leia’s chest. When she is older, she will recognize the feeling to be humility, but all the planets Leia has been to have been blue or green or durasteel grey and firmly in the core, where money flows like water. Her father teaches her to always be mindful of what she has and that other people might not have as much. Her mother teaches her always to thank attendants and the droids, because they deserve as much respect as anyone. But these lessons don’t prepare one for a life without those things. She has not yet seen enough of the galaxy to really understand what humility or privilege mean. Thus, Leia remains her very prideful self, feeling perhaps slightly embarrassed of her somewhat narrow-minded opinion of Tatooine.(It’s a steep learning curve, but this can be the start. She's always been good at climbing.)She misses Alderaan fiercely, with its tall, snow-capped mountains and lush forests. She even misses the air. Before coming to Tatooine, she hadn’t know air could be this dry.… Her parents are probably worried.A howl sounds in the distance, then another. A chorus of howls rings through the rock formations around them, echoing into something haunting. With stars in his eyes, Luke tells her they are the anooba, “do you want to hear their story?”Of course she does! She sits up excitedly at the prospect. They sound like just the sort of mysterious, dangerous monsters she is fascinated by.But Ben returns just then, and Luke doesn’t get to start his story. Leia squints. It looks like Ben has been through a tornado— his hair sticks up in every direction and his face looks rubbed raw and slightly manic. Leia wonders if they shouldn’t wait a bit before they go so he can have a lie down.Perhaps a bit selfishly, Leia suggests nothing. The suns have officially set, and she wants to go home. Thus, they follow Ben through the actual entrance to his cave-house, which is quite a bit larger than the hole they smashed through. Standing outside of it is a tall, thin-legged creature with a sloping back which Luke calls an “eopie.” Leia is immediately fascinated by it and declares as much. Ben sportingly lets her give it a little food. The three of them pile on with Leia in front, Luke in the middle, and Ben behind. The speeder will have to be collected tomorrow.The nights on Tatooine turn out to be a much bearable temperature than the days. The last shades of deep purple are fading away where the sky meets the sand, and stars begin to blink into existence. There are more than Leia has ever seen before, and she gazes at them quietly, wondering if one of them is Alderaan.It takes all of five minutes for Luke to fall asleep, face smooshed into Leia’s shoulder.Despite her long and arduous day, Leia feels no such pull of sleep. This eopie is slower than she thought it would be, and she quickly grows bored.“You’re from Coruscant,” she says.Ben makes a sound halfway between amused and defeated, “Yes.”“Why are you living out here, all alone?”“… It’s a long story,” Ben says, and Leia has heard that one before. It means, I don’t want to talk about it.Dutifully changing the topic, she says, “Why are you always saving Luke?”“Because he’s always getting himself into trouble, that boy.” There’s a very strange combination of wistfulness and amusement in Ben’s clear voice. This, too, is a fair answer. Leia bets Luke gets himself into all kinds of strange situations.After several minutes too many of trying to pick out her home among the countless specks of light above, Leia's curiosity wins out. “Why are you so sad?”It’s a rude question, but unfortunately, the day had wiped away a good many of her manners, and Ben hasn’t scolded her yet. He thinks about his answer and she cranes her head back to see him. Eventually, he says, with a crooked smile, “Why are you?”It’s a classic strategy, and fair enough. Deflecting a question you don’t want to answer with another question.“I’m tired,” she says, then looks away, “and I miss my family.”She’s not entirely sure why she told him. The admission is like a rock in her stomach. Somehow, it makes her feel weak, even though logically she knows that’s ridiculous.Ben hums quietly ""We’ll find them soon enough.” Leia hums, too, and casts her gaze over the stars. She asks, off-handedly, “Where are your family?”“Oh,” Ben waves his hands vaguely, keeping hold of the reigns, “gone now.”It sounds awfully lonely, and she tries to imagine not living with her parents. It’s not a very nice thing to imagine. “Do you miss them?” She asks.“Terribly,” Ben replies.Leia frowns. “I’m sorry.”“It’s quite alright, my dear,” says Ben, smiling. “It is the way of life, and certainly not your fault.”Leia hums, as if she understands. She doesn't, but her eyelids are beginning to feel heavy. The steady side-to-side rhythm of the eopie's gate tugs on the edge of Leia's consciousness as they fall into yet another silence. This time, she's doesn't think she has the energy to break it.It’s not an easy thing, to process so many shifts in one’s view of the universe all in one day. Leia has always been a quick learner, but unlearning, she thinks, is much harder. The desert’s lessons swirl inside her head like a sandstorm, and weigh in her heart like so many stars— none of them the one she calls home. The pinpricks of light scattered through Tatooine’s sky fade slowly as Leia’s eyes begin to close, and sleep wraps her in a warm embrace.

Chapter Text

Crosshair’s skin was burning. The snow pierced him harshly and stung his eyes. Somewhere in the storm his helmet came off.
 
Somewhere, out there in the wind and snow, there lay a flickering comm and broken visor.
 
There was a divot in the mountainside that was blocking the storm. It looked like it could barely fit a kid. It would have to do.
 
A groan from his side reminded him of his mission, and he readjusted his grip on Mayday’s barely-conscious body. He dragged his legs, heaving up his ankles just to dump them right back down, a mockery of walking.
 
They collapsed in their tiny so-called shelter, stopping to breathe. Mayday’s breathing was much more shallow. Shit. He probably had some fractured ribs from the hit against that boulder.
 
“Crosshair…”
 
“I’m here. We’ll just catch our breath, abd keep going—“
 
“No no, hang on. You hear that? Storm should pass in a bit.”
 
Crosshair looked up. The sky was still a blinding white, with no indication of up or down.
 
“Are you sure?”
 
“Which of us spent a year here, huh?”
 
“…Fine.”
 
The wind howled. It sounded like dying breaths.
 
Mayday chuckled. “You’re holding on really tight—“
 
“Apologies.”
 
Crosshair pulled his arms away, but Mayday soon caught his wrists.
 
“Hey. That wasn’t a complaint.”
 
“…It’s very cold.”
 
Mayday just laughed.
 
“Come here.”
 
Their arms became entangled, their breathing in sync. Mayday reached up and took off his helmet.
 
There he was.
 
Crosshair thought about the past few days. The way Mayday looked so much more rugged than other regs, how quickly and easily the banter started, the pressure mine, how he asked for Crosshair’s 

name

.
 
Crosshair didn’t remember the last time someone did that.
 
He didn’t remember if that happened before at all.
 
Mayday’s cheeks were rosy, but mostly covered up by his long beard.
 
Crosshair took a breath. “Look, we’ve only known each other for a very short while—“
 
Mayday shut him up with his lips.
 
Crosshair reached for Mayday’s face, grasping, desperately looking for… he didn’t know what. But Mayday seemed to, because he cradled him even closer.
 
“These missions get so lonely…”
 
“I know, I know.”
 
They looked at each other. They looked 

into

 each other.
 
A few hours later, Mayday was right. The snow was still coming down, but not as harshly.

Chapter Text

“Tech.”


Tachycardia is a symptom that may be caused by anger, anxiety, excessive caffeine intake, and love.


“Tech!”

Tech looked up from his datapad to see Echo waving his hand in front of him. “Yes, Echo?”

“It’s my turn to pilot the ship.” Echo looked at Tech with a brow raised. “Is everything alright?”

“Yes, I was merely focused on my reading.”

“What’re you reading?” Echo sat down in the co-pilot seat.

“I am researching conditions that cause tachycardia,” the younger clone replied, adjusting his goggles.

“Why would you be doing that?”

“I have been experiencing the symptom irregularly for the past three standard rotations.”

Huh,” Echo said. “Could it just be nerves?”

“Unlikely. I have been on much harder missions than this without any symptoms.”

“Have you been taking energy stimulants?”

“Not since Cross took the last one in our supply. However, that was before my tachycardia began.”

“Do you have any other symptoms?”

“I’ve also experienced acute hyperhidrosis on the palms of my hands.”

“Racing heart and sweaty palms…” Echo repeated, seemingly thinking to himself as he rested his chin in his hand.

Tech stared at his brother. If he couldn’t figure out what was wrong by himself, then how could Echo? Tech was going to tell him that it wasn’t a big deal, and that he didn’t need to think about it when Echo spoke.

“Is there a pattern to the symptoms?”

Tech thought. It began three rotations ago when they began assisting another clone battalion and their Jedi general, Vasma Pavak. Clone Force 99 didn’t get along with the regs, but General Pavak had been kind and welcoming. She was younger than most Jedi generals he met, being around the same physical age as the clones. She was also the first Pantoran Jedi he had met. Tech remembered the way she looked as she held her hand out to him after he had been knocked down by a blaster shot from a commando droid. A stray lock of purple hair had fallen from her braid as she leaned over him.

“Tech?” Echo asked, pulling him back to the present.

“Sorry, what was the question again?” Tech said as he studied Echo’s face. He looked amused. 

“Nevermind that question. What were you just thinking about?”

“I was recalling the moment General Pavak assisted me when I got hit in the command center.” Tech wondered why that was important to figuring out what was wrong with himself.

“I think I’ve figured it out. You have a crush on the general,” Echo stated.

“What do you mean?”

“A crush is when you like someone in a romantic way.”

“I know what a crush is. But how did you come to that conclusion?” Tech didn’t understand his brother’s logic.

“It’s simple, really. You had a racing heart and sweaty palms, both signs of nervousness, and when I asked when those happened you thought about her. You were also blushing.”

“But it’s illogical, having a crush on a Jedi.”

“How so?”

“Their tenets state that they cannot have attachments, so forming an attachment to one would be unwise.”

“Unwise, yes. But love doesn’t usually care about logic.”

The two of them sat in silence for a few more minutes before Echo spoke again.

“You should go to sleep, it’s my watch now.”

Tech stood and made his way to the bunks. He thought about what Echo had said regarding love. But this wasn’t love, it was just a crush. There was a high chance he would never see her again. The feelings would fade, and Tech would be back to normal.

***

Tech did, in fact, go back to normal. He didn't think often of General Pavak until order 66 was issued, and then it was only briefly. 

Omega joined them. Crosshair left and returned. Tech continued on as he always had with his squad. Until one day when they all returned from a job for Cid.

“Hunter, can Wrecker and I get some Mantell Mix?” Omega asked as they exited the Marauder.

Hunter gave Omega some credits before the two loudest members of the batch ran off towards the marketplace. The rest of the team made their way to Cid’s parlor.

“What took you so long?” Cid asked as the group walked in.

“We had some complications with our ship,” Tech replied.

“Whatever,” Cid said, waving a hand. “What information did you get?”

Echo told Cid about the intel they gathered as the other three sat at the bar. Hunter placed his head in his hands, no doubt nursing a sensory overload. Crosshair pulled out a pack of toothpicks and stuck one in his mouth. Tech took out his datapad and began researching the parts they would need to find to fix the Marauder. Soon Wrecker and Omega returned with a carton of Mantell Mix each.

“Do you want some, Tech?” Omega asked, holding out her carton to him.

“No thank you,” he replied, “excessive sugar intake can lead to various health conditions such as—”

“We know, Tech!” Wrecker complained.

“Wrecker…” Hunter warned.

“Sorry,” Wrecker whispered loudly.

Echo finished his report to Cid, and sat down beside Tech. “We’ve got eyes on us. Hooded figure, corner booth.”

“Cid?” Tech said.

“Yeah, Goggles?”

“The person in the corner booth has been watching us. Do you know them?”

“Yeah, she does some odd jobs for me. I trust her,” Cid said before walking away, ending the short conversation.

Tech turned to look at the stranger. She quickly looked down at her drink before downing the rest of it. As she raised her head, Tech noticed her blue skin. She was either Pantoran or Chiss. Pantoran was more probable.

Tech felt something strange in his stomach. It was as if he knew this woman. He tried to get a better look at her face, but the hood she wore made it impossible.

***

Vasma closed her eyes and reached into the force. She could feel their presences. Two were joyful, they must have been Wrecker and the young girl with them. One was in immense pain, which she assumed was Hunter. Two more felt wary. Vasma couldn’t tell which ones they were, but she guessed they had noticed her. She couldn’t place the feeling of the last one. It felt like a mix of apprehension and excitement, as if he was confused.

Vasma opened her eyes. Tech was still staring at her. She stood and walked toward them. The other four men turned to her as she approached. Wrecker had stepped in front of the child. Removing her hood, she heard a small gasp from Tech. All their eyes widened, except for Crosshair, who squinted.

“General Pavak,” Echo said with something similar to awe in his voice. He raised his scomp arm in a salute.

“There’s no need for that, Echo,” Vasma said, a bittersweet smile coming to her face.

“How are you alive? We have not met many jedi who survived order 66,” Tech asked, adjusting his goggles.

“I would rather not speak of it,” she replied, “it is not a happy memory for me.”

“Hello,” the young girl said, stepping around Wrecker and waving. “My name is Omega.”

Vasma crouched down and smiled. “Hello Omega, my name is Vasma.” Vasma looked back up to the clones questioning why they had Omega with them.

“She is also a clone,” Tech explained, “a pure genetic replica of our donor.”

“Fascinating,” Vasma said, turning back to Omega. “Would you like to play a game of dejarik?”

Omega smiled. “Yes!”

Vasma had planned on going easy on the girl but abandoned that plan after her second move. Omega was good.

“I would not move there,” Tech said from over Vasma’s shoulder. He was watching them play and offering strategy help.

“I know what I’m doing, Tech,” Vasma said before moving her karkath and killing Omega’s monnok.

Omega immediately moved and attacked with her n'gok, killing Vasma’s karkath and winning the game. She pumped her fist in the air and high fived Wrecker. “You’re not as good as Hunter, but much better than Tech,” Omega said, turning back to her opponent.

Vasma laughed. “Great game, Omega. I’ll win next time.”

“Unlikely,” Tech said. “Omega is our undefeated champion.” Vasma could hear some pride in his voice.

“It’s getting late, Omega,” Hunter said, standing up from his seat at the bar. “You need to go to sleep.” 

“Aw, Hunter,” Omega moaned. “Just one more game?”

“Omega…” Echo warned.

“Okay, fine,” she said, defeated. She looked back at Vasma. “It was nice to meet you.”

“You too, Omega.”

The girl stood and walked out of the parlor with Hunter.

Vasma turned her attention to the rest of them. “So how is it that you guys aren’t with the Empire?”

Echo, Wrecker, and Tech explained to Vasma about the inhibitor chips and their travels as Crosshair stayed silent, continuing to chew on his toothpick.

“...and we’ve been working for Cid ever since,” Echo said, finishing their story.

“How did you end up here, General?” Tech asked, adjusting his goggles again.

“Please, it’s just Vasma now,” she said before telling them how she came to Ord Mantell. “I’ll be here until it becomes too dangerous to stay,” she finished before taking a sip of her drink. 

“Let’s hope that’s a long way off,” Cid said, having listened in on the conversation. “Her expertise is invaluable.”

“And our’s isn’t?” Crosshair said, raising an eyebrow. It was the first time Vasma heard him speak that night.

“Keep your cool, Toothpick,” Cid shot back. “Your team has its perks too.”

Crosshair rolled his eyes, then stood and walked over to the dart board. Vasma watched as he got three bullseyes in a row.

Wrecker yawned and stretched his arms. “I’m heading back to the Marauder. It was good to see you again, Vasma.” 

Wrecker was followed by Echo. He echoed Wrecker’s sentiments and squeezed Tech’s shoulder before leaving.

A companionable silence fell over Vasma and Tech. He read something on his datapad while she watched Crosshair shoot darts. Eventually Crosshair left, and she turned her attention to Tech. 

Not that she would tell anyone, but Tech had been her favorite of the squad when she met them during the war. His hair was longer now, but not messy. It was somewhat wavy and had been combed back. It looked cute. A stray piece fell in front of his face, and he tried to blow it out of the way. Vasma let out a quiet laugh. 

“What is it?” Tech asked, looking up from his datapad to her.

“Let me,” Vasma said before stretching out her hand to tuck the offending piece of hair with the rest of it.

***

Tech was experiencing tachycardia again. He had been all night since Vasma revealed herself. But now his heart quickened even more. He had told himself that he should leave when Crosshair did, but his body had refused to comply when the time came, and now this was happening.

“You okay there, Tech?” Vasma said, pulling Tech out of his thoughts.

“Yes, I am adequate.” Tech was not feeling adequate, but he wasn’t going to let her know that she had metaphorically short circuited his brain and heart with a small touch to his hair.

“What were you looking at on your datapad?”

“I was looking up parts for our ship. It sustained some damage on our most recent job. Do you happen to know where I can get a stabilizing coil?”

“Can’t say I do. But I can look around,” Vasma said with a small smile that made Tech’s stomach flip.

He began listing the other parts that would be required for the repairs to the Marauder, pausing when she asked questions about some of the parts.

“I would love to keep talking with you, Tech,” Vasma started, “but I’m starting to fall asleep. Do you mind waiting until tomorrow to continue?” She punctuated it with a yawn.

“Of course. Sleep is an essential part of remaining healthy.”

“Thanks, Tech,” she said with a small laugh. “It’s been good to see you again.” She gave him a quick side hug. “See you tomorrow.”

Tech watched her as she walked out of the parlor. He didn’t know how long he had sat there watching the door, when Cid came up to him from the other side of the counter.

“Hey, Goggles. Get out of here, I’m closing up for the night.”

Tech picked up his datapad and left while thinking about his predicament. He was quickly falling for the Jedi but knew that she couldn’t have feelings for him. The more time he spent with her the stronger his feelings would get. But she was also one of the first people that took a genuine interest in his ramblings. 

He arrived at the Marauder and entered the cockpit. Surprisingly, Echo was still awake.

“How was your date?” Echo asked nonchalantly.

“What do you mean?”

“You were at Cid’s parlor for at least two hours after Cross came back. I assume Vasma was the reason?”

“We just talked. It wasn’t a date, and even if I wanted it to be, she’s a jedi.”

“And your point is?”

“Jedi cannot have attachments, you know this.”

“When I was back with the 501st there was a rumor going around about General Skywalker.”

“What does that have to do with my situation?”

“The rumor,” Echo continued, “was that he was in love with Senator Amidala. That they were in a relationship even.”

It was Tech’s turn to ask what the point was.

“The point is that not all jedi strictly follow their code.”

“Regardless, it is highly improbable that she would like me in the same way I like her.”

“I don’t think so,” Echo said with a yawn. “I’m heading to bed, don’t stay up too late.” He patted Tech on the shoulder, then left the cockpit.

Tech sat thinking about his quandary for some time before drifting off to sleep."

Chapter Text
Ahsoka corrió con todas sus fuerzas, sus ojos fijos en el ala Y piloteada por Rex mientras el Venator se desbarataba, sintió el aire cortante sobre su rostro por la velocidad de la caída en picada, brinco cuando llegó a uno de los cañones y se adelantó cuando el ala Y tenía que maniobrar entre los escombros,  desde la escotilla abierta del Venato Rex extendió su mano enguantada mientras que con la otra sujetaba los controles, Ahsoka recurrió a la fuerza cuando se estaba quedando por detrás acelerando sus zancadas, con la mano estirada deseo ser un poco más veloz para alcanzar la de Rex el tiempo se acaba estaban cerca del choque, con la adrenalina al máximo Ahsoka casi pudo olvidar cómo había terminado en aquella situación, aunque no del todo, en una parte de su mente zumbaba la realidad de lo que los había llevado hasta ese punto y de la inevitabilidad de lo que ocurriría cuando el Venator colasionara, Ahsoka brinco otro cañón, el ala Y no podía acercarse más, Ahsoka se encontró con la mirada preocupada y urgente de Rex y entonces ella saltó…Cayó..Sus dedos rozaron los de Rex por un breve segundo, antes de no sentir nada muestras caía al vacío, su mirada se encontró con la de Rex por última vez mientras un grito ahogado salió de sus labios mientras se aproximaban a lo que esperaba fuera final...La caída se prolongó mientras todo se oscureció …Y entonces…Despertó…Y gritó… Ahsoka se levantó de golpe de lo que parecía una litera… el corazón latía sin parar en su pecho,
— Rex — murmuró.Tal vez al final Rex había hecho una tonta maniobra para salvarla cuando caía en picada a la inconsciencia…
Por instinto intentó ponerse en pie mirando en todas direcciones, Rex no la habría abandonado… a menos que hubiera encontrado un lugar seguro cosa que dudaba, n un movimiento automático llevó sus manos a sus caderas dónde descansaban sus sables de luz, una nueva ola de terror la inundó cuando no los encontróUna mano en su hombro la sobresaltó, empujando con la fuerza a una niña tholoriana hacía una pared, Ahsoka lo lamentó cuando la niña se echó a llorar, una niña y un niño humano se acercaron al instante — ¿Estás bien? — le preguntó la humana a la otra chica mientras el pequeño humano que no podía tener más de 8 años la fulminaba con la mirada, Ahsoka no respondió, necesitaba orientarse, con poca dificultad se sentó en la litera observando su entorno con atención, ignorando deliberadamente a los niños por el momento, después de todo no podía tranquilizarlo si ella estaba al borde de otro colapso,se enfocó en la habitación, parecía una habitación regular, desprovista de artículos… las similitudes a sus cuartos en el templo jedi eran desconcertantes, encontrarse en el templo era una opción poco fiable, aunque Rex la hubiera podido llevar a algún lugar seguro desde el  desastre en el Venator definitivamente no sería al templo, Rex le había dicho que la orden se había extendido entre todo el ejército, si eso era cierto Ahsoka no podía pensar en un peor lugar, los clones de la 332 habían perdido todo rastro de identidad, no había amistad, no tenían dudas, habían ido directo a matarla a ella y a Rex, el templo no podía ser seguro, miles de dudas comenzaron a juntarse en su mente… ¿Los clones irían tras el templo?, ¿casarían a todos los jedi?, ¿Matarían a los niños? Ahsoka no quería pensar en aquello, sintió el dolor de cabeza regresar junto con una sensación extraña de pánico y miedo filtrándose en la fuerza, lazos resquebrajándose, Ploo, Obi-Wan… Anakin…. los ojos de Ahsoka se ensancharon mientras crudas imágenes pasaron por sus ojos a una velocidad inhumana, Ayla siendo abatida en medio del familiar mundo de Felucia, un jedi cayendo desde un speeder tras ser disparado por sus tropas, una maestra Jedi luchando contra sus hombres en un planeta nevado mientras instaba a su padawan a correr, Obi-Wan cayendo de un acantilado tras la orden de Cody, las imágenes siguieron y siguieron y Ahsoka no pudo sentir más que temor y horror y finalmente Ahsoka vio el templo Jedi, invadido por fuerzas que estaban destinadas a ser amigos y que por una cruel conspiración ahora masacraban a todos a su alrededor, Ahsoka no quiso ver pero no podía dejar de ser una mera espectadora de la destrucción, Ahsoka sintió a la fuerza llorar y ella también quiso hacerlo cuando vio las familiares armaduras azules destrozándolo todo…Chillidos aterrados la sacaron de la pesadilla y Ahsoka abrió los ojos, a la puerta se hallaba una Jedi mayor que a Ahsoka le resultaba vagamente familiar, aferrados en sus brazos sostenía a dos niños más pequeños que chillaban y en sus piernas otros cuatro se arremolinaban en busca de consuelo, el niño de antes la miraba ceñudo aunque para Ahsoka era evidente el miedo en sus ojos, espera… ella los había asustado.— Tano… sígueme — masculló la maestra Jedi mientras hacía un esfuerzo para desprenderse de los niños a su alrededor, al niño humano le pasó uno de los jóvenes iniciados que parecía especialmente sensible y al otro lo depositó en el suelo con la niña tholoriana y la humana cuidando de él, él maestro claramente perturbado no espero una respuesta antes de salir de la habitación, la mente de Ahsoka daba vueltas dolorida y confusa y tras otra mirada del viejo Jedi procedió a bajar de la litera.— Ah — un grito se le escapó cuando sus piernas se tambalearon en el suelo, sin embargo el cruel tambaleo no eran la causa de su grito sino sus piernas demasiado cortas, Ahsoka frotó susojoscomo si se hallase borrosos para notar sus manos demasiado pequeñas, Ahsoka corrió al baño alcanzando el espejo con la necesidad de un banquito, aquel reflejo en definitiva no era lo que esperaba, sus lekkus y montrals antes largos y definidos eran ahora incluso más pequeños que cuando había entrado a la guerra, su rostro ahora era más redondo y sus marcas no parecían más que rayas en su cara sin una definición que venía con la edad, Ahsoka tocó su rostro espantada pasando a pellizcarse un brazo, esto seguro era un sueño o una pesadilla, tal vez esto era lo que se referían los no sensibles como ver tu vida entera cuando estás apunto de morir o quizás esto era la ¿fuerza?, Ella de verdad había muerto… de alguna forma Ahsoka lo prefería antes que vivir con el peso de toda la 332 y la galaxia sobre sus hombros, solo lamentaba no haberse despedido de Rex ….— ¡Tano! — la maestra que había estado en la entrada se acercó hasta ella mientras la ayudaba a bajar del banquito — ¡estás proyectando!, has despertado a todos los iniciados y los padawans menos protegidos — le regaño la JediAhsoka palideció, ¿había proyectado todo aquel sufrimiento?, No podía culpar a ningún iniciado por perder el control, pero esperaba ¿Cómo podía proyectar si ni siquiera era real todo aquello?, Las dudas vinieron nuevamente junto con el miedo y la intriga — suficiente— espetó la maestra, Ahsoka entonces notó su extraña incapacidad de mantener sus emociones para sí misma — vamos a ver a los sanadores — añadió llevándola del hombro, Ahsoka reconoció nuevamente la extrañeza de todo cuando notó que al maestro jedi apenas le llegaba a la cintura.Ahsoka se aferró a sus emociones intentando contenerse mientras las miradas asustadas y llorosas la seguían mientras otros caballeros y maestros se esforzaban por controlar la situación, Ahsoka estuvo apunto de perder el control de nuevo cuando una niña miriliana la miró con curiosidad a través de una puerta, las marcas en su rostro la hacían inconfundible a pesar de la diferencia de edad <> Ahsoka pensó cuando subió a un elevador.El viaje por el templo fue silencioso mientras Ahsoka hacía un gran esfuerzo para no llorar ante el horror que a ratos se presentaba ante sus ojos, los hombres de la 501,sus hombres, sus amigos… hermanos jamás harían algo como aquello,,el templo parecía lleno de fantasmas mientras caminaban en los pasillos escasamente iluminados y Ahsoka no podía evitar la inquietante sensación de que algo en las visiones se le escapa a, bueno,no era como que nada más se le escapara…Después de lo que pareció una eternidad finalmente llegaron a la sala de los curanderos, la sala se hallaba vacía salvó por algún Jedi que seguro había adquirido alguna enfermedad de algún mundo en el que había estado, todo lo contrario a los días de la guerra en los que la sala de los curanderos y los tanques de bacta estaban llenos de Jedi moribundos por heridas de guerra,está sala se parecía más bien a su infancia cuando había paz… Ahsoka se detuvo en el pensamiento, esto no podía ser su infancia, cierto que era mucho más joven y ahora que ponía en marcha su memoria quizás podía recordar a aquellos niños asustados como sus compañeros de guardería y el maestro Jedi podía pasar bastante bien por uno de sus maestros de guardería, pero .. la sola idea era imposible y descabellada, no Ahsoka no podía perder la cabeza, tal vez Rex si la había salvado, solo para ser capturados por los Sith desconocidos, esto debería tratarse de un retorcido plan de los Sith para engañarla y registrarse en su locura, pero por ¿qué?, Una ex padawan no podía ser tan importante, tal vez si si era para llegar a Anakin u Obi-Wan o el maestro Ploo, pero ella los había sentido morir… o no…. La cabeza de Ahsoka estaba a punto de explotar, tal vez esto se debía a algún castigo de la fuerza por haber abandonado su camino cuando dejó a los Jedi… como sea todo aquello era mejor que pensar que finalmente se había vuelto loca.Una maestra Che que parecía un caballero la examinó mientras Ahsoka trataba de enfocar sus pensamientos, las olas calmantes del maestro Che hacían poco para aliviar la ansiedad que la tenía sujeta, Ahsoka se esforzó por aferrarse a sí misma sus preocupaciones y temores no necesitaba que un grupo de maestros que podía o no podría está ahí la tacharan como loca.— Tano parece visiblemente perturbada, no puedo decir con certeza pero parece haber recibido un evento traumático, lo que podría haber desencantado el temor y la explosión de su poder así como la pérdida del control — dijo la maestra Che tras ofrecer a Ahsoka unas palmaditas que no sirvieron para reconfortará, aún así Ahsoka los eligió ignorar echándose sobre la blanda litera— el maestro Ploo lo mencionó alguna vez…. Cuando la encontró casi se la habían llevado esclavistas — Murmuró la maestra Serrin que ahora volvía a la memoria de Ahsoka.
Ahsoka rodó los ojos ante los susurros de compasión, su ""experiencia""  había sido abrumada por ""experiencias"" reales, había sido esclavizada brevemente cuando intentaron liberar a su pueblo,había peleado con aprendices Sith y generales desquiciados con múltiples sables de luz, ya ha perdido cientos de hombres por sus decisiones apresuradas, había sido perseguida por trandoshanos para ser cazada como deporte, estuvo apunto de morir por un virus que se creía extinto y por supuesto había presenciado la pérdida de identidad de sus hombres mientras intentaba matarla, había visto los horrores de aquella orden y había sentido morir a sus amigos y posiblemente a toda la orden jedi, Ahsoka creía que esas están razones suficientes para estar perturbada como estaba sin contar que por alguna razón ahora parecía tener ocho años estándar….— Maestro Yoda — escucho a la maestra Che y a la maestra Serrin exclamar, Ahsoka se volteó en su litera fingiendo inconsciencia,si el maestro Yoda veía a través de ella no estaba segura lo que pasaría, <>, una voz fantasmal la llamó por su nombre, sus montrals se agudizaron solo levemente y con un ojo entre abierto Ahsoka notó un pájaro blanco con fragmentos verdes que le resultaron familiar, Ahsoka entonces lo supo… — Hija — Murmuró lo más silencioso que pudo, el ave pareció asentir levemente con la cabeza — esto es real?.... Realmente estoy de vuelta — preguntó entre murmullos esperando que los sensibles oídos del maestro Yoda no escucharán sus palabras.Antes que la Hija le diera una respuesta real el ave había desaparecido dejando a Ahsoka con una extraña sensación de tranquilidad mientras caía en la inconsciencia— lo decidiremos en la mañana, será mejor que vuelva a la guardería maestro tha — escucho murmurar al maestro Che, Serrin debió irse en silencio por qué Ahsoka no escucho una respuesta mientras sus ojos se cerraban— quedarme yo lo haré, vigilar sus sueños lo haré — murmuró Yoda, el sonido de un banquito chirrido y un crujido le siguió cuando Yoda se sentó — segura Ahsoka Tano sentirse debe — añadio, más pasos indicaron la salida del maestro Che y Ahsoka cerró los ojos— descansar debes … Padawan — fue lo último que Ahsoka proceso antes de quedarse profundamente dormida."

“How do you want it?” Satine combed her fingers through the long, glossy red hair, drawing the top half of it back as a sample of how it could look.“Cut it.”“Are you sure?” Satine’s hands lingered in place, eyes meeting her sister’s through the mirror.“Sure as fuck.”“Alright then.” Satine reached for the scissors, but before she could get them in her hand, Bo-Katan picked the vibro-knife from her boot and held its handle out to her.“Scissors would protect your hair, make the cut softer”, Satine said.“Do it.” Bo-Katan turned to look straight at her now, insistence burning in her eyes. And Satine knew that under that gaze, the only option was to yield. So she took the knife, pressed the vibration on and cut a chunk off the end of her sister’s hair, leaving it flowing down to the level of her shoulder blades.“Shorter”, Bo-Katan said.“But how do I braid your hair if it’s shorter than this?”“I want no fucking braids.”“Would be fit for a Princess, no?”“I’m no fucking Princess. You’re the Princess.”“Well, you’re my sister, and our Buir is Mand’alor. That makes you a Princess, too.”“Cut more.” Bo-Katan straightened her hand in the shape of a blade and brought it up to the level right under her ear to show how short she wanted it. With a sigh, Satine got back to work with the vibro-knife. It left behind a sharp line where the hair ended into nothingness over her neck, much crisper than mechanical scissors could ever cut.“Thanks.” Bo-Katan turned her head around to examine the result from different angles through the mirror, a pleased smile tugging the corner of her mouth.But Satine did not give her much time before she gestured Bo-Katan to stand up and started helping her into her armor. As she tightened the chestplate in place, Bo-Katan was painfully reminded that she should no longer put off going to the armorers and asking them to reforge it to make space for the breasts that were growing into it faster than she had bargained for. So far, she had still clung to a girl’s flat chestplate with all she had. Reforging it would mean accepting that her body had forever changed. She bit back a grunt as Satine proceeded to her backplate, then worked her way through Bo-Katan’s arms and legs.“Do you want to practice it one more time?” Satine asked.Bo-Katan rolled her eyes but recited in any case: “I swear on my name and the names of the Ancestors. That I shall walk the Way of the Mand'alor. And the words of the Creed shall be forever forged in my ass.”Satine dropped a vambrace she had been fastening when a giggle overtook her. She bumped her own armored shoulder into Bo-Katan’s pauldron as a half-hearted scolding.“Yeah, yeah, I know it"", Bo-Katan said. ""Every word. I’ve said it a thousand fucking times. I won’t embarrass you.”“Promise?”“Promise. Except…”“Except what?”“What if, right at that moment, I have to fart?”Satine laughed again and took a step back to examine the work she had just finished with the armor on her sister. “Hold it. It won’t take that long.”“What if I can’t hold it? Can I give you a sign and then you cough loudly at the same time to cover me up?”Satine sighed. “I made it through the whole thing without farting. And you know me. You will, too.”“But you are you”, Bo-Katan said more quietly and seriously. “You have a different face and a different ass for the public. And those are perfect. Not wild like you are at home. It’s like you can shift between two versions of yourself without missing a beat. Of me, there’s only one.”“And I love you for it.” Satine stepped closer again to stroke the unarmored patches on Bo-Katan’s arms. “And I also know that you’ll do great today.”When Bo-Katan still did not look convinced, Satine rolled her eyes and gave in: “Alright, if you really really need to fart, scratch your chin, and I promise to cough very loudly.”“Thank you."" Bo-Katan threw herself to hug her sister in an incoherent clash of beskar on beskar. - - - s - - - As she walked down the avenue leading through the Mines to the Waters, lined by thousands of spectators hanging reverently on her every step, it seemed that she was doing well with keeping her promise. She did not stumble but made the whole way gracefully in rhythm with the music.And once she reached the stairs leading into the Waters, her father and sister were standing right there next to them. They were both wearing their helmets, but Bo-Katan could easily imagine their expressions: Satine’s an encouraging smile, their a father’s more serious one, as usual in formal occasions. But if Bo-Katan could see his eyes, she was sure she would find that warm appreciation and love that was always there for her. Her father was like a mountain on the brink of her existence, always there, unquestioned.She took a deep breath before descending down the stairs. Once she was ankle-deep in the water, she turned around and waited still as an armorer followed her steps carrying her helmet, with the Kryze banner and the Mand’alor’s banner carried in tow. The music stopped and all was quiet, all eyes on Bo-Katan as she said:“I swear on my name and the names of the Ancestors. That I shall walk the Way of the Mand'alor. And the words of the Creed shall be forever forged in my a...” Shit. She had joked about this with Satine one too many times. There it was now, out of muscle memory, the wrong word almost out of her mouth. From the corner of her eye, she could see Satine’s shoulders quivering with held back laughter. Quickly, Bo-Katan swallowed, suppressed her own urge to chuckle and went on: “...heart. This is the Way.”Slowly, the armorer placed the helmet on Bo-Katan’s head, scooped water with a small bowl and poured it over the beskar covering her face. With that, she was finally done with the ceremony, ready to walk back under admiring gazes, all the way to the Grand Banquet Hall where a dinner in her honor was waiting.There were more courses and more gifts than she could ever imagine to truly enjoy, and her father even let her have a taste of tihaar for the first time. It made her face scrunch in disgust, but just the act of swallowing it anyway felt like another accomplishment for the day.Still, what probably felt the best was the moment after the banquet when she was pleasantly tired and about to retire to her quarters to sleep. Instead of saying his usual good night wish, her father hugged her, then looked deep into her eyes and said:“I was very proud of you today, Bo.”She smiled, wished him good night, just like every night, because without question, tomorrow was sure to become another normal day, the formalities of the ceremony forgotten and everyday life ready to go on. Little did she know that the next morning, she would find herself at the breakfast table alone with Satine and the service droid hustling around them. At first, they did not think much of it. Their father must be just sleeping in after the banquet. But as time went on, it felt too weird not to have him there, in his usual chair, one hand nursing a cup of caf and the other scrolling a datapad, familiar like gravity holding everyday life in place.“We should go check on him”, Satine said.“This is indeed highly irregular for Mand’alor…” the service droid started but Bo-Katan silenced it with two words:“We know.”With that, both sisters stood up and headed for their father’s quarters. After a knock on the door, they slid it open and entered into the still dim lighting with the blinders on the windows. As they opened the blinders and let the morning sun in, they found their father in bed, eyes wide open but not moving.“Buir?” Satine knelt by his bed, instinctively reaching her hand on his forehead to check for fever.“It’s ok.” He turned his head to look at Satine, but the movement made him wince in pain. “It’s just my back. I can’t move.”“I’ll get a cold pack.” Satine stood up, immediately on top of things.But Bo-Katan felt frozen in place. How was this even happening? Their father was invincible, unbreakable, unstoppable. Was this a dream where he was bound in bed with back pain? When would they wake up?Satine passed her on her way out of the room, and the flow of air following her felt very real, very unlike a dream. So Bo-Katan took a deep breath and tried to think straight.“I’ll get a bacta shot”, she said aloud.But before she could leave, her father’s voice stopped her: “No, Satine can get that, too. Bo, you come here.”On shaky legs, Bo-Katan walked up to the bed and sat on it, trying to angle herself so that her father could look at her while keeping his neck as straight as possible. Immediately, he grabbed her wrist and said:“This may be nothing serious. I might be well in a few hours, or a few days. But this won’t be the last time. I know it in my bones.”Bo-Katan blinked, striving to hold back tears. Her throat felt tight, unable to speak. And what would she have said anyway?  I don’t believe you. This isn’t true. You’re immortal. That’s what I know in my bones.He shook her wrist, forcing her to pay close attention to his next words: “Bo, before it’s too late, you have to challenge me for It.”His eyes flicked to the side and Bo-Katan followed their trail to his nightstand and the hilt of the Darksaber lying there, silent and menacing. It felt like the bed, the floor and the ground all gave way under her, when she realized what he was asking for.“No, no, Buir, I cannot kill you.”“You won’t kill me. You’ll give me a warrior’s death.”At that moment, those two seemed like exactly the same thing to Bo-Katan. She could no longer hold back a loose tear escaping the corner of her eye.“Our enemies don’t follow the Way"", he said. ""They’ll strike when I’m at my weakest, and the Saber and the rule of Mandalore will fall in the wrong hands. Promise me you won’t let it happen.”Regardless of what she had just sworn yesterday, she could not help herself saying: “We don’t have to follow the Way either. Satine is your rightful heiress. You can pass the throne to her like they do in other worlds where rule is inherited. She’d be a good Mand’alor.”He loosened his grip of his daughter’s wrist and caressed it more gently. “Satine would be good, that much is true. She’d be an excellent Queen for any other world. But Mandalorians only follow the strongest. No one can protect our people like you.”“But I don’t want to be Mand’alor.” Bo-Katan’s voice was already shaking with tears.“That’s exactly why you should. You’ll still have Satine by your side. She’ll help you with diplomacy and bureaucracy and politics and all that. Kryzes are stronger together. Just like all Mandalorians are stronger together. You’re the one who can unite them. But you have to promise to challenge me before I’m weak enough for an enemy to do it.”Bo-Katan stared at the Darksaber, imagining it in her own hands, black blade slashing through his father's body that used to be so immortal. The vision punched all air out of her lungs, leaving her empty and gasping for words that refused to take form.With a visible struggle, her father maneuvered his other arm over his blanket so that he could hold Bo-Katan’s hand with both of his own. His face softened as he said more tenderly: “Don’t worry about it yet. I’m not asking you to do it today. It wouldn’t be a fair fight, would it? It doesn’t even have to be this year. But you’ll know when it has to be. And when the time comes, you must not hesitate. This is the Way.”Bo-Katan used the back of her free hand to dry her tears. With all her willpower, she forced her eyes off the Darksaber and into meeting her father’s, as she echoed:“This is the Way.”"

Glowing letters stared at me as I wondered what had happened. I don’t exactly remember what happened to me; just a profound loss. It felt like an eternity had passed, with me staring into the white abyss with neon-colored words around me while trying to remember the last thing that happened before I ended up here. I sat down as I thought, and amusingly the words followed me so that it was still in view in front of me. Then, reaching out, I interacted with the words. Maybe this is like the VR games I tried before.[ X ] Yes

[Star Wars]
          ….What? Fuck, I don’t know my lore! I felt like tearing my hair out. Did I watch the movies? ….Maybe? Yes, yes, I did. Just not all the cartoon shows. Crap. What else did I watch? The Mandalorian and The Book of Bobba Fett. Now I remember. I watched The Mandalorian out of curiosity and fascination after the final face reveals in season 2. I didn’t even know who Pedro Pascal was until that episode. I was entranced enough that I ended up watching the BoBF when I found out Mando was in it and then the rest of the nine movies. I only watched the movies once, discounting the Prequels, which I vaguely remember watching at home as a kid. What else do I know? Wikipedia facts. I went down the Wiki tunnel for hours and emerged confused. And fanfics. A lot of smutty Mando fanfics. Fuck, I’m screwed. And not in a fun way.

Physical strength is not transferred to the real world from simulations, although muscle memory is. 

   

 [ ] (Perk) What’s That Over There!: Depending on your Charisma score, you can fool an enemy into looking in the direction you pointed, giving you and your possible allies a quick attack or escape. Minimum of 1 regardless of CHA score. 

    
[ ] (Disadvantage) Failed a Luck Check: You wake up in your new world under unfortunate circumstances and in a hostile environment. Nothing around you will be immediately lethal if you play your cards right, but you will in no way be considered safe.

 [ ] (Disadvantage) Headhunted: Every shadowy organization in the world wants a piece of you for one reason or another. They will never stop hunting you. Other organizations will only stop their pursuit if you are captured by one of them or become powerful enough to be untouchable.  
 
[ ] (Disadvantage) Like a Duckling: You imprint on the first person of authority you encounter in your new world. You are compelled to obey them but can resist their orders with effort. You are not compelled to remain around them and will not be compelled to obey any orders you are not present to witness. [ ] (Disadvantage) Who’s Your Daddy? (or Mommy?):   Uh oh, it looks like your father isn’t who you think he is. Taking this disadvantage means you inherit your father’s allies and enemies. You may also inherit the odd ability from your unknowing donor, such as artistic ability, or maybe you can burp really well. Unfortunately, that also translates to failing abilities as well. Baldness could be a family trait! The only catch is that you have to find them first. What will the draw be? Hero or Villain? Or some boring nobody? I looked at my options. All right, let’s do this![ X ] Linguist [ X ] Incognito[ X ] Runscript[ X ] Failed a Luck Check[ X ] Regression[ X ] Who’s Your Daddy? (or Mommy?)Oh god, I hope I’m still human. I didn’t want to be related to any of the main people in Star Wars, but I rather not be headhunted or a duckling. These perks were fantastic, and Linguist is a must. No more language classes to suffer through. This would help immensely. No more stumbling over my words while learning because of Apraxia!
Who’s Your Daddy? (or Mommy?): Race Selection
I was stunned as a wheel flashed before me, displaying many different racial beings in the Star Wars Galaxy. Although I was looking at the options, I noticed that there were two arrows like on a clock. Is that for my parents? I thought it was only one of them. Shit, am I going to be some hybrid with medical issues? I touched the glowing wheel, and it began to spin.Round and round, the arrows spun before they began to slow.
Stewjon – Mother, below average Force Sensitivity 

[……] – Father, Non-Force Sensitive
What the hell is Stewjon? It doesn’t even tell me, my dad! I despaired. Am I human or not?! I just want to know if I don’t have to lay eggs or something.

[ ] Yes [ ] No
Tsk, why not. Let’s get this show on the road. I’m still mad I didn’t get an answer to that human question.[ X ] Yes

Chapter 2: You like sand?!
It was hard to open my eyes at first, but when I did, I saw the metal bars around me and the rusted walls of the room with different cages around me.
The fuck?
I am in a cage. Ooh, I’m pissed. Where am I? Wait, where’s my Menu?

Let’s see, what is Karmic Windfall?[ X ] Karmic WindfallMany, many generations ago, an ancestor of yours unknowingly encountered a god. Due to an act of true unselfishness, that ancestor gained the favor of the young Luck Karma Goddess that passed onto you during your past life. With the blessing of that goddess, you now carry a variation of that blessing today in your current incarnation. (She’s sad to see you gone, you’ve been a favorite of hers in recent times)
People like you, for the better or worse. Females in your family will gain a lucky windfall. To a lesser extent, males as well. Money, objects, or an unexpected chance will pass from time to time. 

Acts of goodwill fill the Karmic meter, and immoral acts decrease it. Once filled, you have a choice to use that lucky chance to help you on your adventure randomly. 

Conditions* Naming conditions follow a pattern for each generation of blessed. Even numbers are preferred as opposed to odds. The trait of a beauty mark given to her blessed signifies that this mortal was given a divine blessing.  
I stared at the screen incredulously. A goddess!? I guess that explains the strange bouts of luck in my life. But, I wonder if this new chance at life was her doing as well. Is that why my mom gave all of us S names, and we have the same dot under our eyes?!Not knowing what to do. I sent a small prayer and thanks to the unknown goddess. Maybe it would reach her from this Universe.With that out of the way, I browsed the other options. Again, the quest log seemed self-explanatory.      [ X ] Stats

Well. That’s going to be heavily abused. I have several new abilities that I just got that need to be trained. Grinding, yay. Hopefully, it would be more fun than me grinding my starter Pokemon and whatever I caught to level 15 before the first gym.[ X ] Party
Form parties with your allies and take on dungeons that will show up on the map when you activate the party function. Permanent and Temporary Parties will be available to create after you leave the Prologue area.

What? Wait, is me being kidnapped the freaking Prologue? I’m getting vague notions of Skyrim.[ X ] Quest logA holographic journal appeared in front of me with my new name on the front. I gave it an annoyed glare.
Prologue 

A young girl name Xai-Wan Kenobi is the miniature protagonist of this adventure. She grew up on the planet of Stewjon with her mother in her short life. Unlike most of the Stewjoni, Xai-Wan exhibited force powers and was given the title of Kenobi. Child of the Stars. Before being given to the Jedi, she was taken from her home and shoved into an unfamiliar environment.

Ongoing Quests: None
Right, unfamiliar. More like I’m in a cage with slavers. It seems I’m the only one in this tetanus filth around me. Isn’t that what was popular with Star Wars? The mental picture of the Slave outfit Leia comes to mind.
Observation! Your eyesight is better than it was in your past life. You got good genes. Congratulations! You don’t need glasses like a blind bat anymore! 50 exp.
Wow, you don’t have to be so rude. I closed my journal when I saw nothing else in it, and it disappeared.Though the Kenobi last name makes sense now. The people of Stewjon must give it to Force-Sensitive kids before they’re given to the Jedi. That still doesn’t answer who my parents are.Alright, time to grind. Nothing was happening besides the normal sounds in this ship(?). Spaceship! Spaceship! I sighed as my inner kid with ADHD kicked in.[ X] RunscriptThe double vision was initially disorienting, but I got used to it. I trained my Apparition abilities until I could safely travel from one end to the other end of the room. In the mental simulation, I watched one guy rush in from somewhere else due to the loud displacement of me popping everywhere. I got freaked out by the lizard person subduing my practice self before I redid the run.I tried to improve my Apparition to get it to go quieter. It didn’t do anything, but I did get quicker at it. And I might be imagining it, but maybe it was quieter? It also reached the point that I wasn’t splinching myself, which satisfied me. Now, what about my powers? Electromagnetism Manipulation: StaticI amused myself by practicing my electricity on the lizard guy. Maybe I should call him a Vesk from Starfinder? My puny powers started as static electricity at first. Other me got slapped around the first couple of times before I could make an arc of lighting jump from my hands to 5ft in front of me to the guard. It seemed to stun them for a few moments until I could give him severe burns. With the increased control, I could tell he had some electronics on him without searching. I looked around my cage and saw it had an electronic lock. It was unlocked easily, with me scrambling the locking mechanism.
Technology Manipulation locked until level 3
Damn, I guess I can’t fly a ship yet. I stood there for a while before something new popped up for me.

I snorted at that line. Whoever is the Monitor of this game has a sense of humor. I gained a WIS point. At least they didn’t seem to stop me from grinding. How much time did I spend doing that anyway?
12 hours. Save Menu has a daily limitation of what a Player can do while Paused from reality. Twenty-four hours is the limit one can be in during New Game+. This does not count towards Dungeon Crawling. Different time constraints are used in this function and can be randomized. 
Hmm. I just got an answer. I wonder if it's only in the Prologue/Tutorial. Yes. … Okay, then. Well, I got 12 hours left. It would likely take me longer than 12 hours to get to Level 3. Let’s save that for later.I exited Runscript to observe my prison. I was already bored out of my mind, and it hadn’t even been a minute. I leaned back to my cage and noticed stats in the bottom corner of my eye.Like the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Heart games, an HP, FP, and my Karmic meter stood out to me. I guess FP means Force Points? Power?
[X] Force Abilities
An ability tree stood out to me, reminding me of something. Oh. My eyes widened as  I realized it looked like the Sphere Grid and the Ability Tree from Final Fantasy X and Star Wars Fallen Order. Now, what do I have?
Force Push

Force Pull

Force Suggestion* 

*Use this skill with caution. Should an immoral suggestion be made, your Karmic Meter is affected. Should your Karma Meter fill with bad Karma, the Karmic Windfall will activate with a Dark Side event occurring. The more Dark Side events that happen in your life, the closer your alignment to the Dark Side will happen until you reach Fallen status. Complete immersion of the Dark Side eliminates your Goddess Blessing with no chance of returning it. Only divine intervention can reverse it. But good luck with finding a God in this Universe.   
Ah, I exited my Menu again. Well, no cookies are good enough for that nonsense, then.The sound of the door opening had me turning toward the only exit where I saw the Vesk-like being that appeared in my Runscript holding something in his hand. Another Vesk was with him too.The first one walked over to me with an evil smirk before banging on my cage, causing me to flinch. Then, he shoved what looked like a ration bar and a weird pouch thing through the bars at me.“What an ugly kid. Do you think she’ll get us anything from Gardulla? I still say we should take her to the Hunting,” The first Vesk said to the other. I had a feeling he wasn’t talking about taking me to hunt deer.
 “Nah, we’re low on creditsss. We can find a Wookie or a Twi’lek later for the Hunt. Besides, we’re about to exit hyperspace over Tatooine. I bet she isn’t even a Jedi like we overheard those people at the Starport. It was trouble enough escaping that planet. Shame we couldn’t get the bitch with her. Now she would have got us rich with that bright red hair. We might get even with the repairs for the brat’s price.” 
My heart started racing as I heard the information. Was that my mother? Are they the ones that killed my mother? I looked at the “food” they gave me and looked at them with a wary look.“You hear that, brat? We’re gonna sell you for a lot of credits. I heard you, Stewjoni are worth a lot. Especially Redheads. Too bad you’re not one. We would have gotten top wupiupi for you.” The first green Vesk hissed at me.I glared at him.The second orange Vesk shoved him, “Dask, stop taunting her. Don’t forget she bites.”I noticed the green one had a bandage on one of his four talons. I grinned at him nastily. Dask hissed in rage, reaching for his blaster before he was pulled out by the orange one whose gauntlet thing started beeping.“We’re exiting hyperspace now. Let’s go.” He grunted at his partner. Dask gave me an ugly look before leaving with him.I stuck out my tongue at his back. Time to plan my escape.[ X ] RunscriptI used up the rest of my hours in Runscript, but I’m sure I have it. It took me 25 tries and a lot of cursing before I got a workable strategy. Unfortunately, it looks like I will have my first starship crash and kill my first baddies. I frowned. I didn’t like the thought of these idiots being my first official kill, but I rather not be a slave to whoever this Gardulla was. And maybe avenge my mother or whoever had me at Stewjon.I felt the ship do a weird shift and wonder if that feeling was us leaving hyperspace. I held my hand to the lock and scrambled it. It clicked open, and I crawled out. Honestly, these heathens couldn’t even give me a bigger cage. I patted my clothes as I walked over to the door.
Quest: Escape to Freedom!

 Hurry and escape before time runs out and you’re a slave to the Hutt, Gardulla.  

 Reward: Freedom! Gain Tatooine Map Locations and unlock new quests. 

 Time limit: 10:00 minutes 
[ ] Accept [ ] DeclineNo doubt about that.[ X ] AcceptA direction meter appeared at the top of my view. Huh, that’s neat. It pointed at the door in front of me. I looked up at the button on the wall next to the door. It was high up there. I thrust my hand forward with a force push, and it clicked the door open. Success!I stealthily followed my compass to not the bridge but a closet. I opened it and realized it was a fucking armory. Well, not really, but it had a blaster I could use for my tiny (Cute!) hands. After grabbing it, my compass swung back to what I assumed was the bridge on this tiny ship.My stomach swooped as I felt the ship hit the atmosphere. Shit.
Time: 7:30 minutes
I made my way to the cockpit and saw the door was closed. With another Push, it opened for me, and both Vesks stared back at me dumbfounded. I quickly shot Dask in the head with grim satisfaction taking care not to miss, and hit the orange one in rapid succession. Blasters weren’t too different from Earth firearms. The recoil was almost nonexistent. I wondered if I could have gotten the Marksmanship Ribbon in Basic Training if I had used a blaster. I dismissed that thought.I pulled on their sleeves, and they fell out of their chairs. The ship was falling out of the guided path without a pilot. I climbed in the chair and pulled the yoke up. I was too short to sit in the chair and see out of the windshield. Standing in the seat, I looked out of the window and saw there was no city in view. I don’t have to worry about killing anyone else in my crash.The ground got closer to see, and I felt my heart racing. Here goes nothing. I yanked the yoke up higher and felt the ship level. A tingling feeling in my head directed my eyes to a couple of buttons. Hoping it was the Force directing me, I used Force Push on them in a seemingly random pattern and felt the ship falling slower as I got closer to Tatooine.I hope the sand will be soft. I squeeze my eyes and imagine a bubble of Force around me.
FP: 35/110
The ship crashed hard into the sand, and I was thrown around the room, but my shield saved me. I think I blacked out for a couple of minutes.When I woke up, it was quiet. The glass in front of me was caved, and sand was slowly filling the cockpit. Again, my Force Bubble saved me.
Quest Complete: Escape to Freedom!

Reward: Freedom! Tatooine Map unlocked. Access to new quests opened. 

Party System unlocked. 
Sweet. Better get out of the ship before Jawas appear. I looked at the lizard guys and noticed they were contorted, half buried in the sand.I raided their pockets and found gold coins and blue jelly discs. Is that Mon Calamari? The orange one had keys, and nothing else stood out to me but their weapons which I dismissed since they couldn’t fit my hands. Maybe to sell. I grabbed them both and ran out the back to see if I could grab food and more supplies.Poking around the crashed ship netted me more rations, water pouches, a knife, and some cloaks. Most likely for the sand. I looked at my pile of spoils before I realized something. I need to carry it all. Wait.[ X ] InventoryBlocks of empty spaces appeared in my Menu for items. I picked up my items and slipped them into the blocks. Sweet, I’m not going to be weighed down by supplies. I even put my new currency and weapons. Taking one last look, I cut one of the cloaks to my size and used the leftover cloth as a headscarf.Sniff. Ugh, that reeks like mothballs. Hopefully, it’ll air out. Time to get out of here.I walked out of the back of the ship that was luckily not buried in the sand. It took some doing, but I used Electricity Manipulation to open the ship doors. Unfortunately, it let out a horrifying shriek when it opened. Oops.Freedom.

Chapter 3: Save me from Blondes.
Twin binary stars shined down on the hot sandy earth of Tatooine. Huu. It’s hot.I looked at my Tatooine Map and saw that Mos Espa was closer than Mos Eisley, so I made my way there. Unfortunately, the twin suns were beating down on me, and I didn’t see any Jawas or Tuskens far as I could see. I hope I can reach town before I run out of water.The hydration water pouches were neat. I felt like I was drinking a Capri Sun, but it hydrated me more than any electrolytes drink I had. I did not drink too much, but I was running low. I was too short, and the distance I was going was slow.I saw an outcropping of rocks and thought to take a break there. Sweat was running down my face, and I wiped it off with the edge of my cloak. I really want a nap, but I knew it wouldn’t be safe for me out in the open like this.The suns were lowering, indicating close to evening hours. I hope I don’t hit a sandstorm here. Getting up, I started my walk again after checking my map. I was getting closer, thankfully. At the pace I was going, it looked like I’ll reach it at nighttime or early morning.Rumbling sounds passed by me, and I turned to look. A large, moving structure was coming towards me. Oh, look. Scavengers. They must have seen the crash. It surprisingly didn’t take long for them to see me, and the crawler stopped in front of me.Side panels popped open, and I heard the famous “Utinni!” I waved at them. One waved back before getting hit in the head by another. I laughed.The side door lowered down, and three Jawas walked down to me.
“Hey, look, they’re human.” 

“Nah, really? What made you think that?”
The middle Jawa didn’t join in the banter but spoke with me.“What are you doing here, child? Where is your family?” He poked at my cloak, and I poked back at him.“I don’t have anyone with me. I was going to Mos Espa, though. Can I get a ride?” All three of them jumped in shock at hearing Jawaese from me.“What do you got to trade? Just because you speak like us doesn't mean you get a discount.” The first Jawa pointed at me.I nodded my head in agreement. It was a fair point for them. “What if I tell you I know where a ship crash is that you can scavenge?”The three huddled in a circle and spoke amongst each other, completely forgetting that I could still hear them.The second Jawa said, “You’re going have to sweeten the deal before we take it.”I nodded in agreement, “How about I offer you a blaster with it?” The three of them huddle again, to my amusement.
“We’ll take it. But we’re going to the sight before returning to Mos Espa.”

Persuasion Check Success! 100 exp.
I held out my hand in agreement. That extra experience points landed me close to Level 3, which made me happy. Just 150 exp more. They gestured me inside, and I got to ride in the Sand Crawler. I looked around with a smile. The ceiling was just suitable for my petite size. Though, I was still smaller than the Jawas.“Utinni!” A happy cry came from my left, and I saw a Jawa my size. Kid Jawas!“I have never seen a human up close before.” The little one tugged my hand. I turned my head and looked at the three Jawas I walked in with.“The crash site is a couple of hours' walk that way.” I pointed back the way I came from. “It might be half buried now.” I heard more Jawas chime in before the little Jawa holding my hand tugged me over to more little ones playing marbles.Amusing myself, I played with them as the Sand Crawler returned to the Vesks’ ship. I eventually fell asleep in a cuddle pile of Jawas. Most of them were piled on me, but I slept like the dead. It was well into the night before we reached the site, and by the time I woke up, I saw that the ship was picked clean of usable parts.
Game Save!

Climbing out of the pile, I walked outside to what I’m sure was one of the Jawas that spoke to me. “Good haul?” I pulled out a ration from my inventory to eat.
“Very good. You held up your end of the deal and even spent time with the little ones. We’ll take you to Mos Espa after we’re done.”
I yawn and nod my head again. I went back to the baby Jawas and got back in a pile to sleep. I woke up again and felt that the crawler was moving. New junk was in the open spaces, and fewer babies were around me.Laying on the ground, I looked at my sleeping companions and started to poke one awake. I quickly closed my eyes as they woke up. The little Jawa mumbled and flopped on me. OoofI patted their backs and let them lay on me. It made me miss my nephews. I sigh. I almost went back to sleep to the crawler rumbling underneath me when I felt it slow down.I saw the same Jawa before coming down from a higher level.
“You’re awake. We’re outside the city limits. Be careful in the city. Some slavers wouldn’t mind taking little ones like you.”

“Thank you for your advice. Are there any specific areas I should watch for?”
The Jawa thought for a moment. “The slugs’ men like to roam the main streets. If you’re going there, be sure to cover your hair.” He leaned in and tugged some of my hair that had fallen out of my headscarf in my sleep.I blinked and noticed my hair for the first time. I thought my hair was the same dark brown and black as in my past life, but now under Tatooine's twin suns, it had lightened to a reddish brown. Did the sun bleach my hair?I got up and laid the baby back down with the other one. Unwrapping my hair, I redid my hair in a messy bun and rewrapped the cloth around my head again. I made sure to tuck in the stray strands from view. As I was redoing my look, I looked up and saw the Jawa had a cloak my size held out for me. It was the same brown color as the Jawas clothes I had seen around me.“Thank you.” He nodded to me and helped me up. I “reached” behind me like I had a back holster, pulled out one of the blasters from my inventory with a couple of rations, and handed it to him.He nodded, satisfied at the fair trade for the cloak, and pointed to one of the Jawas by the door. I tugged off my Vesk cloak and pulled the Jawa one over my head. It fits perfectly.
Barter Success! 25 exp.
After business, I left the nice Jawas’ Sand Crawler and made my way into Mos Espa. The door closed behind me, and the crawler returned the way we came.It was early morning by the time I reached the open gates. No one was in sight before I got a notification on my compass. Intrigued, I Paused and looked at my Tatooine map. {Potential Ally} was marked on the map.I grinned and made my way to the marker. It didn’t take me long to find it was a junk landfill of parts and trash. Coming closer, I browsed the junk and jumped when someone patted my shoulder.“Hi! I have never seen you here before.” I looked over and saw it was a blond boy in a grey shirt and tan pants. It was Anakin Skywalker. He looked like he did in the Phantom Menace, if not a year or so younger.I blinked at him and pointed, “I crashed way over there. Some Jawas brought me here because I asked them.”“You were in the ship that crashed yesterday?! Where are you from? Don’t you have more people with you? You’re a little short to be by yourself.” The older blonde spat out these questions in rapid succession.My eyebrow ticked at the short comment.“Yes, I was on that ship. I’m from another planet you never heard of. But, no, I don’t have more people with me. They’re dead. And you’re short too.”He looked stunned before he replied indignantly, “No, you’re short!”“Nah, you are.” He huffed and tried to tower over me in his 4’5” height with hands on his hips. I smirked at him and poked him in the stomach to make him bend to my 3 feet self.He jabbed me back in retaliation. I moved to dodge and said while running, “You’re it!”“What!?” He ran after me, and we ran around junk piles for a few minutes.“You’re it!” He slammed into me, and we crashed into the sand. We laughed like hyenas as we lay in the sand. Then, after a few moments of trying to calm ourselves, Anakin startles back into a sitting position.“Oh no! I was going to see if I could find parts for my pod racer. But, drat. I have to go to Watto’s shop soon.” His upset face made me sad, and I bit my lip.“What do they look like? Maybe I can find them for you.” He lit up at my offer, put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out a list.“They look like these! Here! I have to go. Thanks!” I sat there as the hyperactive 8-year-old left four-year-old me in the sand with a fucking Honey do-list in my hand.

Nice. That’ll be something I practice when I get the chance.Looking at my compass, I saw only two markers left. I sighed to myself and walked over to the parts. And… they’re buried in the sand. I picked up my makeshift shovel and got to work. This was a digging quest.By the time mid-afternoon hit around, I had found my last part. As I was digging, I also found gold coins in different areas. They were wupiupi coins which made my stash a little bit bigger. It hit home that this was like an actual game to me. I was finding money like Link killing grass.I scoured the area for more money and different parts that seemed to glow for me. Unfortunately, they weren’t on the list, but I put them in my inventory.I hid now and then when I saw the residents of Mos Espa. All of them looked sketchy, so I kept away from them.When I laid my hand on the last item, I got a notification from the Quest Log. 
Major Quest Update: Pod Racer Builder - Meet up with Anakin
I guessed I played enough in the sand. Dropping my shovel, I made my way to the path Anakin took. Just in time, I saw him walking out of a shop. Most likely Watto’s.His face lit up when he saw me again. It made me want to pinch his freckled cheeks. Then, he rushed over to me.“Did you get anything!?”“Yea-” My stomach grumbled loudly.Anakin giggled at me and tugged me to follow him. The streets got increasingly crowded as we took turns here and there before reaching what I assume was the slave district from the movie.He stopped at one door in particular and pulled me in.“Mom! I’m home, and I brought a friend!” I saw Shmi Skywalker from the other side of the room, watching a pot and sewing clothes. “She’s helping me with my pod racer. We came home because she’s hungry.”“Ani!” She smiled her motherly smile at the both of us. “Hello, what’s your name?”“Um.” I stopped for a second. I almost said my past-life name. “It’s Xai-Wan.” I felt better not saying Kenobi. I don’t know if anyone on Tatooine knows about the Stewjoni traditions.“Mom, Xai-Wan was on the ship that crashed yesterday. She doesn’t have anyone with her. Can she stay with us?” Anakin tugged me over to sit at the table and started setting plates for dinner.Shmi looked shocked before wiping her face off it. “Of course, she can. It’ll be hard, though. Watto only gives us enough money for food, Anakin.”“I have money you can use.” I blurted out. Both Skywalkers looked at me.I reached inside my Jawa cloak and called my inventory money to my hand. “I don’t know how much money there is. I don’t understand the currency. I took it off those lizard people that kidnapped me.”Shmi looked concerned at that comment, while Anakin looked at the money with a slacked-jawed expression. “See, mom! She can stay now. She’s too little to be alone with the Hutts around anyway.”“Hey! I took care of myself just fine against those bozos!” I puffed up my cheeks at him. “I even took their weapons off them.” I piled the two blasters I kept.Anakin’s eyes lit up at the giant blaster, and he moved to touch it, only for Shmi to hold him back.“Put that away. You don’t want the slavers around to see that.” She fretted over both of us before checking if the door was locked. I put the blaster back into my inventory, amused to see that she wasn’t fussing about a child keeping a blaster. Or me implying that I killed people.When she sat back down again, I pushed the money towards her. Shmi frowned at me before settling in her seat and giving me an impromptu lesson on the currency. It looks like I found a lot more money than they were used to.“Hey, are we going to see those spacers you took those from?” Anakin asked.I shrugged. “No, I shot them. They had me in a cage and took me off my home planet. I think they killed my mom. I don’t remember much.” I took back a quarter of the money and shoved the rest to Shmi. I kept the Mon Calamari, though. It was blue and squishy.“Keep this. If I’m staying here, I want to help with food. I can find more money on the ground as I did with these.” I pointed to the larger pieces of Wupiupi.Shmi didn’t like taking money from me, but she agreed. Being able to eat and not worry for a while was a relief.“Yippee! We’ll have so much fun, and you can be my partner in fixing my pod racer. Oh! Did you get the parts today?”“Ani, after dinner. Take Xai-Wan and wash up for dinner. I’ll be back.” Shmi pocketed a few coins and took the rest into a box she pulled up from under a board hidden underneath a rug in the kitchen corner.I resigned myself to Anakin dragging me around while we were on Tatooine.

Chapter 4: The Nubian Escape
It’s been a year since I landed on Tatooine and came into the family of Skywalkers.Luckily, Watto never found out about me. I’ve come to accept Shmi as ‘Auntie Shmi,’ and Anakin was hard to place. I treated him as an amusing little brother, but he was the one who treated me as the little sister he needed to protect. When Anakin was at the shop, I helped Shmi with money, and she saved it as a fund for necessities, and a small portion was saved back to free herself and Anakin, hopefully. The extra portions of money I kept were used as a slush fund for emergencies.On a side job, I took care to find more parts for Shmi to haggle for money discreetly. Anakin came up with the bright idea to make a scanner to find the chips hidden in both Skywalkers' bodies. Unfortunately, no matter what I did, I couldn’t find them. I could sense them, but I wasn’t at a higher level.I did reach level 9 in my nightly Runscript grind. I unlocked Technopathy-Communications which allowed me to talk to droids and convince them to do things for me. However, it seemed that the more advanced droids required Persuasion Checks to make them do what I wanted.Another thing that Technopathy gave me was the option to go into my Gamer Options and set background music for myself. It amused me so much and even gave me the option to rewatch movies I had watched in my past life while Paused. I’m making it a side project to create a laptop-Persocom from Chobits to share cartoons I watched for Anakin. I made it a goal to recreate Sumomo. Well, maybe less perky. Anakin made it a mission to finish C-3PO before I could complete Sumomo.We’re neck and neck, and he’s beating me. I can’t connect to the Holonet with Sumomo, but I manage to give her projection capabilities for the movies with sound. She can either project like a regular droid through her eyes or use her travel monitor. It’s a little tricky, but I got color in the movies the same as any HD movies back on Earth. I don’t see the point in hologram blue. Her personality was still robotic, though. More akin to Kotoko than Sumomo. Or Google translate. Sumomo 2.0 doesn’t have synthetic skin but rather a polished silver metal covering her parts. I also made clothes to cover her metal flesh as there was not much else to do to personalize her. I may just have to paint her skin color on. No telling where I’m going to get magenta hair for her.On other ventures, I have yet to figure out how to use the Party function. For example, even though it was unlocked, I couldn’t add Anakin to my party. My Relationships tab said that Anakin was only an Ally/Level 3. I wonder if I must level up that tag to invite him fully. On the other hand, I could bring him on my quests without him being in my party to the low-level dungeons I found around Mos Espa.He didn’t know what was happening but was always happy with the loot we ‘found’ in our adventure. Little Ani seemed quite cheerful to kill womp rats and the goblin-looking monsters with me. It made me worry that I may have unlocked Youngling Slayer 9000 a little too early when he cackled a bit too much during a speed run on a dungeon that we did before. But, on the other hand, I was doing it too. So maybe I shouldn’t worry about it. Most of the treasure was parts he could use for his pod racer and more money to give his mother.I went out twice a week for a year to comb Mos Espa of loose change. Finally, with a year of constant searching, I think I have enough to pay for one of the Skywalkers. Shmi, most likely as Anakin, would be able to free himself later in the Boonta Eve Classic. It was a pain to find it all, but oh so worth it.
Primary Quest Update: Pod Racer Builder - God Save the Nubian Queen

A Nubian Class cruiser has landed on Tatooine in need of help. So do what you can, and maybe you’ll leave Tatooine!
I paused from my new stitch work for Sumomo as she sat on my shoulder. Anakin was still at Watto’s, and Shmi was here with me making dinner.Closing my eyes, I tried to use the Force to sense the Jedi I knew were here. Ani’s bright presence in the market district warmed happily at me when I skimmed him by. Beyond the districts, there were two new bright Force presences off at the outskirts of Mos Espa. I felt their auras pause at mine before they both tried to reach out. I pulled back before contact was made.”Shmi! We’re having guests!” I ran into the kitchen. She didn’t pause her stirring.“Why don’t you set the table then, hmm? I think we have enough extras for everyone.” Lady Skywalker was a person of stone, not even blinking at me and my craziness. I guess if you suddenly got pregnant with a Force-Sensitive baby out of nowhere, not much can phase you.I set the table for everyone and ran back to the kitchen to help Shmi make more food.Just in time too.“Mom, I’m home!” Then, taking a cloth, Shmi wiped her hands, and I followed her.“These are my friends, Mom, Xai-Wan.” Anakin brought back a group of people and a droid with him.“Hello,” Jar-Jar said.The behemoth Jedi turned to Shmi. “I’m Qui-Gon Jinn. Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.” He looked down at me and nodded.I turned to look at Ani as he dragged Padme off to see Threepio, and R2-D2 followed them.Shmi went back to the kitchen, and Jar-Jar followed her. I craned my neck as I looked up at Liam Neeson’s double as he smiled at me.“You’re really tall.” I bluntly stated.“Tall. Tall.” Sumomo said flatly, raising her fists in the air. The only startlement I saw was him blinking his eyes at me before he let out a chuckle. He looked at Sumomo and then back at me.“Well, there are many beings taller than you, young one. There are even some that are your height or smaller.” So he knelt to be at my level.I hummed in agreement with him.“It is nice to meet you, Xai-Wan. You’re Ani’s sister, aren’t you?”“No, we’re just friends. I call Shmi Auntie, though, since I live with them.”Qui-Gon looked puzzled. I shrugged at him and thought I might as well tell him something.“Some nasty lizard people kidnapped me from Stewjon and kept me in a cage. I escaped, but I crashed the ship here. And then Anakin found me, and I helped him find some parts, so he invited me back home. That was a year ago.”“Stewjon?” The Jedi looked alarmed, and he glanced at my covered head.My hair darkened to a vibrant red copper tone in the past year. I really like it, but since I’m on Tatooine, Shmi made me keep my head covered. She even made fitted caps for me to switch on off days. Though I still turn heads with my Heterochromia eyes once people notice. One eye is my regular russet brown, and the other is a grey color.I miss just being a plain Asian-American from Earth. Sort of. I still have Asian features, but my Stewjon mother affected my coloring. At least it would be easier to dye my hair blue or something.“You know, young one. I have a student from Stewjon back on the ship. His name is Obi-wan-”“Kenobi!” I chirped at him with a smile. “Kenobi! Kenobi!” Sumomo mimicked me as she stood on my shoulder and grabbed the side of my headscarf of the day.Qui-Gon blinked at me. His eyes flickered between my Persocom and me a couple of times.“Well, yes. How did you know?”I leaned side to side as I had his full attention. “Mmm, they give Force-Sensitive kids the title Kenobi. It means Child of the Stars in Stewjoni. I think my mom was taking me to the Jedi before the lizard people killed her and took me.”“Ah. I’m sorry little one.” He held his giant hand on my head, giving me a sad look. Then, with the added weight on my head, I stilled my body to blink my eyes up at him. (Even kneeling, he’s still so tall!)“It’s okay. I don’t remember her. I don’t even know her name or my father’s… Or the previous years I lived with them.”I stared at him intently, and he awkwardly coughed at my statement. Inwardly I cackled, but Qui-Gon must have sensed it because he smirked at me, catching my mischief. I pouted at him. I gave the game away. He got up from his kneeling position and picked me up, causing me to squeal in surprise.Sumomo, my loyal machine, just repeated my squawks in monotone while climbing up Qui-Gon’s shoulder. I really need to fix her personality chip.“Well, Lady Shmi and Jar-Jar are done with dinner. Why don’t we go find Ani and Padme?” I squirmed in his arms to be put down, but Qui-Gon didn’t relent his grip on me, well versed in rowdy younglings. So, I flopped over in a huff and played dead.Qui-Gon laughed as he readjusted his grip and rested my head on his shoulder and my bum on his forearm. I pouted. I can’t tell if I was happy or not to be carried like a kid again.I sighed out loud and thudded my head against him. There was no one better to carry me than Liam Neeson. Ultimate dad from Taken.Qui-Gon carried me to Anakin’s workroom, where we found R2 and Threepio talking about nakedness.“Lunch is ready.” Anakin looked at me and almost bristled at the familiarity the Jedi was carrying me with. However, he settled when he clumsily reached out with the Force to me and felt that I was content. He was getting better at that since I’d shown him.Qui-Gon raised an eyebrow at Anakin but gestured us back to the dining room.Shmi and Jar-Jar were carrying food back to the table when we arrived to sit at the table.As with most food functions, we started eating, and conversations started. It eventually came to the topic of slavery and all the enslaved people having transmitters inside them.Everything went the same as it did in the movies. I watched as Jar-Jar ate food, and Qui-Gon caught his tongue to reprimand him. I giggled, and Anakin smiled.“You’re a Jedi Knight, aren’t you?” Anakin asked Qui-Gon suddenly. His question made the Knight admit that he was one and was on his way to Coruscant.“How did you end up in the Outer Rim?”“The same way I did, Ani. A ship.” I smirked at him, and he gave me a deadpan look.“I know that!” Then, he stuck out his tongue at me, and I did it back. Then, we started making faces at each other while Shmi looked at us like the exasperated mother that she was.“Our ship was damaged, and we’re stranded here until we can repair it.” Padme interrupted our face fight #65.“I can help. I can fix anything.” Ani looked at Padme earnestly.I scooped up my food as I watched the rest of the conversation unfold. Anakin is going to enter the Boonta Eve Classic. I have to be ready with the money for Shmi.

While I was distracted, lunch was finished. Just in time, too, since the sandstorm outside was calming down. It was agreed that Qui-Gon and Anakin would return to Watto’s shop.Qui-Gon bartered a deal with Watto for the hyperdrive parts, and I went to the pod racer to start the finishing repairs before Anakin came.I held my hand to the racer and concentrated on my Technopathy to see if any missing parts or repairs were left. After getting a mechanic response from the pod, I knew now that a couple of wires were damaged that I had replacements for in my Inventory. The one thing I was missing was a power charge for the central pod.I frowned. Shit.I pulled out the wires and got the soldering iron to replace said wires. I tsk’d when I saw that it looked like the wires were chewed on. Womp rats.“How goes the repairs, Xai-Wan?” I glanced up at my work and saw that it was Kitster.“We’re missing a power charge. I’m also fixing the wires right now. Womp rats.” I leaned down again to finish the soldering.“Oh, man. Why is it always womp rats.” Kitster complained. He had a right to; the other slave boy had been helping me find parts for Anakin.I put down the equipment I had on hand. “Hey Kit, do you have a power charge we can use? I don’t have any on me.”He patted his pockets and shook his head.I sighed again, but then I remembered! “I think we can get one. Come on, Mr. Jinn can find one for us.”“Who?” I dragged the taller boy with me.We passed by Anakin, heading back to the pod racer, but Qui-Gon wasn’t with him. We started running around a corner when the both of us collided with a human wall.“I think you should look before you run into more people, younglings.” The Jedi’s amused tone spoke down to the heaping pile of Kitster and me.“Mr. Jinn! We need a power charge for the racer. I fixed the chewed wires for Ani, but we still need that charger thingy.” I said from the floor since Kitster decided he wanted to be deadweight and wouldn’t get off me.I wiggled on my belly, but Kitster only pressed down harder on me. “Kitster, get off me, fatty!”“What? I can’t hear you. You’re so small your voice can’t reach me.” I let out an annoyed growl at him. I was about to do something before we were bodily lifted by our shirts off the ground and set down on our feet by the giant man beside us.“Now, now. No fighting. I’m sure we can find a power charge for Anakin.”That led the three of us to search the junkyard for parts before Kitster rushed by me and gave the part to Qui-Gon. Why am I competing with children? Oh, right, I’m still a kid. With part in hand, we walked back to Ani. Well, until Kitster challenged me to a race. I won. He denied it.“Ouch!” I heard Anakin yelp. I rushed over and saw blood on his arm. He pushed me back. “I’m fine. I’m fine. We’ll fix it later. We need a-”“Power charge. Here you go. Let’s see if it works.” Qui-Gon gave the part to Anakin.I heard a weird warbling sound, and I looked over and saw Jar-Jar with his tongue hanging out. What is he doing?It looked like his arm was stuck, and Anakin was about to turn on the engines. I was about to walk over, but Padme helped him out.Anakin started the engines and released a triumphant cry as the engines turned on.“It’s working! It’s working!”Turning off the engines, Ani leaped off his pod, and he and Kit jumped around.“Why don’t we paint it?” Padme somehow magically found paint on this dust ball. It turned into a group effort as we painted yellow and blue stripes on the racer. Finally, the late afternoon turned to night as Kit said his goodbyes for the day.Heading back home, Shmi had prepared dinner for everyone. We ate heartily, and Auntie doled out sleeping places for the night. I helped her with the linens. Sumomo was on her charge port in the work room with R2-D2 and Threepio.“Ani! Bedtime!” I glanced out the door outside. I saw Qui-Gon with Ani.“Ani, I’m not going to tell you again.”Anakin didn’t take long to come inside after that. Noticing the opening, I walked outside too. The extra sheets were my excuse.“Obi-Wan, run an analysis on this blood.” I watched the man speak to a device that looked like a Gillet razer.I crept closer as I heard Space Jesus' response about a 20,000 midi-chlorian count for Anakin.“What ‘cha doing?” Qui-Gon jumped. Huh, I surprised the Jedi.“Ah, Xai-Wan. I’m speaking with Obi-Wan right now.”“What’s a midi-chlorian?” But, of course, at this point, I was just making conversation.“Master?” A tiny voice squeaked from the communicator.“Apologies, Padawan. I need a separate blood count for another youngling.” Obi-Wan confirmed his readiness.“Would you like to find out?” Qui-Gon held out his hand.I put my hand in his with glee. “What is it? What is it?” I hopped in place. I think I heard a chuckle from the communicator.I felt a pinch as the Jedi took my blood sample using his device. “One minute, Master.” The voice came again.I heard a gasp. “Master, this one is 18,000 like Master Yoda’s. Where are you finding these children?”“Xai-Wan!” Shmi appeared in the doorway.Like a deer in headlights, I gestured with the linen in my arms at Qui-Gon. Make him take the fall. Uh oh. She had her arms on her hips now. Shoving the blankets at Qui-Gon, I ran back to the room I shared with Anakin before Shmi could say anything more.I shut the door behind my back in my room and climbed into the bed I shared with Anakin. It didn’t bother me to share a bed. I did it with my older brother well into our middle school years.“Ani, you still awake?” I was facing the back of his head.“Yeah. I’m too excited to sleep.” He turned to face me. His blue eyes were still bright in the low lighting in our room.“You still have that cut on your arm?” I was already reaching towards him.He held out his arm that still had his scrape.I touched the edge of it. I wonder if I can do Force Healing yet. Grogu did it. Maybe I can.Closing my eyes, I mainly drew onto the Force around us and a bit from me into my fingertips. I did it slowly so I wouldn’t catch Qui-Gon’s attention. Pushing the energy into the scrape, I felt it heal slowly. Then, I started singing Rapunzel’s healing chant from Tangled to amuse myself.Anakin gasped as the wound healed. Then, unknowing to me, my fingertips started to glow yellow like Rapunzel before fading.

I felt winded as I opened an eye. “Did it work?”“Wizard! You gotta show me how to do that.” He loudly whispered.I smiled. “As long as you meditate with me and work on that shielding. I noticed you were barely shielding today. Did you do tonight’s work?”Anakin groaned. “No.” He grumbled.Chuckling, I laid on my back, and Anakin did the same. I clutched his hand, and he gripped mine back. “We’ll do it together.”Closing our eyes, we meditated. It was something I brought up to Anakin when I told him of the Force that first night we met. I kept it vague as I didn’t want to limit his imagination. He was supposed to be the Chosen One. He had to have a creative license with it. I stressed that we had to protect ourselves from slavers in all ways possible. He took it with enthusiasm.Thus, the nightly meditation sessions and building our mind palace. I took the idea from Harry Potter fanfiction, and Anakin ran with it.A local library represented my mind. I used to visit it with my friends during my school years. The main hangout where I protected myself was the second floor, where the tower of the building was situated. When one walked up the stairs to the second floor, they would come across shelves about 4 feet high and a reception desk. Past the reception desk led to the open back sitting area.That area was circular, with a giant concrete column in the middle supporting the tower structure. Around the column were soft bench chairs, and on the floor were movies, books, and floor-rocking gaming chairs that I loved sitting on but was really easy to tip backward and fall. To protect my mind, I imagined the concrete walls strengthening and coating the building with what I imagined the Marvel metal Proto Vibranium. Of course, all the media items around me were in Earth languages like Lao, English, and Japanese, not Aurebesh or any other alien languages.On the other hand, Anakin imagined his workshop with his Pod Racer along with an open racetrack. I told him to go wild on how he would protect it, and he came up with getting lost in the race. Different checkpoints were required to reach a specific part of his mind. He added different things to make it harder, such as the speed at which one had to reach a checkpoint or leap over a specific rock. Tusken Raiders and sandstorms littered the track as protection or false trails. Herds of banthas and Eopies also ran around his mental space, and a Jawa Sandcrawler moved around the track.As we shore up our shields from the daily grind, Anakin felt more at peace, and his brilliant presence lessened in intensity before slipping off to sleep. Moments later, I did the same.

“Get up, get up!” Anakin jerked my petite body into a standing position. “Today is the Boonta Eve!”After making sure I was up, he dragged me to the kitchen. Shmi was already up, and Qui-Gon was as well. Padme and Jar-Jar weren’t far behind us.“Good morning, my young friends.” He set down plates of food for us.I sleepily ate my food. I still have trouble getting up, no matter what training I put this body through. It must be how young I am.Feeling refreshed, I set my plates in the sink and walked into the work room to get Sumomo. She’s coming with me today, so I can work on her during the race. I think I found a solution to her personality problem.I was about to leave with Anakin and Padme to set up the pod racer before I forgot my quest. Instead, I ran to Shmi’s fund for freedom and put it in a pouch with my earnings before shunting it all into my Inventory. I need to stay with Qui-Gon today.I walked over and stood next to him as he prepared to go out. He looked down at me with a raised eyebrow. We stared at each other before I forgot that my hair was out.I ran back to my room, put on my Jawa cloak, retrieved my headscarf, and came back running to him while doing my hair. Then, tucking my hair back, I yelled, “Tada!” with my hands spread out.Qui-Gon laughed. “So, I take it you are coming with me today?”“Yes, you need me when we see Watto about the bet.”He raised an eyebrow at me as we walked outside. I waved bye to Shmi to let her know I was leaving with him.“So, so Watto bet a lot of money on Sebulba. If you bet against him again, you’ll try and bet the pod racer for Ani and Shmi, but he won’t take it.” So I did my little magic trick and pulled out the money I had.“Here.” I held out the pouch to him, and he looked surprised when he felt the amount of money inside. It was a big pouch of the larger wupiupi. “It should be enough for one of them. If you bet the racer, we can free both.” I beamed at him while making sure no one saw me hand it to him.Qui-Gon smiled at me. He tied the pouch to his waist and lifted me into his arms again. “You surprise me, Xai-Wan. However, I will take your advice.”I think he must have chalked it up to me using the Force to have a vision of his conversation. Whatever works. Incognito at its finest.We had made it not even ten paces away from the dwelling before Jar-Jar came rushing up behind us. Qui-Gon sighed as I laughed when the Gungan fell face first.Upon reaching the garage for the pod racers, we were immediately met with Watto. Qui-Gon let me down as he set to negotiate with the blue Toydarian.“No pod is worth two slaves, not by a long shot.” Watto rasped to him, glaring.“Not even with this thrown in?” The Jedi played coy, hefting the large pouch I gave him.Watto’s eyes bulged as he heard the twinkling inside.The pod and this against the boy and his mother.” Qui-Gon said firmly.As an incentive, Qui-Gon opened the pouch and showed him the gold coins.Watto growled, “Where did you get that? You didn’t have that yesterday.”“Let’s just say I came into some luck finding this money. All legally sound too.” He smiles at the Toydarian.Watto eyes the pouch, thinking hard about the offer. “Fine. Prepare to lose everything to me, outlander!” He flew off.We watched him fly off before turning to each other. Jar-Jar was looking at us as well. Grinning widely, I hugged Qui-Gon.“He took it! He took it!” I started bouncing in place. He chuckled and patted my shoulder, looking away from me.We walked to Anakin, Shmi, Padme, and Kitster, who arrived with his racer.“What’d he mean by that?” Anakin meant the remark that Watto made before we stood before him.“I’ll tell you later.” Was Qui-Gon’s answering reply.I was off to the side with Shmi when I watched Padme's funny conversation with Ani and Kitster. I bet she was feeling underwhelmed about Ani’s chances of winning.Together we moved the racer to the starting line. Anakin was doing last-minute checks before his mother had a small conversation with him.At the back of the racer, I saw Sebulba pushing something out of alignment on our pod. I waited until he talked to Anakin before going over to the exact part and repairing it with Technopathy. Hopefully, that would hold up until the end of the race. I’m getting better at using less FP at tasks.“Whoa!” I missed Qui-Gon’s question as he lifted Anakin into the racer. He whispered to Anakin the same advice about using his instincts before departing. I followed him with a yell, “Good luck, Ani!” before walking to Kitster and the droids.Everything happened the same as in the movie, apart from the racer falling apart. Even the hiccup at the beginning of the race. I sat down on a box and took out my small tools to start working on Sumomo. It took me most of my Runscript time for multiple weeks, but I figured out her issue.I looked up as Anakin’s friends started cheering as he passed his first lap. I smiled as I slipped another part into Sumomo before closing her chassis and redressing her. It’s done.Sumomo’s eyes blinked as she came online. “Hello, Z! Are you ready for your morning workout?!” Her high-pitched yell caught the attention of the rest of our party.I laughed. Sumomo decided to just say Z instead of saying my real name. It was either that or Kenobi with her.“Sumomo, I already did it before I fixed your chip. You were just sleeping.” Sumomo gasped as she wailed and started swinging her arms while clad in a grey tunic, tan pants, and a grey hat for her bald head.“It’s okay. It’s okay. We’re cheering Ani for his race now.” I turned her to the racetrack.A glint appeared in her eyes. “Go, Ani, Go! Go, Ani, GO!” She began waving a makeshift flag using my screwdriver and a ripped rag she tied to it. R2 beeped to the same tune, and Threepio said, ‘Oh my.’The two boys with me stared at my not-a-plum-colored Persocom before they started saying, “Go, Ani, GO!” Kids.They kept it up well until the third lap before gasps were released when Anakin was forced onto the service ramp that launched him into the air. Cheers ignited when he landed and pulled out in first place.The crowds near us started cheering, “Go Ani, GO!”Without the sabotage, Anakin gained a significant lead on Sebulba before passing the finish line. Crowds cheered as Anakin pulled around his pod racer and gathered around him. He won.Events happened quickly as I stayed with Shmi vibrating in anticipation. Then, finally, our front door opened, and Qui-Gon and Anakin came back.“Mom, we sold the pod! Look at the money we have.” He held out the rectangular wupiupi to her.“And you both have been freed.”“What?!” Both Skywalkers turned to the man as he smiled.“I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish it if Xai-Wan didn’t give me a surprisingly large bag of money.” Both turned to look at me.“What do you think I do all day? I’m not looking for mushrooms, that’s for sure. I did have to go into your funds, Auntie, but we did it.”Shmi was speechless. Her eyes teared, but not a drop fell as she fell to her knees and hugged Anakin and me tightly. She was mumbling, “You’re free.” At the same time, she kissed Ani’s hair repeatedly.

Whoa, my Karma meter glowed brightly as it filled up, and an option popped up to me asking if I wanted to use it. So naturally, I decided to save it for the battle of Naboo instead. And I guess I became family to the Skywalkers too. It’s still weird how Relationships work in this universe. Do Anakin and I get a bonus in fighting or something when we fight together?And Yes! I can invite the himbo blonde to dungeon quests, finally! The more dangerous ones too. I wonder if I can find a dungeon in the Temple?“There is room on our starship for all of you if you want to go to Coruscant.” The Jedi stood there as he relayed his offer. I blinked when I was brought back to the conversation in front of me.“We get to go on your starship!” Spaceship! My inner Lego astronaut popped up again. I had to suppress a smile.Kneeling, Qui-Gon looked at the both of us. “Training to become a Jedi is not an easy challenge. Even if you succeed, it’s a hard life.”“But I wanna do it. I saw it in my dreams.” Then, turning to Shmi, Anakin asked permission to be a Jedi.Looking at Shmi Qui-Gon said, “Regardless of their choice, we will do what we can to relocate you all to a more hospitable planet than Tatooine. The Queen even offered a place on Naboo once we dealt with the Trade Federation.”I twitched unnoticeably about the thought of Shmi living on Naboo. Not with Palpadick around, she’s not.Shmi smiled softly, “Anakin. This path has been laid before you. This choice is yours and yours alone.”“I wanna do it.” She looked resigned before combing his hair back. Then Shmi looks toward me. “Will you go with him as well?” I nodded. She pulled me closer and kissed my forehead.“Go, we need to pack.” She turned back to Qui-Gon as she nudged us to our room. Her face was stern, and she appeared to want to say more to him alone.“YIPPEE!” Anakin raced back to our room before zipping around to grab parts for Threepio. I kept most of my things in my Inventory, but I did put the rewards Anakin earned from our dungeon crawling into my Inventory when he seemed to forget them. If anything, it would distract him on a dull day. And Pallies, lots of Pallies. I think I can grow them in the temple.I was most excited about not wearing my scarf all the time. And a water bath. Sonics feel weird, but it appeals to the germaphobe in me.Taking one last look around, I noticed Anakin’s scanner. Reaching out, I tried to sense what else it needed. I hope my most recent level-up will help me.Small blue arcs of lightning danced across the device before I saw in my mind the missing parts. It so happened that Anakin’s rewards were the missing pieces.Making sure no one was there with me, I waved my hand while Technopathy did its work. Parts were disassembled before combining with the ones I had and reassembling themselves.A ping from Gamer’s Mind alerted me to the completed product. With Zelda sound effects. Awesome.

“Hey, what are you doing?” Anakin came back in with Threepio.I held up his scanner. “I fixed it. Are you giving this to Kitster?”Anakin’s eyes lit up in glee before trying it on himself. It dinged when he held it over a specific spot on his body. He rushed to his mom, and I followed him.“Mom!” He didn’t let her answer him before waving the scanner over her.“There! This is where your chip is! I’m giving this to Kitster when we leave.” He smiled proudly.Shmi held her hip on the spot where the scanner revealed her chip’s location. “That’s incredible, Ani.”We eventually were able to pack our essentials and Threepio. Sumomo was riding on my head, humming as we exited our home.Anakin rushed off when he saw Kitster, and we saw him give the scanner to him and hug him. Goodbyes were said, and he came back to us.It was a slow trip due to C-3PO and his complaints about not being finished. To drown him out, I connected to Sumomo through Technopathy. My little droid started playing the Force theme song through the speakers I installed on her shoulders. The wool cloth did nothing to hinder the sound coming from Sumomo.Qui-Gon looked puzzled at my Persocom, but he decided to let it go. The song was familiar to him that he couldn’t place it.As we reached the edge of town, my inner background music started playing a creepy tip toe sound. A chill went down my spine like a bug was crawling on me. What the? Unfortunately, Sumomo was still connected to me as the Force theme cut off and started playing a boss theme. A familiar Final Fantasy boss theme. It was FFVIII’s version of Don’t be Afraid for the X-ATM092 mechanic spider boss.The orchestra instruments were playing out loud by Sumomo, motivating the players i.e., us, to fight while getting the heart pumping. Drums bang in, and it added an increased cadence as we came closer to the ship.
Oh shit. 
I started rushing to where a new marker appeared on my compass, “Ani, let’s go! Hurry!”Thinking it was a game, Anakin raced me. Qui-Gon and Shmi hurried after us as Threepio had to hustle faster, complaining.
Primary Quest: Escape Darth Maul

[X] Accept [ ] Decline
Well, that’s not encouraging at all. Sumomo was hanging on for dear life on top of my head.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. Sumomo, stop playing that song!


Sorry Master, I can’t. You’re the one playing it, not me!

Qui-Gon immediately lit his lightsaber and turned around. “Run!”“Oh no, oh no!” Threepio was very slow to the point I just used Force Pull to get him to the ship faster. “Master Anakin!” He wailed as his body was pulled with us.“Go, tell them to take off!” The hooded Zabrak jumped off the speeder and engaged Qui-Gon in a duel. Anakin had stopped to see the fight before Shmi, who reached us, pulled him to the ship.Up the ramp, we went, and I threw Threepio inside. “I do not like this!”“Qui-Gon said to start the ship! He’s in trouble!” Panaka looked alarmed, but he ushered us to the cockpit and informed the pilot. Obi-Wan told him to fly low.I stood on my tiptoes as we flew over Qui-Gon and Maul. The pair were still fighting, but in one parry, Qui-Gon turned and leaped onto the ramp just as we flew past them.Anakin, Shmi, Obi-Wan, and I ran back to the entrance to see the older Jedi on the floor gasping. R2 stood over him.“Are you alright?” Anakin said once we reached him.“I think so.” He turned to his apprentice.“What was it?” The Coruscant lit in the other Kenobi’s voice made me squeal on the inside. It’s Ewan McGregor’s doppelganger! Christian from Moulin Rogue! My favorite musical. Can Space Jesus sing like McGregor?“I’m not sure. But it was well trained in the Jedi arts.” He looked at everyone before going back to the Padawan. “My guess it was after the Queen.”“What should we do about it?” Anakin asked.“Ani!” Shmi chided him. “You’re still a little boy.” Anakin looked defiant.Qui-Gon breathed for a moment and nodded at her. “We should be patient.”Looking at us, he waved his hand and said, “Anakin and Shmi Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.”“Hi.” Ani shook his hand, and Obi-Wan smiled and nodded.“And this,” He gestured to me, who was on Obi-Wan’s left side, “is Xai-Wan Kenobi.”“What?!” Anakin cried out in shock. “Are you related? Why didn’t you tell me you had a brother?!” Shmi looked startled.I lifted an eyebrow at him. Well, more like tried. I ended up lifting both. “I don’t have any blood siblings, Anakin. Kenobi is a title on Stewjon. They’re given to Force-Sensitive kids. It translates to Child of the Stars.”Obi-Wan looked astonished. He hadn’t known that about his name as he was the only Stewjoni at the temple.“Kenobi! Kenobi! Kenobi!” Sumomo cheered from my head. I lifted her from her perch and took off my headcover.Red copper hair fell out of it as I shook my head. “I’m free!” I threw the cap at Ani, and he spluttered. I heard R2 laugh in binary as his head swirled around. Other Kenobi looked amused.“It is very nice to meet you, little Kenobi.” Obi-Wan’s cheeky grin was locked onto me as he held out his hand.“It’s nice to meet you too, big Kenobi!” I shook his hand. We all laughed.Sumomo, who was still connected to me, cut off the Don’t be afraid theme once the cabin door closed. Instead, she started dancing in my hand when Final Fantasy 8 Victory Fanfare was sounded. Everyone looked confused as the song turned off after a few moments.We then felt the ship exit Tatooine’s atmosphere before we hit hyperspace. I was about to speak again, but I yawned heavily and let go of Obi-Wan’s hand.“It’s sleepy time! It’s sleepy time!” Sumomo started chanting and banging her tambourine from my hand. Then she stood at attention and started playing TAPS straight from my head. I instantly froze and almost went to attention. Good thing, too; otherwise, I would have dropped my Persacom. Oh god, I’ve been out of Active Duty a decade, died, and lived again, and yet the military instincts will never go away for me. I thought to myself.Everyone in the vicinity stops to listen to the bugle call playing the solemn twenty-four-note song.“What is this?” Obi-Wan asked inquisitively, breaking the silence.“I am not a this! Sumomo is Sumomo! I am the miniature Persocom unit of my creator Xai-Wan Kenobi.” Sumomo huffed, pulled out her tablet from my pocket, and remotely connected to it. “Sumomo! すもも！ Sumomo!” was typed out in English, Japanese, and Aurebesh for all to see. She held the screen above her head and started glaring at Obi-Wan.“I built her. I still have to find fake purple hair and make better clothes for her.” Sumomo was still dressed in her grey clothes, and she had her hat on her head that I fastened with a chin strap. Unfortunately, she was bald except for the main connector pull cord I put on the back of her head.Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan asked, “Fake purple hair?”“Why does it need to be purple?”“Because Sumomo is Sumomo! I need to have my magenta hair because Master says so.” She dropped the screen to her side so she could fold her arms and smiled self-assured.They both looked at me, along with Anakin and Shmi. The Skywalkers never questioned why I wanted purple so much.“Sumomo means plum in Japanese. It’s a play on her name. Oh, plums are purple.” I added the last as an afterthought.“Japanese..?”Sumomo saved me from answering about Earth languages when she brought out the tiny whistle that Anakin made her. He now regretted that decision. “It’s sleepy time! It’s sleepy time for the little ones!” She jumped on my shoulder and held onto my hair as she pointed deeper into the ship.“I’m not sleepy!” Anakin protested. His yawn later disproved it. I yawned again after seeing him do it. “S-stop it!” Ani yawned again. The adults laughed at us as we were taken to an area we could rest. I quickly fell asleep after that.

Status Healed: Headache
I woke up to find myself cuddling up to  Anakin with a red blanket over us. Shmi was on the opposite side of the couch area, just waking up. We had felt the change shudder through the ship as we reached the capital.“Ani.” I lightly slap his cheeks. He murmured grumpily as I roused him from slumber.“We’re landing!” He moved to get out of bed but made a mistake as we fell onto the floor, wrapped up like a burrito. Ugh, the energy this child has.“Anakin, you nincompoop!” I yelled out in English.“Who are you calling a nincompoop?! I do not even know what that means!” He yells back. Anakin still had problems with English contractions.“I’ll show you what it means.” I was about to give him a noogie, but we were quickly separated.“Well, you’re certainly rowdy today.” We looked up at the tall Jedi and back at each other.“I’m going to see the pilot!” Anakin rushed away, and I stood there. Sumomo was on the table in a small charge port that I hooked up for her. Her eyes blinked open, and for a moment, I thought she was about to play Reveille. But, instead, she said, “Wakey, wakey, eggs, and bakey!”She launched herself at me and beamed, “Time for exercise?”“Mmm, not right now, Sumomo. We’re about to land.” She pouted before climbing up to my shoulder.The ship engaged in landing procedures as we came to a landing area. There was a shuttle parked there with people coming out.I held onto Anakin’s hand when he came out of the cockpit. I gestured at my head with my other hand when he looked at me. His mouth opened in a surprised look before he tightened his shielding. His Force presence evened out that it seemed like his power was under Obi-Wan’s.The three of us followed the Jedi and exited the ship with the Naboo party behind us. Greeting us were Chancellor Valorum and Palpatine.The Jedi bowed to them, and Ani and I did the same while holding hands. He needed the extra help to keep his Force presence less like the sun and more like a light bulb or campfire. He could do it on his own, but it wasn’t consistent in this new environment. Coruscant had the largest population he had ever felt. I was feeling overwhelmed too.“It is a great gift to see you alive, your Majesty.” My hand tightening on Anakin’s was hidden behind the Jedi, causing the blonde to tighten his shielding. I resolved not to look at Palpatine and instead looked at the handmaidens.Palpatine droned on as he introduced the Supreme Chancellor to everyone. The Chancellor nodded and said his greetings to the body double, walking her party to the grey shuttle.The two Jedi stood back as they talked to the Chancellor. Anakin looked back at Qui-Gon every few seconds, unsure what to do. Shmi also looked unsure as she held onto our shoulders.I really wish not to be in the same boat as the Sith. I tried to give baby eyes to the Jedi Master, but he waved his hand in a ‘go’ motion.“Shmi,” Padme said softly as she looked at the older woman. Then, looking at the young handmaiden, Shmi pushed us toward the shuttle. Although it took some maneuvering since I didn’t let go of Anakin’s hand, Shmi made me sit in her lap as we rode to 500 Republica to Palpatine’s apartment.Blegh.

Chapter 6: The Jedi
Reaching the senator’s abode was not fun or impressive. Everything was a gaudy red, from the floors to the furniture. I still held Anakin’s hand while he looked sick of doing shielding meditation. I gripped his hand harder as I glared at him to do as I said. He may be a foot and a half taller than me, but I can still boss him around.He sighed at me but maintained that persona of a weaker Force aura around Palpatine. We sat in a corner away from anyone, with Shmi’s hands combing my red hair. I was in her lap, and Anakin was on the floor, still holding my hand with a put-upon expression on his face. Jar-Jar was with us on another slim red chair.
Do you want to use your Karma?

[ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Ask later
I raised my eyebrow before choosing the ask later option. I don’t know when we leave for Naboo.We listened as Palpatine listed the options that the Queen could decide to do. The way he pushed her into a corner about the bureaucratic mess she was in was masterful as distasteful it was to say.I felt Shmi tighten her grip on my hair before loosening again. I had a feeling she could tell what Palpatine was doing, but she didn’t know what to do. Letting her play with my hair was the least I could to ease her tension.I looked out at one of the many balcony windows at the smog outside. I closed my eyes as I connected with Anakin through our shared contact. I leaned back to Shmi, and Anakin, still holding my hand, rested his head against my legs and his mother’s.In the Force, Anakin greeted me grumpily, but we helped each other with our shields. We weren’t hiding entirely. Just making us seem less noticeable.Meanwhile, Palpatine finished his conversation with the Queen and walked by us with a smile. Whether he knew about Anakin’s real potential was a mystery. Hopefully, the year of prep time had helped my brother from another mother with hiding from the Sith.It wasn’t long before a Nubian guard came with a message for the Skywalkers and me. We are to leave for the temple on Coruscant.Wanting one last goodbye, we went to see Padme, the ‘handmaiden,’ only to leave the message with the Queen instead. We bowed one last time and hurried to the Jedi shuttle.We were greeted by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan when we arrived at the temple. They led the way to the Council chambers.Standing in the middle of the chambers was a little bit uncomfortable. The councilors sat around us as they stared at the mixed party in front of them. Introductions were made before the talks began.“Master Jinn says both of you would like to become Jedi.” The Korun master stated from his seat.Anakin stared at the intimidating man before nodding, “Yes, sir. I want to be a Jedi.”Windu looked at me next. I blinked, still holding Ani’s hand. “Yes, I want to be one too.” He looked at our joined hands before nodding.“Test you, we will. Individually, before we talk.” Master Yoda said. “First, young Skywalker, he will go.”Qui-Gon moved behind me when I still held Anakin’s hand. I hesitated before releasing him. Inhales were heard as Anakin’s shielding fluctuated, revealing his true power before he tightened his control. “Oops.” The boy said.
!The Sith Master, Darth Plageuis, has noticed Anakin!

Who??? Oh shit, is that the one before Sidious?
I went tense before I sighed at Anakin. Not much I could do there except Reload a save, and I didn’t really want to do that. I really hoped this wouldn’t backfire on us all.Shocked but still moving, Qui-Gon led Shmi and me to a waiting room while he and Obi-Wan took a walk.Shmi and I sat there until well into the evening as the sky darkened for sundown. I sprawled over Shmi’s lap as it took time to test her son. Then, with nothing to do, my ‘Auntie’ combed through my hair instead of pacing around the room.The pleasant sensations were soothing, and I went into a doze. Our two Jedi escorts returned without me noticing and went to the council chambers without us. They brought back Anakin, who looked down at his feet, puzzled.I was nudged from my nap and taken to the council members. Rubbing my eyes, I heard the door shut behind me, leaving me with the Jedi Masters.“Jedi, you asked to be.” Master Yaddle spoke to me when I finished waking up.I blinked at her. “Yes, ma’am.” I was still groggy.“This will be a short test. But first, we like to verify your midi-chlorians count. We have a device here to check.” Master Windu waved to a device in his hand before gesturing me to him.I walked over and held out my hand. He took my palm and took a blood sample from my ring finger. He gave the analyzer to the Master beside him. “Now, we will test your senses. Merely tell us what you see.” Windu brought up a data pad that looked like a small paddle sign.“Use the Force, you must. Tell us.” The Grandmaster told me.Windu clicked through the program.
Mini-Game Started!

Use the Force, and guess what’s on the monitor! 

Reward: 100 exp. A spot as a Jedi initiate.
I looked excited. I love games. I stared hard at the back of the pad, concentrating on not using my Technomancy but instead the Force.A vertical meter bar appeared in my view with a red arrow at the bottom. A moving green bar was also in the meter. It took me a moment before I recognized the fishing system from Stardew Valley. My face looked quizzical before I tried using the Force and saw the red arrow move. My eyes narrowed as I increased my power, staying in the green lines before an image appeared like a mirage in front of me.“A weird frog.”Mace nodded before he gestured for me to go again. Yes!“Again.”“A ship.” The green bar moved faster.“Again.”“A Tauntaun.” The bar got even smaller and faster.“Again.”I squinted my eyes at him. It was a phrase in Aurebesh. Thank goodness I have Polyglot. There’s no way I would have learned the Aurebesh alphabet that fast.“I am one with the Force, and the Force is with me.”
Game Completed!

Reward: 100 exp. A spot as a Jedi initiate.
“Hmm.” Yoda leaned back as he considered me. “Close to young Skywalker, you are.”Looking him in the eye, I nodded. “He needs it.”Yoda frowned. “Attached you are. To be a Jedi, no attachments can be.”I tilted my head, “Then what are Masters and Padawans? Are they not attachments? You spend years together; it is in hum-” I blinked. “I mean in sentient nature to care for one another. What exactly is your definition of attachments?”Some Masters looked at each other as they contemplated the nature of the strange youngling before them. She was much more well-spoken than the average five-year-old initiate they had seen.“No beings can be truly detached. It is not in nature. Even animals need social contact. Why else would most species need companions? Humans, at least, have gone insane without contact with anyone. Babies need close contact with their parent or caregiver; otherwise, they don’t develop their milestones.” I told them. I thought about the case study on Russian orphan babies and their neglect.“Jedi must be without attachments to fulfill their duty to the Galaxy, young one.” Eeth Koth said as he spoke for the first time.“How can one care for the Galaxy if they don’t have attachments or compassion? For all you know, you might just be training a sociopath in Force powers and letting them loose on the Galaxy you’re trying to protect. You can’t ask someone to let go of something and not elaborate on that.”I turned to look behind me at the Zabrak, “And what does that have to do with being attached to Anakin? Of course, we’re friends. We’re like siblings now, and we only spent the last year living under the same roof. I even helped Master Jinn free Shmi and Ani from being slaves. Though we got to take their slave chips out of them.” I frowned at Koth before turning back to the Master of the Order.Master Windu looked annoyed, and it looked like he had a tick developing on his forehead. Several of the Masters looked the same or exasperated. It looked like someone forgot to tell the council something. (coughQui-Goncough).“When you say that Jedi have a duty to the Galaxy, are you asking if I can put the people above the individual?” I look directly at the Master of the Order.Windu looked at me before leaning closer, “Tell me, young one. If…Anakin was put in a situation where his life was weighed against a hundred beings. What would you do?”I narrowed my eyes as I thought about the answer. “I know Anakin can think for himself. He can get out of any situation if he’s given a chance. I know I can trust him to take care of himself. I will save the other beings if they’re in trouble.”The principles weren’t that different from the oath of enlistment for the Arms Forces, just with a religious order instead of a military branch. At least, that’s my opinion.The council members thought about my statement. They had a lot to think about my statement. This youngling was wise beyond her years. (If only they knew the truth.)“We will come to a decision. Please step out of the chambers.” Windu told me. I bowed before them and walked out the door.I saw Anakin jump up to his feet from the chairs and rush to me. “What did they say?”“They have to think about it.” I shrugged and pulled him back to the chairs.He groaned and sat back down. We waited and saw the evening light fade to the nightlife of Coruscant. As far as I can see, pretty lights slowly turned on as time passed before we were called back into the chambers.The five of us stood before the council members as they stared at us.“Jedi you wish to be. Tell me, Lady Skywalker. The father, who is?”Shmi looked startled to be addressed. She looked unsure as she looked at Qui-Gon before repeating what she told him. “There was no father. I carried him. I gave birth. I raised him. I can’t explain what happened.”The members glanced at each other as they sensed the truth of what Qui-Gon said about the boy.“What about you, Xai-Wan Kenobi? Who were your parents.” I looked wide-eyed at Windu.“I don’t know. My mom is Stewjoni, but I don’t know who my father is.” I looked at Anakin and back to the Master of the Order. “I do have a father, at least. Somewhere.” I rubbed my chin. “Maybe he went to buy a pack of cigarettes and just decided not to come back?” A Master or two looked troubled by my apathy at the thought of a father walking out of me.My head tilted to the side as I eyed Anakin. My eyes widened as I looked at the blonde. “Does that make you a clone of Shmi? If you don’t have a dad, but only a mom, that should make your DNA the same, just with some mutations like being blonde and a boy!”Anakin looked wide-eyed before looking at his mom, “Am I a clone?” He looked bewildered.“Ah.” Shmi didn’t know what to say. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan looked to be one second from laughing as well as some of the council.“Enough. Deliberate we will.” Yoda thumps his gimer stick. “With Master Jinn, the young ones will go until decided. Potential initiates, they may be.”

I looked at the pop-up in surprise. I forgot about that, but maybe we can get help for Naboo.
[X] Yes
The typical neon green letters disappeared before a red warning flashed before me like a hit to the face.
!Vision Incoming!
I let out a sound that sounded like a hiccup as I crashed into Anakin before blindly holding onto him. I felt dizzy as my vision of the council room disappeared, and scenes I remembered from The Phantom Menace appeared.My first vision was so disorienting that I accidentally drew on Anakin’s presence to help steady me. Unfortunately, I left myself open for all the Jedi masters and the lone Padawan to a front-row seat to my vision.
 “Hey, wait for me!” Anakin cried out from an N-1 Starfighter. 

 Qui-Gon turned his head to the boy, “Anakin, stay where you are. You’ll be safe there.”  

 “But I-” 

 “Stay in that cockpit.” Qui-Gon pointed at him as he and Obi-Wan powerwalked through the Theed hanger with the Naboo party. 

 As they reached the doors, they opened to reveal a hooded Zabrak with skin in red and black. 

 The scene changed and showed a screaming Anakin and R2-D2, “I’m trying to stop, I’m trying to stop!” in his starfighter crashing through the defenses of the Lucrehulk battleship and firing photon torpedoes at the main reactor before flying away. 

 Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fighting furiously with the Zabrak in a room full of plasma columns before the Zabrak kicked the Padawan off the ledge to fight the Jedi Master 

 Obi-Wan was staring intently with his lightsaber lit behind the ray shields. Meanwhile, Qui-Gon and the Zabrak were dueling. With one hit to the face, the Master was stunned before the red lightsaber was pushed into his gut. 

 “No!” Obi-Wan yelled behind the electron walls. Then, staring at the ground where his Master lay, the Padawan looked back to the darksider, which gave him a menacing look. 

 Out through the gate, Obi-Wan rushed at the Zabrak in a dazzling display of fighting prowess. Obi-Wan cut one end off the double-bladed weapon, forcing his opponent to one lightsaber.  

 It wasn’t until the darksider Force Pushed the Padawan into the reactor shaft that things seemed to be done for. But in a fantastic display of Force Pull and Ataru flip, Obi-Wan got the upper hand on the Zabrak, cutting him in half with Qui-Gon’s green lightsaber. The body of the red and black Zabrak fell into the reactor shaft, thus ending the fight. 

!Vision Ending!

The council room returned, and a fresh wave of nausea hit me. The Force rang out clarity, but that clarity was making me sick. So why did I want Force-Sensitivity again? Oh, right, the laser swords.I turned to look at Master Windu and Yoda before looking down and throwing up my lunch. Funny enough, Anakin did the same thing before we both started crying. But, oh god, why am I crying like a baby? I tried to stop, but the smell of vomit and the heaving hiccups were hard to stop. Anakin was right there with me, unable to stop his crying. Anakin kept seeing the image of Qui-Gon being stabbed, and I was upset that Obi-Wan started his path of infinite sadness. It was a feedback loop between us that was hard to break. I think I’m about to be sick again. My stomach roiled at the thought.I felt fear and horror emanate from the Jedi around us, and I assume Anakin also. Shmi was beside herself as she pulled us in and tried to soothe us, confused and worried. She wiped the vomit from our lips with a rag she had.For her, it seemed like everyone stood frozen for a few moments before her children became sick and crying. Master Plo Koon got up and knelt beside Shmi and us. Obviously, not in the vomit pools.“Calm, children. You are safe now. No need to worry.” The Kel Dor rumbled and laid his hands on both of our heads. A sense of peacefulness overcame us gently as my hiccups slowed and Anakin’s tears subsided.I shored up my shield and tried to disconnect from Anakin but couldn’t. The boy had a mulish look on him as he took my hand. Damn it. I activated big brother mode. Yup, the fierce protectiveness was radiating from him. Inwardly sighing, I decided not to shield for now.“First vision, this was?” Yoda had a calm look on his face. I looked at him but could not stop my lip from wobbling, so I nodded.Master Windu sighed heavily before rubbing his temples. Then, he reached into his robes and pulled out a communicator.“Yes, Master Windu?” a voice sounded from the device.“Have a junior Padawan escort these younglings to an initiate clan and give Lady Skywalker a room near them for the night. Be sure the Creche Master has experience with visions. One of the younglings had their first one.” An affirmative was given before a click was sounded.Another Master, the one with the braids, seemed to have the same thought and ordered a couple of cleaning bots for the room.While calls were made and one hand captured by a blonde, I took Master Plo’s hand off my head. However, I didn’t let go; no, I instead started looking at the differences between our hands. Anakin, the dork that he was, decided he didn’t mind the Kel Dor’s hand on his head while watching me play.Thick leathery skin covered the Kel Dor, and I saw that his species only had three fingers and a thumb. Plo Koon’s fingernails were also pointed with a giant one for his middle finger.While distracted by alien biology, I almost didn’t notice small droids come in to clean the vomit. My Scan from Technopathy automatically labeled them as cleaning droids. I watched in fascination as they cleaned up my vomit. How efficient. Space Roomba! But then, someone knocked on the doors and distracted me as a teenage Padawan entered the chambers. His appearance was typical, with hair cropped close with only his Padawan braid hanging from behind his ear.He walked to the center, bowed before the Masters, and turned to look at us.“Good evening, younglings, Lady Skywalker. I am Padawan Janson, and I’m your escort this evening.” He gave a charming smile to Shmi and then to us children. Well, this guy was a charmer.Anakin narrowed his eyes, suspicious of the other Padawan’s look at his mom. I gave Janson a blank look.“Oh, thank you.” Shmi smiled, more relieved that we children were calmer.“Where are we going?” I bluntly stated. He gave me a surprised look.“Why, to the Creche, of course! It’s on the other side of the temple, so we should get a move on. I alerted Master Ali-Alann of his new visitors. I also had some droids prepare a room for Lady Skywalker.” He gave another charming smile.Making my eyes extra wide, I looked up at him, giving Plo Koon’s hand back. “If it’s far away, can I have a piggyback ride? I have short legs.” Anakin shot me a betrayed look. He was torn between wanting a ride himself and me asking for it in the first place.“Uhh.” The Padawan said, trapped.“Please?” I made my eyes extra wet and shiny as I stared at him in fake adoration. It was easy to make my eyes watery from my crying fit earlier.“….Okay.”I smiled in victory.

I quickly ran around the teenager and jumped on his back. I looked at Anakin and stuck my tongue at him. He gave me mental applause at my manipulation, promising that he would do better than me. I felt a faint bit of pride settle in me. I taught him so well. Soon he’ll roll his eyes and say ‘Whatever,’ like any other millennial.  Padawan Janson tilted his head down and sighed. His good cheer was punctured a bit as he felt in the Force that the older Jedi were laughing at him.The Padawan I was using as a ride gave another sigh before his pleasant demeanor returned.“Well, we have a long journey to the Creche and little ones,” he jiggled me as he hopped in place, “to put to sleep.”Why do I feel like this is revenge?Padawan Janson jogged to the doors and held them open for Shmi and Anakin while giving me a bumpy ride. I scowled over his shoulder at the amused Jedi. I yanked lightly on the braid in front of me, causing him to yelp a bit, but the 15-year-old ignored me and started a tour guide explanation of the Temple to Shmi while jogging in place. Anakin was forced to walk faster to catch up with them.“Padawan!”Said Padawan halted as he turned back to face the room. It was Master Koon speaking.“Do take them to the Healers. I believe they need a check-up and their chips removed.” I felt a wave of excitement and anticipation from the Skywalkers as Padawan Janson did a half bow, and we left.“Bye, Big Kenobi!” I waved at the Padawan at the last minute.The doors to the room closed as the Masters, and one Padawan stared at them and then at each other.“This is already giving me a headache,” Mace complained, rubbing his temples.Yoda hum, “Young she appears, but wiser in mind she is.”Plo Koon settled back into his seat, “That was a strong vision she had. Not normally seen, especially in young ones.”Ki-Adi Mundi nodded in agreement, “Is it wise to take in these children? They are certainly different from the average youngling.”“Issue it is not. The vision young Kenobi had must be discussed.” Yaddle said over him.“Chancellor Valorum is the one who personally requested my help,” Qui-Gon admitted. “Due to the restraints he’s facing in the Senate, it was unofficial.”Mace stared hard at the other Jedi, “Why is it always you two?” Qui-Gon merely lifts his hands in a ‘What can you do?’ gesture and smile at him. He was unconcerned about the vision of himself dying. Obi-Wan, on the other hand, was worried.Mace turned to look at his fellow councilor, Plo Koon. “When Jinn and Kenobi leave with the Queen, I request you and one other make the trip to Naboo. Better for a trained Master than a child in a starfighter.”The Kel Dor nodded his head. He didn’t want a child to be forced to fight for his life either.“Always in motion, the future is. Clear-sighted, the young one is.” Yoda said thoughtfully.“If I may, Masters.” Obi-Wan interrupted, “I noticed when Xai-Wan received her vision, it wasn’t until she pulled on Anakin’s power to steady herself that we were all pulled in.”Qui-Gon rubbed his chin, “It is possible that with Anakin’s power, he made the vision clearer for us all to see. They are both strong individuals in the Force. They seem to teach themselves tricks in the Force I didn’t think possible for their age. In fact, Xai-Wan reached out to us after we landed on Tatooine. If not for her, Obi-Wan and I wouldn’t know they were there.”“Their shielding is strange too. I would have considered them average force-sensitive children if not for their mistakes.” Yael Poof muses.“Strange or not, it seems we will be taking in these children. Regardless, you have a mission to prepare for.” Mace Windu cut in. He was absolutely done with this conversation. It seemed like a massive unseen Shatterpoint cracked in front of him. For good or not. He didn’t know if taking these children into the Order was wise, but it was already done.“What of the mother? Where will Lady Skywalker go?” Depa Billaba glared at Qui-Gon. “After all, she was just saved from slavery.”The Jedi Master felt the glare of several Masters on him at that statement. Obi-Wan himself looked surprised. He hadn’t known this information.Qui-Gon coughed, “Ah yes, I did forget to mention that. Ani and Shmi were released from slavery, and Xai-Wan had saved herself the year previously. She was living with the Skywalkers while on Tatooine.”“And you didn’t seem to think to mention this before?” Adi Gallia raised an eyebrow.“I didn’t want to pollute your perception of the children,” Qui-Gon stated with his hands behind his back. He could feel the exasperated feelings his Padawan was mentally sending him.“Queen Amidala offered her a place on Naboo when the conflict ends,” The Maverick Jedi raised his brow, “Unless you have something better in mind?”“Perhaps, perhaps not,” Yoda said in contemplation.A beeping sound was heard in the room. Qui-Gon looked at his communicator and read the message.“It seems that we will be needed sooner than later.” He and Obi-Wan bowed to the council and left with Plo Koon and Kit Fisto.The Consalurs glanced at each other, unsure of the future.

Chapter 7: Healing Interlude
 “And here is the Healing Halls.” Padawan Janson said grandly as we arrived.The entire place smelled like antiseptic. I turned my head to a room further in and looked wide-eyed at the bacta tanks inside. They looked like the regen tanks from Dragon ball Z!“Padawan Janson. You haven’t hurt yourself or this youngling, have you?” A blue Twi’lek appeared out of the nether before us, looking stern at the human teen before her.My pack mule started denying all accusations. Janson's explanations about our presence were amidst his panicked denials.Hmm, I was beginning to see the differences between the movie Jedi and the real Jedi. They seemed to be more expressive than what was shown on Earth.Vokara Che’s lips thinned as she listened about the slave chips. Then, she turned around and called a human Padawan and Bothan Knight to her. In rapid succession, she listed her commandments to her minions before directing all three of us to different beds that lined the hall. Padawan Janson was told to sit in the chair away from us.The healer began her work with Shmi. First, she asked permission to touch and check Shmi over physically. She also asked permission for her students' attendance so they could learn what she was doing. Then, gaining permission, Healer Che instructed the Padawan and Knight Healers on the proper way to detect foreign objects in the body. Every now and then, she would ask Shmi, her first patient, a question and request to touch her.Closing her eyes, Vokara held her hand over Shmi’s body before stopping at the same spot that Anakin’s scanner had. Anakin was at the edge of his bed, watching in awe at the knowledge that his scanner really did work. He found the spot where his mother’s slave chip was.Both apprentice healers also closed their eyes as they focused on the Force to see what Vokara was doing. The younger male Padawan seemed to have trouble finding it, but the female Knight beside him helped direct him to the object in Shmi. Shmi looked slightly uncomfortable at all the attention on her but muscled through.Shmi was asked if she would like to be sedated to remove the chip on her right kidney side. She shook her head and shakily told her she wanted to be awake. Determination burned through the Force. Shmi wanted to see the removal firsthand.Healer Che nodded and motioned the Padawan to gather the supplies for the procedure. The younger man returned, and Shmi was told to lean back in the bed for the surgery.It was a quick removal after the numbing agent was applied. Bacta bandages were utilized at the site. Fifteen minutes later, Shmi was left staring at the container with the chip that had chained her life for so long.The trio then moved to Anakin and did the same procedure as Shmi, but with the Padawan and Knight trying their hand at detecting the explosive. Anakin made the same choice as his mother to stay awake through the process. Bandages were applied, and then they reached me.“I don’t have a chip.” Vokara Che raised her eyebrow. I raised mine back at her.I felt a wave of Force scan over me, “So you don’t.”“Do you know if you had your vaccinations?” I froze.I shrugged my shoulders at her. I don’t have my old smallpox scar from the vaccine. Safe to say, I probably don’t have any vaccinations from my previous life or this one.Healer Che looked at Shmi and asked her the same questions about vaccinations for her and Anakin. Receiving a negative from the mother, the healer told her Padawan to grab the three standard vaccines for new arrivals to the temple.The Padawan rushed off to do her bidding. Healer Che sighed and turned to Padawan Janson.“Tell Master Ali-Alann he won’t be receiving Anakin and Xai-Wan. They all need to stay quarantined for the time being. I don’t want them exposed to a random knight with a disease they don’t have protection for. Or heaven forbid we get another outbreak of Porg pox.” The blue Twi’lek grumbled as she gave the Knight a datapad to start filling out for Shmi. She had another two datapads for Anakin and me.Padawan Janson saluted at her and left, but not before calling out his goodbyes to us.Healer Che paused, “Have you all had dinner?” Anakin’s stomach grumbled from his bed. She took that as a negative. She gave her datapads to the junior Padawan, who returned with the vaccines and instructed him to fill them out and have them checked by the Knight.I looked over at the needles. Some of the needles were two or three-prong needles. Anakin leaned over and paled as he looked at the array of stabby things.Well, this is going to be fun.I laid face down on the hospital pillow, relaxing. It sucks having a 5 for my Constitution. My arms and ass were sore. She even drew blood from us to look for allergies. Healer Che made us take showers after eating some broth after we were given our shots. I snorted to myself. Anakin took the longest with his fascination with a water shower. After that, fresh hospital clothes were laid out in a private room set aside for us.Even though he had his bed, Anakin decided he wanted to share mine with me. His excuse? He was cold. I grunted as he elbowed me as he settled in. Shmi was in bed reading over the material Healer Che gave her about the vaccines and general information about having Force-sensitive children and her rights as a Republic citizen. Shmi and the healer spent a good bit of time filling out citizen paperwork for the three of us. Then, with a reminder to take it easy, we were left alone for the night.“Mom?”I heard shuffling and the bed dipping again. “Yes, Ani?” I grumbled as Shmi moved me from my prone position to lay back like Anakin.“What’s going to happen to you?” I looked over to Anakin, and he looked concerned for Shmi.“I don’t know, dear. But I do know that we’re safe.” She leaned over, smoothed his hair, and kissed his forehead. She also gave me one. “I do know that you both should sleep. I’ll be here in the morning.” Then, giving us another motherly kiss, Shmi pulled the blanket up our shoulders before moving to her bed.
Paused
I looked over the alert on my viewscreen.
!The Sith Master, Darth Plageuis, has noticed Anakin!
I scowled at the red notice. It wasn’t until I looked under it that I saw another one.
!The Sith Master, Darth Plageuis, has noticed You!
I cursed. This happened during the council meeting. I tried wracking my brain about when this guy gets ganked, and my mind went blank. So, I decided to use Runscript for now before bed. I can’t do anything about it. Though I did muse to myself, wondering why Sidious hadn’t noticed anything.I exited my Menu and turned on my side, facing Anakin. He was staring at me. This kid, honestly. He stares too much.“What?” I whispered to him.He shook his head and hugged me to him. I let him as I rested my head on the pillow. If we were older, this would have been taken differently from an outsider's view. But this was just a platonic brotherly-sister bond that Anakin needed. I didn’t begrudge him for needing the contact. He only had his mother in his life, and everything here was new.I deepened my breathing, and Anakin matched his breathing with mine. With that, he followed me into dreamland.

I woke up when I was given another ping.
Primary Quest Completed: Escape Darth Maul

Ding dong, Darth Maul is dead! Without doing anything, you survived the Zabrak’s wrath without fatal casualties.

Reward: Qui-Gon Jinn is saved, and Obi-Wan Kenobi is knighted.

Bonus Reward: Not rewarded. You did not fly under the radar of the Sith.
I pouted. I tried hard to train Anakin. I didn’t mean to get noticed! Honestly.
!Alert!

Darth Plageuis is dead, but now Darth Sidious knows that you and Anakin are special!
“Motherfucker!” I cursed out loud in English and ended up waking Anakin.“What?” The blonde jerked awake at my language. “What’s that mean?”“Nothing,” I grumbled to myself. I’ll teach him cursing later, not now. I need to brood.A knock sounded at the door, and we saw our healer enter with a cart with breakfast. Shmi was now waking up at the smell of food.She stopped at our bed and raised a nonexistent blue brow at me. “I hope you enjoyed your sleep. You slept most of the day away.”“Sleep, sleep, sleep the day away.” What I didn’t notice was that my Persacom was now sitting on Healer Che’s shoulder, bobbing her head from side to side.“Momo-chan!” I said in surprise. She was dressed in a miniature Jedi outfit with a hood and cloak included.“Knight Eerin came by earlier and saw your little droid. She decided she wanted to give Sumomo a new outfit.” I squealed and admired Sumomo’s new outfit. Then, I crawled across the bed to Healer Che, where Sumomo jumped into my hands.“Did you say thank you?” I asked Sumomo.“I did, Z” She beamed at me.I felt Anakin crawl next to me. He leaned over and poked Sumomo in the stomach.“Oof. Heyyyy.” Sumomo latched onto his finger and huffed at him. “That’s rude, Ani!”I quickly grab my droid before Anakin decides he wants to give her a makeover himself.“I haven’t received any new information from the council, but you’re still in quarantine for another day. I don’t expect anyone to come due to how late in the day it is. However, I did get a message from Master Jinn. He and Padawan Kenobi will be visiting sometime tomorrow.” Healer Che ushered Anakin to his bed and set a food tray on his table. I was given a light meal as well as Shmi.“Lady Skywalker, I have your documents ready to file with the Refugee Committee on Coruscant. Should the children wish to stay, we’ll file them under Jedi jurisdiction. But, for now, I suggest we wait before we do anything else until you meet up with the council again.” She bowed to us before leaving the room.Mmm, chicken soup. Wait, are there chickens?I looked at my bowl of unidentified soup and shrugged before eating it up. Anakin had no problems and was now bringing the bowl to his mouth to finish his food.I pushed my tray away from my bed and flopped on my stomach. Now what?“Oof!” A heavy weight landed on my back as Anakin jumped from his bed to mine. I used Force Push to move him and proceeded to smother the blonde with a pillow.“Exercise time!” I stopped at my murder attempt as Sumomo jumped from the bed to the food tray. I sighed and got off my brother and dragged him off the bed.Anakin groaned from the floor, but he got up. I started doing morning stretches following Sumomo. Anakin grumbled but grudgingly did it with me. We heard another knock on the door in the middle of our stretches. We looked over when Healer Che opened the door, gesturing a tall, brown-haired man in light tan robes into the room.
Master Ali-Alann's picture
He smiled at us and bowed.“Hello, my name is Master Ali-Alann. I’m the Creche Master for Clawmouse Clan. I heard about you yesterday and wanted to check up on you.”My mouth dropped open as I saw David Tennent as a Jedi Master. What the shit. Am I going to see more doppelgangers? The clean-shaven man turned to Shmi and called a chair to him with the Force.“I left a knight with Clawmouse Clan for the day, so I can come to you and answer any questions you might have. Usually, the Seekers would do this job when a Force-Sensitive child is found. However, we give a grace period for the parents to decide if they want their child to be a Jedi. That period is usually up to five years, with some rare exceptions.”Shmi looked concerned. “Is Anakin one of those exceptions? He’s nine.”The Jedi leaned back in his seat and rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “From what I can tell, the High Council might be willing to exempt him from the age rule. He’ll have a time catching up, but I believe he will pass his initiate trials if what some of the Masters were saying of his grasp of the Force.”“What’s an initiate? I heard Master Yoda say that yesterday.” Anakin said as he went over to Shmi’s bed. I followed him and climbed up the bed for a seat.“I suppose you can think of it as ranks.” Master Ali-Alann said with a smile. “Younglings are given to the Jedi from one to five or their species’ equivalent. The younglings are considered Initiates when they pass the Initiate trials. A series of tests you study and complete. Usually, this is a competency of basic Force abilities and knowledge and ability of the fundamental katas for lightsaber dueling.”He held up his hand and pulled a spoon from Shmi’s bowl towards him. He made the spoon sway from side to side and twirled it to mimic dancing before moving it back into the bowl.“Once you pass the Initiate trials, Initiates will go to the Gathering and make their lightsabers. Once they return, the Initiates are ready to be chosen by a Knight or Master to become a Padawan Learner. The Master and Padawan pair will spend years training in the Force and lightsaber combat while learning more complementary skills depending on their specialty. Once a Padawan is deemed competent, they push forward for the Knight Trials. Should they pass, they become a Knight themselves.”Shmi frowned, “What about those who don’t pass the Initiate trials?”“They merely try again. If the Initiate is not chosen as a Padawan by age thirteen, we would evaluate their skills with the Council of Reassignment. They lead and govern the Jedi Service Corps. Different branches consist of the Agriculture Corps, the Medical Corps, the Education Corps, and the Exploration Corps. These Corps go out into the galaxy, not unlike the Jedi Knights helping the citizens of the Republic. The Jedi Knights are the ones who deal with the Senate and work primarily on diplomatic missions or tasks given to us by planets who request help.”“Like Obi-Wan and Master Jinn!” Anakin said. “They were helping the Naboo when they took us with them.” He grinned at the man.“What about you?” The Jedi blinked at me, “What do you do? Are you a knight or from one of the Corps?” Ali-Alann smiled at me.“Ah, I am a Jedi Knight and a Creche Master. I felt the calling in the Force for me to take care of and teach the newest generations of Jedi from the beginning.”“Is it hard?” He laughed.“Yes, child, but the young ones make it all the better for me, even if they make a mess.”  We sat there trading stories and questions with the Master. We even manage to squeeze a story about Obi-Wan as an Initiate. Many hours passed before Master Ali-Alann excused himself when Healer Che returned with dinner for us.After eating, I cuddled up to Shmi. Anakin, not wanting to be left out, did the same. Then, not liking the silence, I started humming a song, and Anakin followed me, liking the beat. Finally, we lay in Shmi’s bed in contentment.

Reveille started blasting from speakers close to my head. I scrambled out of bed to get my running shoes on before stopping. I turned my head and glared at Sumomo, who grinned at me.Shmi had her hand over her heart as she stared at the commotion. Anakin turned over his bed, still dead asleep.“Sumomo, what time is it?”“It’s 7:00 in the morning! Time for exercise!” I heard chuckling from behind me as I was about to order her to shut down so I could take out that feature.I whirled around and saw a pale-looking Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan without his braid. I gasped and ran over to them, colliding with big Kenobi’s legs, barely reaching his hip height. He was the closest one to me.“You’re back! Welcome home!” I beamed up at both of them. Anakin snorted awake as he heard me shout.He blearily looked at us all before he did a double take. Then, a broad smile appeared as he jumped from his bed and hit Qui-Gon like a bullet.You’re bac- Where’s your arm!” He was dismayed when he looked at Qui-Gon’s left arm or where it used to be.Qui-Gon may have survived the fight with Darth Maul, but he didn’t escape unscratched. He was missing half his forearm and hand on the left side. I made a distressed sound and looked sadly from my position.He got Skywalkered. Qui-Goner?Qui-Gon chuckled. “It’s merely a flesh wound, children. No need to worry. Healer Che will give me a new one.”An image of the Black Knight from Monty Python appeared in my head. “Tis but a scratch!” I shook my head at the thought. I think I know what I’m introducing to Anakin next. Maybe I’ll corrupt the other kids with Monty Python humor.I leaned around Obi-Wan but kept a hand on him as I pointed my index finger at Qui-Gon instead, “You need to rest.”“She’s right.” A stern voice called out from behind us. We all turned to look back at the Head Healer as she tapped her foot.“Didn’t I tell you to stay in your room?” She glared at Qui-Gon. She turned that vicious glare at Obi-Wan. “And why didn’t you stop him?”“I don’t think anyone can stop him, Healer Che. I mean, look at him.” Obi-Wan said sheepishly as he pointed her fury back at his Master. Qui-Gon looked a bit betrayed. Then, Obi-Wan started backing away from her.I grinned and stepped on top of his foot with my arms wrapped around his leg. He glanced down but didn’t let my weight stop him from leaving the blasting zone. Obi-Wan held my shoulders and awkwardly walked over to Shmi as Healer Che let Qui-Gon have it. Anakin was staring at the healer with a deer-in-headlights look. He didn’t want to bring her wrath onto him. It was like he thought she wouldn't notice him if he were still enough.“Hello there.” Obi-Wan gave a bow to Shmi, who was out of bed, before lifting me onto the bed. I pouted at him. The three of us looked up as Qui-Gon was bodily pushed out of the room with Anakin left behind, watching the door close behind them. “Master.” Obi-Wan sighed. “I did warn him.”I gasped, and Obi-Wan and Shmi turned to look at me.“Obi-Wan, look!” I called Sumomo to me with the Force and put Sumomo in his hands. “Sumomo got a new outfit!” Sumomo gazed up at the other redhead before smiling at him.
Sumomo the Jedi Persacom
“Well, Sumomo, I see Bantling found you.” He smiled down at the droid.“Bantling?” Anakin said as he walked up to him.“Knight Bant Eerin. My friend. I see her stitch work here.” He gestured to the inside of the cloak at the bottom corner. A tiny Jedi Starbird was stitched neatly on the inside of the garment in magenta. “During our free time, we pick hobbies to pass the time. So I recognize her work.” He pulled out a small cloth from his pocket, and it was a handkerchief with the same Jedi symbol but in blue.“But that’s not what I’m here for. It seems that the council would like to see you again.” He smiled so as not to alarm anyone. I held out my hands to him. No way am I passing up the chance to be carried by Space Jesus.“…” Big Kenobi looked warily at me.I made my eyes wet, and Baby-Doll's Eyes activated. He crumpled.
Persuasion Check: Success!
I squealed happily as Obi-Wan lifted me. Sumomo was climbing up my hair again. I hugged his neck while giving Anakin a superior smirk, at which the blonde scowled at me. 2 to 0. Ha.“Xai-Wan.” My eyes widened as I looked at Shmi. She looked at the ground before looking at me again. I wobbled my lower lip, but she stayed firm. I whined but dropped my arms from Obi-Wan's neck, defeated. Mom powers. The Knight chuckled at me before setting me down while Anakin laughed like that kid Nelson Muntz from The Simpsons.Sighing, I decided to let it go. However, I do regret letting Anakin see that clip on Tatooine. I looked down at my bare feet before looking up again with a frown.“Are we going in these?” I gestured to the clothes Healer Che left us in.“Ah. Right. That would be a problem, wouldn’t it?”Obi-Wan walked out of the room and returned shortly with new clothes for us to use.We’re off to see the Space Wizards again.

Chapter 8: Goodbyes and Hellos

 
I was out of breath as I walked back to the Council Chambers with the others. Sumomo was safely on standby in my pocket. Curse you, tiny legs! Waiting for us at the door was Master Ali-Alann. He nodded back at Obi-Wan before all of us went inside.“It is good to see that, healthy, you are,” Yoda said as we stood before them.I looked over at Plo Koon and waved shyly at him. I grinned happily as he waved back at me. A feeling of happiness spread in the Force to the other Masters, who smiled or frowned in some cases at the unrestrained display of emotion.“Queen Amidala and Chancellor Palpatine extend their gratitude to the three of you.” Windu nodded to Shmi, Anakin, and I, “They were eternally grateful for the help during their crisis and wished to offer a place on Naboo should you choose to live there.” He spoke more to Shmi than us kids.“If Naboo is not to your liking, Queen Amidala personally offered to help rehome you with any of the planets connected in the Refugee Relief Committee that Naboo is a part of.” The Master of the Order said as he relayed the information to the eldest Skywalker.Shmi was silent as she listened to the Korun. “I…” Shmi paused as she thought about what she would say, “think it would best for me not to be homed in Naboo, if possible. The galaxy is large enough, and I believe the Naboo have enough on their plate without me there.”Mace Windu nodded. “I’ll have information sent to Healer Che. The Queen sent several planets for you to choose from.” He clicked something on his datapad before setting it down.He stared at both Anakin and me.We blinked at him. Waiting and not saying anything as we stared at him with innocent expressions. Almost earnestly. Anakin nudged me in the Force, and I nudged him back. Looks like we’re playing a game.He looks at us, and we looked at him. Moments ticked by, and again he looks at us, and we looked at him. I can almost hear the song by Weird Al Yankovic, “Trapped in the Drive-Tru.” Oh wait, I can hear it. It’s in my background music. I fought the grin that wanted to appear.All three of us ended up in a staring contest. Anakin and me versus Windu. Obi-Wan eyes went back and forth with a raised eyebrow and a crooked smile, amused at the situation. I heard from the background a female laugh and a few male chuckles. It was a good mood all around.Ha, we sucked Windu into a game without him knowing it. I could feel Anakin’s competitive aura as his eyes strained to stay open while the Master lifted an eyebrow at us. Almost like a taunt.……I felt a tickle on my nose.Achoo!I sneezed into my elbow, immediately losing the contest. I looked down in dismay before looking at my competitors. Shmi patted my shoulder in consolation.Anakin had a smirk before it was wiped from his face as he blinked.“No.” he moaned, flapping his arms down in defeat as Windu leaned back in triumph.“As I was saying.” Windu interlock his fingers. “Younglings, meet your new Creche Master. Master Ali-Alann decided it would be best if you both stayed together to make your transition easier.”Ali-Alann smiled as he nodded to us when we turned to him. “Hello again, children.”We smiled at him before turning back to the Council. I felt relief that I wouldn’t be separated from Anakin. Better to protect him if I know where the blonde himbo is.“Now is for the hard part.” Windu was stern, but I could tell he was trying to be nice about it.“To be a Jedi, you still wish, hmm?” Yoda helped.“Yes, sir. I do.” Anakin had a determined look on his face. It faltered when he looked at his mom, but he turned back and reaffirmed his choice.I nodded when they looked at me. “Yes, I want to be a Jedi.”The green Jedi Master hummed as Windu said, “Then it is best to say your goodbyes, children. But, remember, the Jedi life is not easy. If you wish to leave, we will return you to Lady Skywalker. You have choices.”The words were final but compassionate as Anakin, and I turned to Shmi. Anakin was the first to give a big hug to Shmi, and I lingered behind him. It was still odd to be considered a part of the Skywalker family, but I guess I earned it.Shmi went to her knees to look at us.Anakin wavered as he looked at her. I stood next to him as a silent comfort.“Will I ever see you again?”“What does your heart tell you?” She looked at us with a motherly look.“I hope so. Yes, I guess.”“Son, your place is here. My place, my future… is out there. It’s time to let go.” She held her hand to his cheek. “Now, be brave. Don’t look back. If we see each other again, then we will. But Ani, never let that hold you back. Remember, you’re free.”Shmi looked at me and pulled me into a hug.“I thank the stars for the time we had together, Xai-Wan. You may not think of me as a mother, but I very much think of you as a daughter.”
Oh, god.
My eyes started to water, but I blinked them back. My throat felt as if I was choking. “Thank you. I, I think of you as a mom too. I love you. Good luck in your new life.” I slipped and said the last part in English. Anakin was the only one who vaguely understood me. I gave her one last squeeze and stepped back next to Master Ali-Alann.I wiped my eyes, but I smiled at her. Anakin lingered and gave her another hug before standing next to me. His emotions were a flurry, so I held onto his hand to lend him strength. Finally, his emotional turmoil settled as he tightly clenched my hand.Master Ali-Alann patted our shoulders before he led us to the door, bowing to the Masters, Shmi, and Obi-Wan. As we reached the door, Anakin paused at the threshold. He was about to turn back to his mom, but he stopped. He took another breath, squeezing my hand before we left through the door.We heard the door shut behind us, and Anakin took another shuddering breath as we made our way to the Creche. Master Ali-Alann led the way, a silent companion while the young boy gathered his thoughts.
Achievement Unlocked!: Main Jedi Temple map unlocked, Upper Coruscant Map (Level 5127 to 5000) Unlocked!

Areas on Coruscant and in the Jedi Temple are locked until explored. 

*As a Jedi Initiate, you are forbidden from leaving the Temple without supervision. Either get a babysitter or sneak out.*
My eyebrows lifted as I looked at the last note. That won’t be an issue, but I might have trouble running if I sneak out. I let out an internal sigh at that thought. I have to think about sneaking out when I’m a little older.We walked for a while when we finally stopped at a large door. Instead of hearing children when the door opened, we heard the babbling sounds of water.I looked away from Anakin and saw a large fountain straight ahead of us and lots of greenery. Past the first fountain, I saw many more in the distance. Each fountain had different plants, as if depicting different environments. There were even waterfalls in this crazy place!“I thought we might enjoy a different scenery before we meet your age mates. How about I guide you during your first meditation?” The Creche Master smiled at our awed looks as he led the way to a waterfall to the west.As we walked, I couldn’t help but see glowing dungeon entrances and quest markers in my field of vision and further out on the Room of a Thousand Fountains map. Oh, this was going to be fun to explore.Ali-Alann sat us down at the bank's edge and had us deepen our breathing as we entered a joint meditation.It took some time, but we were both settled emotionally as the Master showed us how to let our feelings go into the Force. It wasn’t entirely gone, but we accepted them and let them go. The tension in Anakin’s form loosened as he followed the Master’s instructions before lazily floating in the Force. I likened it to floating on your back in a pool with no care while listening to the sounds of water and staring at the sky.It could have been an hour or two since we started the meditation before Ali-Alann relaxed his posture and got up. “Come. I think it’s time for mid-meal. We’ll stop by the dormitories to get you changed. Healer Che already sent me your measurements so that everything will be in your rooms. She also sent me the schedule for your next round of shots. You have a couple of them for the next couple of months.” He smiles wryly. Anakin shivered as he realized he needed more shots from the scary Healer. I bit my lip at the funny picture he made. I guess that makes sense, considering the population of Coruscant and a different galaxy’s worth of diseases.I blinked suddenly as a thought hit me. I remembered something. “Ani, what happened to Threepio?”Anakin’s eyes widened. “I forgot! He was on the ship, and we left him! I hope Padme gets him back to mom. He still isn’t finished.”“Naked, naked Threepio!” Sumomo popped her head out of my pocket.We all blinked at the little Persacom. I narrowed my eyes at her. She was on standby. I feel like R2-D2 left something out in his instructions to me about fixing her.“And who’s this?” The Master asked, cutting my thoughts on the matter.“Sumomo! Persacom to my Maker Z!” I put my hand into my pocket.“You’re not going to take Sumomo away from me, are you? I worked really hard on her.” I looked at Ali-Alann pleadingly.“Ah, a droid. You both must be very gifted if you managed to create your own droid. No, I won’t take Sumomo away. But do know if she becomes too distracting, we’ll deactivate her and move her to my quarters until you learn your lesson.”He gave a stern look at Anakin and me before smiling as we nodded our heads. Sumomo nodded as well since she didn’t want to be turned off for a long time.Ali-Alann showed us the path from the Room of a Thousand Fountains to our clan dwelling.Upon reaching Clawmouse Clan, Ali-Alann showed us our new rooms. It was like little dormitories for short people. Each room had two bunk beds for four Jedi Initiates. There was plenty of room for each person to personalize. In the middle was a small area with meditation pillows and small trunks for possessions. No desks were in the room, but it could be because the Common Area had them.Looking in our room, I noticed that there only seemed to be one other bed made beside our bunk bed. Looks like we got a bunk to ourselves. Anakin turned to me, and I turned to him.We stared at each other before we balled up our fists, “Ro, sham, bo!”“Yes!” “Yes!” I dived into the bottom bunk while Anakin went straight up to the ladder.It looks like the rock, paper, scissors game was unneeded, as we both got what we wanted.A laugh was heard as we looked back at the Master.“Come, children, you still need to get ready for mid-meal.” He walked over to one of the trunks and pulled out clothes my size. He gave them to me before pushing me to a side room that contained a small bathroom. I changed quickly but came out for help with the belt.When I came out, Ali-Alann had finished showing Anakin how to tie his belt to keep his tunics in place. He turned to me when I held the belt to him. He patiently explained the same process to me as he did for Anakin.Once all dressed, we were led out to the Common room, where we heard a soft roaring of children playing and a slightly frazzled Jedi Knight watching over them who looked in relief at Master Ali-Alann’s return. The unknown Knight bowed to him before she walked out of the room.The three of us stared in amusement at her swift exit. The Master shook his head before he loudly whistled. The sound was piercing as it cut the noise as all the younglings stared at us.“I see you drove off another Knight children. Another hour of meditation practice.” The children groaned before conceding. “We have new clanmates joining Clawmouse Clan. Anakin Skywalker and Xai-Wan Kenobi.”The children were a buzz as they saw us and were itching to ask us questions.“You’ll have plenty of time to meet them. But, for now, it’s time for food.” He herded us into recognizable two file lines of ten as we started walking to what I would come to know as the big cafeteria shared with the other initiate clans.There was a mix of foods in all shapes and sizes. I was wary as I saw a purple-colored food that looked like it was moving. Yay, space food.Anakin was much better than me as he knew what he wanted to eat. I locked eyes with Master Ali-Alann, who smiled at me encouragingly. I don’t know what food I can eat!“That’s good.” I blinked and saw blue and white.Turning, I saw someone my height. Her montrals gave her a good inch or two to the Togruta’s height.“My name’s Ahsoka. I saw Master Ali-Alann give you guys the same room as me.” She whispered-yelled to me as kids our age were to do. Luckily for her, the noise was drowned out by the other people in the cafeteria.“Neat. What’s that.” I pointed to the purple thing I was starting at that was kept in a box.“Oh. That. I don’t know. I know it moves and tastes yucky. At least that’s what Baily said.” I don’t even know who that was, but I nodded thoughtfully to Ahsoka. But wait, wasn’t this Anakin’s apprentice?I saw her babble as she pointed to various things that tasted good or yucky. It was hard keeping up with the names, but I grabbed some of the ones I vaguely recognized and what she recommended.We walked over to a table, and Anakin followed us. I looked at his plate and saw he picked the purple thing. I made a face at it as we sat down.“Hi! I’m Ahsoka, and you’re Anakin, right?” The little Togruta said happily before taking a bite of her food.“You’re very…snippy.” Anakin couldn’t explain why, but it felt like the right to say. He was also very overwhelmed by the speedy commentary Ahsoka gave me on the food.Ahsoka gasped in outrage, “Hey! I’m not snippy. I was only saying hi, Skyguy!”“What did you call me?! You know what, you’re Snips from now on!”I calmly ate my food and saw an almost reenactment of their conversation from the TV series.I froze when I saw the purple food from Anakin’s plate start moving off the plate. It was slowly making its way to the edge of the table.
Fucking space food.
“Anakin.” The two younglings were a step away from yanking at each other’s cheeks as they turned to look at me.I pointed to the purple thing I was sure was a sentient gelatinous cube. “Your food is running away.”The children gasped as they saw the runaway food. Then, from the corner of my eye, I noticed that Master Ali-Alann had his hand up to his face to cover up his laughs as he stared at our table. The other Creche Masters with him seem to be doing the same. But one of them had their hand raised and was moving it in a specific pattern. It keyed me in that I immediately clocked it as Force use.I glanced back at my table as Anakin grabbed a fork before stabbing his purple gelatin. The sound it let out sounded like it squealed its last dying breath as we stared at the dead purple jelly.“…Are you still going to eat it?” I asked in morbid curiosity.Anakin was still poking it, hoping to hear more little screams. I’m suddenly reminded of when we first fought a goblin together and how he poked its corpse to confirm it was dead. Ahsoka took her fork and did the same. Little sounds of compressed air squealed out as the food moved erratically as it ‘tried’ to escape.I glanced up again and saw the same Master trying hard not to laugh, still moving his hand at us. Some of them turned red-faced as they saw me looking at them. Then, as one, they all glanced away, trying to look innocent as Master Ali-Alann smiled at me, chuckling at his friend's antics.“Umm, no,” Anakin replied as his fork poking led to the purple slop losing its volume as it seemed to deflate with each poke. Entertainment finished, and I decided I should eat my food before it, too, starts to ‘mysteriously’ move.The other two decided to eat their food as well. Their hunger was taking over their need to play with weird food. Both still not noticing that it wasn’t the jelly that moved on its own but a Master having a laugh.A droid came by as we finished our plates, and Anakin and I followed Ahsoka to an outside area. It was like recess. Children of all ages played together to burn off the extra calories they ate.Ahsoka showed us a game using the Force. It was a push-and-pull game with a ball she pulled out of her pocket.We sat in a circle as she explained how to play. During her explanation, the circle got larger as more children of all ages came to play with us.
Mini-Game Started!

Use the Force and help Anakin make friends! 

Reward: 100 exp. Anakin becomes more open to the other children.

Failure: Anakin has a difficult time making connections to the Jedi.
I saw another meter like the other mini-game I played with the Jedi Council, but another bar appeared, and it was labeled Anakin’s morale. The instructions told me to keep Anakin’s motivation up while simultaneously playing against dozens of children with the Force. Great.Ahsoka tossed the ball in the middle of the circle, and a Nautolan boy immediately grabbed it with the Force. I immediately pushed the ball and shot it to Anakin, who barely grabbed it. Then, children whispered, and I saw Anakin’s morale bar lowered.I nudged Anakin and told him to use the Force and send it to another person. He sent it to a human girl, who caught it with glee. She sent it flying high, and I saw all the kids wiggling on their little butts as they tried to see where it would land. I sent another message to Anakin to twirl the ball and send it to Ahsoka, which he did.His morale bar went up as he heard kids laughing when Ahsoka was laid flat on her back to catch the ball. Ahsoka sent the ball flying again, and I grabbed it. I made it do loop-de-loops before sending it to a human boy. The boy caught it and made it jump up and down before sending it to his friends on the other side of the circle.The game went on as I carefully ensured Anakin’s morale stayed positive. His posture loosened, and he laughed more at the antics of everyone around him. His Force use became more intricate, and his morale stayed steady when he dropped the ball. But it wasn’t long before we heard a call.“Children! It’s time to go.”
Game Completed!

Reward:100 exp. Anakin is more open with the Jedi!
The Force felt light as the emotions around us were happy. Anakin himself was talking to a couple of boys as the ball was levitated back to Ahsoka. I grinned as two girls and Ahsoka talked to me as we made our way to Master Ali-Alann.We settle back in lines before walking back to our Common Area. We sat on the array of pillows scattered around the room as the Master sat with us.“I thought we’ll take it easy today and hold off on Force Theory for tomorrow.” He let the children cheer before saying, “But the older children are still required to take their test today.” Groans sounded from at least half of the class. That half of the class so happened to be kids around Anakin’s age. It seems that the Clawmouse clan was made up of two different age groups of ten children, younglings my age and the other half around Anakin’s age. I wonder what the other clans were like.“Anakin, you’ll be with the younglings Xai-Wan will be grouped with. Once you get caught up with the material, we’ll move you to your age group.”Anakin smiled nervously, but one of his friends he made just patted his shoulder. He calmed down as they whispered that they would help him.He clapped, “Now, proper introductions. Please introduce yourself, and we’ll start your meditation exercises. Remember, we’re doing this for an extra hour because you scared away Knight Keely.”I saw a couple of high-fives from children across the room as groans were sounded at the punishment.Ali-Alann walked us through another joint meditation, but this time with thirty of us kids. Again, the Force radiated around us as different kids’ auras brushed against us. With every brush that went by, we got an impression of their names. It took a bit, but Anakin and I could do the same as everyone patiently waited as we shared our names through the Force.Each impression gave us a little insight into the person who gave their name to us. After introducing ourselves, Ali-Alann gave us an exercise to share our favorite food. I felt a tinge of amusement from him as he shared the purple jelly that was killed.Even with my eyes closed, I made a weird face as I felt Ahsoka and Anakin’s disbelief at his favorite food. I gave them a thought and made a picture of Pho bo vien out to the group. Many of them made ‘mmhmm’ noises and smacking lips as they got a glimpse of the broth, as another child shared that they loved jorgan fruit. Many exciting foods were sent out as we all got to know each other.It wasn’t long before the meditation ended, and he told us that we had free time while he went and tested the older children. Many wished them luck as they walked out.Eleven children. A bunch of four to six years olds and one nine-year-old, Anakin, sat around for a moment as we stared at each other. Wondering what to do.“Do you guys want to watch a movie?” I piped up as I looked at everyone curiously. I just got an idea.Nine pairs of eyes turned as one to look at me. “What’s a movie?”Creepy~.Anakin, however, looked eager as he crawled from his cushion over to me.I smiled and held out Sumomo, “Hello!”Little children oohed and aww as they saw my little droid. Some of the girls were giggling over how cute she looked.“Sumomo, why don’t you play Treasure Planet for us on the wall? Someone, go turn the lights off.” Ahsoka quickly obeyed me as I set Sumomo in front of a wide-spaced empty wall. Her eyes glowed brightly in the darkness as Walt Disney’s logo appeared with sound. As I understood it in English, all of my memories were translated into Aurebesh for the kids to understand.Children gasped as they heard the word pirates in the opening narration. I settle onto a pillow as many others do the same thing while we watch Jim's adventures to Treasure Planet.By the time Sumomo turned off her projector, all of us were asleep when Master Ali-Alann returned to the darkened room with the older initiates.

I glanced at my stats now that I’m level 11. It’s been another year since Anakin and I became Initiates. We’re learning what there was to be a Jedi. With many misadventures as little magic children disrupted my plans.I would have thought being a kid would give me time to explore. Unfortunately, it was a big fat lie. Qui-Gon and Windu weren’t kidding when they said being a Jedi was hard work. I still haven’t even explored the first dungeons I found in the Fountain room. However, I was able to do some quests for Karma points. Mostly the older Jedi had quests that were chores to do around the Temple. I didn’t mind; it helped me get a layout of the Temple.In other news, Anakin, surviving Healer Che’s vaccine shots, quickly went up in ranks as he learned all he could while in Clawmouse Clan to catch up with his new friends after completing his Aurebesh literacy lessons.My lessons were a bit different. Alongside Anakin, I was tested on various courses to see what class I should be in. I didn’t want to do kid courses, so I didn’t bother hiding my intellect. It was a mistake. They put me in the bane of my existence, Beginner Astronavigation. I found the reason why so many people can fly spaceships. They start learning this shit young! The math was killing my brain. I get by adequately, I’m not fast, but the work gets finished. Obviously, I’m not the super smart Asian people look for.The history and galactic politics were only marginally better than this. I enjoy both of these subjects a lot more than Astronavigation. Though, my favorites were the Force and the physical classes.Maybe I should make another Persacom to do my calculations like an astromech droid. Just more travel-sized and cuter. Kotoko? Or maybe get a BD droid. Thoughts for later.I hit my head on the desk.“You know, you can’t absorb any of that math by hitting it with your head.”“Watch me,” I mumbled to Ahsoka as we sat in class as a Knight lectured us on Astronavigation formulas. So, five-year-old Ahsoka was a little prodigy in math that they put her in the same class as me. I had a physical year on her and thirty years mentally, yet this kid beat me in class. I glanced around and noticed a couple of other older kids from our clan with us and from others from the different clans. Anakin was in a higher class in another section of the Temple.So far, the Temple life was like a mini college back on Earth. After Astro, the entire clan had a class with Master Yoda with training sabers.Absently, I wondered if I could upload this information and absorb it through Technomancy. I looked at my terminal as I calculated the probability of that working. I made a face. Nah, to weird. Not to mention I wouldn’t know what that would do to my brain.“Alright, class. That will be all. Be sure to have your homework completed before coming back next week!” The Knight yelled out as we shoved our datapads into our bags and ran out. Our next class was on the opposite end of the Temple and up a couple of floors.“Did you guys understand that?” Baily, our Nautolan clanmate, said as he caught up to us.“A little bit. I’ll have to review everything again after Master Yoda’s class.” I said to him.Ahsoka hummed a little, “I understood it. I’ll help you guys out after class!” Baily pumped a fist as he thanked her.I smiled as I saw the little gestures I introduced to the impressionable minds around me.It was even more hilarious when we got more free time, and I gathered the kids to watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail. ‘Tis but a scratch!’ was cried out a lot that week when they got hurt by the training droids during Master Yoda’s saber class. We all giggled but refused to say anything to the Masters, even when they asked us. The only one who knows is Master Ali-Alann, who sits and watches the movies with us.I feel that Master Ali is a rebel who loves playing jokes on others. It doesn’t matter to me. I get to educate these poor unfortunate souls with Earth pop culture. Mwahaha. We even get the other kids from multiple clans sneaking in for movie time. It’s spreading!Halfway there, we meet up with Anakin and the older Initiates in our clan. We greeted each other as we made our way to Master Yoda.I really enjoy his class. So it was another mini-game for me every time we had Master Yoda’s class. While blindfolded, I see colored lights streaking across my blacked-out vision. The game ends when class ends, and it’s basically a high-score game. I had fun trying to pass my last high score without getting hit. Hearing Master Yoda’s compliments are the icing on the cake with this game.
Mini-Game Completed!: 50 EXP
“Good job, younglings. See you next class; I will.” The elderly Master said as he held his gimer stick close to himself.“Thank you, Master Yoda.” We all said to him before walking out of the class.It was lunchtime or midmeal, as this galaxy likes to say.Anakin bumped into me as we walked to the nearest dining hall, “Hey, what score did you get? I bet I beat you both.”This ten-year-old blonde himbo had a shit-eating grin as Ahsoka puffed up her cheeks.“I got 30, Skyguy. Beat that!” I determinedly looked ahead as they got into another fight over the highest hit rate.Some other kids got in the chat, saying their scores or sighing dismay at losing.“I got 40. What did you get, Xai-Wan?”I eyed Anakin. I have self-appointed myself with the duty of punting Anakin down a couple of pegs before he becomes an arrogant asshole like his canon self was.I’m not ashamed of beating little kids’ scores at anything, mainly because I get to grow up again and can use my age as an excuse. No, I’m not annoyed at all at having to learn new mathematical problems when I thought I finished math in college and totally not using this as a stress relief. What do you take me for?“45,” I smirked at him as I walked past Anakin to the lunch lines.I think I just gave him more fuel to try and beat me. Or should I say all of them, as I heard many of my clanmates murmuring about doing better next class.After that, most of my clanmates scattered as they joined up with different friends, but Ahsoka and Anakin stayed with me, along with Baily, our blue Nautolan friend, and Anakin’s friend Tru Veld who was a Teevan. I didn’t know what that was until Tru told me. His skin is silver and super flexible too. Seeing how he twisted his body made me cringe, and my metaphorically past life’s bones just ached to see him do it.I don’t know if Baily or Tru were in any Star Wars movies or the Legends books. However, I did have to field a couple of fights or struggles between Anakin, Tru, and some other kid in another clan. His name was Ferris or something. Honestly, I wish Anakin didn’t have so many problems with kids his age.Some of the fights between the older Initiates reached the point where Anakin would come crawling to bed with me like a sad puppy. Ahsoka would, at that point, jump in when she noticed we had a cuddle pile going on. I would eventually push them off me, and we had a slumber party on the floor.It’s like I have to do the Creche Master’s job to ensure all these tiny magic kids didn’t grow up with personality problems. The Jedi were of the opinion that it would resolve itself by the Force’s will. I said no to that. It took me most of the year to get all three of the idiots to get along. I basically made them do extra lightsaber lessons with Master Cin Drallig. (I had to bribe the Master with extra cookies I took from dinner for a month, I'm surprised he took the deal.) The extra lessons made them consider each other as lightsaber rivals. I don't know, it's turned into a weird frenemy relationship between Anakin, Tru, and the other one. It could be a weird boy friendship I'm not in the mood to understand. Yeah, I basically staged interventions for children as a side gig when my Jedi studies weren’t bogging me down. But, unfortunately, it’s a full-time job with these nut jobs. Maybe I should educate them more by Disney or something.I snorted as I thought about my movie sharing. Master Ali-Alann has been taking a couple of lessons from them on how to treat us kids. He had an easier time managing us to the point that the other Masters were asking for advice.Thoughts of locking multiple clans' worth of children to watch more Disney appealed to me as I took the last bite of my lunch.While I zoned out, the children around me got stuck in a conversation involving blue milk, jellybeans, and one of the Masters I didn’t hear the name of.That was a strange conversation to drop in on.I pulled out my datapad and looked at the time, and realized we had a couple of hours of unsupervised free time for the first time since I got here. And I just got an idea of how to spend it.Seeing that most of the plates were clean off, I interrupted these kids' riveting conversation.“Hey, wanna see something cool? I found something in the Room of the Thousand Fountains.”Four heads perked up in interest. I smiled.“Follow me.”Like little ducklings, all of them followed me to the Fountain Room. I took a less-traveled route to the giant greenhouse as I didn’t want any Knights or Masters to get the idea to assign more work.Entering the room, I led them to where I first saw a dungeon marker. Passing the westside waterfall, we came across a wild Knight in the grass.He still had the Padawan haircut, but it seemed to grow out an inch or so since the last time I saw him.I stopped abruptly as Obi-Wan opened his eyes from his lotus position a couple of feet in front of the level 2 dungeon portal. I had already locked Anakin in a party I made called Party of Two with Guests. It was the first time I tried out the Party Invite, I had to make a party and name it to add him. We haven't tried a level 2 dungeon, but I was optimistic that four Jedi Initiates and I could take it alone. Big Kenobi’s presence might put a damper on that project.“Hello, younglings. Up to any mischief today?”The others were stumped or wide-eyed, not knowing what to say.“Noooo….” I replied as I side-shuffled around him. The others followed me, which made us even more suspicious in his eyes.He smirked at us, “Well, I hope you don’t mind if I join you then.”
Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi temporarily joined the Party of Two with Guests

Mentor status applied to Obi-Wan Kenobi

2x Experience gained, and Enemies have a -2 Disadvantage to attacking allies while in a Party with Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I blinked at the game notice on my view screen. Well, that’s neat. Is the Disadvantage given because he’s known as the Soresu Master in the movies? I heard rumors that Obi-Wan had changed lightsaber styles last year. I wonder if we’ll see the famed saber skills from the movies this early in the game.I put my hands on my hips and sighed at him.“Okay, Big Kenobi. You can come with the cool kids this time.”“Why thank you, Little Kenobi. I’m honored, truly.” He sarcastically replied to me in the same manner. Then, he stood up and held out an open palm, which he crossed over his chest while bowing to us like we were royalty. We giggled at his silliness.“Well, what expedition are we into today, hmm?” He looked at us while the others looked at me, waiting for the same answer. I went for broke.“We’re dungeon crawling!”Anakin was excited at the announcement, and his giddiness spread to the others who couldn’t shield themselves from his Force presence. Of course, they didn’t know what I was talking about, but from Anakin’s reaction, it must be good.“Dungeon crawl-” I cut off Obi-Wan as I tugged his arm and dragged him through the portal. I was the only one who could see it as Anakin led the others behind me. If a bystander had been around, they would have seen us all disappear from view.
Welcome to Level 2 Dungeon

Vine Fall Caverns

Time outside of the Dungeon is paused for the duration of the playthrough.

Due to the presence of a Mentor, the escape option is unavailable to players.
My eyes lit up at the challenge. That does explain the 2x EXP.“What in the-” Obi-Wan turned around in circles as he took in the view. Tru, Baily, and Ahsoka were in awe as they looked around us.We were on top of a waterfall overlooking a cliff with vines overgrowing everywhere. It reminded me of the Angel Falls in Venezuela, to be honest. A series of vines as thick as my wrist grew from the ground and hung off the cliff face. It just so happened that six vines were in a row before us. I looked at my map and saw that, like any other dungeon, there were unexplored areas, but the closest indicator on my meter compass pointed north of us down the cliff face.Nearby, I spotted a chest weathered with age and covered in vines to the right of us. I jogged over to it as Anakin followed me. Obi-Wan was still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that we teleported away from Coruscant.Anakin immediately kicked the chest, and it opened. I looked at him with a flat expression as he copied the same thing Link does in Breath of the Wild. Sometimes showing video game clips to this himbo backfires on me in the weirdest ways. But, at least he didn’t do it barefoot. Meanwhile, Anakin just grinned at me as he looked inside the treasure chest.He cried out in triumph as he pulled out five lightsabers. He immediately turned one on, and a green blade shot out. Obi-Wan’s eyes widened as he rushed over, turned off the saber, and took the other sabers away from Anakin.“Anakin! Be careful! You don’t know if these sabers are stable enough to ignite. So always check if it’s been properly aligned. You never know if the lightsaber could explode or not ignite in your hand.”Suitably chastised, Anakin nodded his head in understanding. Obi-Wan looked at the rest of us, and we all nodded. He sighed.“Gather round. We shall check these and see what we can do to go home.” He directed the last bit towards me as I was the one who seemed most informed besides Anakin.I gave him an innocent look. He shook his head at me before making us all sit down for an impromptu lightsaber lesson on checking foreign lightsaber conditions.All the sabers were in fine condition as he gave one to each of us to defend ourselves.“Now, I expect to hear about that explanation, Xai-Wan.” He folded his arms and gave the signature disappointed Obi-Wan stare.“Well… This place is a dungeon. Currently, we’re outside Coruscant time, so no matter how long we stay here, no time will pass outside. So we basically have to complete the objective, which I don’t know what it is. I only know the name of the place. It’s called the Vine Fall Caverns. We usually can leave the dungeon on our own due to our experience as… children. But since you’re sort of a mentor and older than us, we can’t leave until we finish the dungeon!” I beamed at him as I finished the short explanation.“That…that does not explain anything at all. Maybe the place we’re at, but how can time not pass as we’re here?” Obi-Wan said flabbergasted.I looked at Anakin, who shrugged, and I looked back at Obi-Wan.“Different dungeons do different things. Like the one back at Mos Espa on Tatooine, Anakin and I fought a couple of goblins and giant womp rats with some swords we found, and time passed by normally when we got out. I just saw that the Temple had a couple of dungeons in the Room of a Thousand Fountains and wanted to show my friends. It’s good for learning. Not like we’ll die here.”“What,” Obi-Wan said flatly.I half smiled. I stumped the future Negotiator.“If we’re in danger of dying, the dungeon usually pops us back to the beginning to try again. Anakin and I had that done to us a couple of times every time we found a new dungeon. When we leave the dungeon, no one knows where we’ve been; sometimes, the adults don’t believe us when we tell them about it.”Obi-Wan looked at me like I was crazy, but the children around me were excited about the new adventure.“Let’s go, let’s go!” Ahsoka was bursting to go. Baily didn’t look too sure, but he wasn’t arguing. Tru, on the other hand, was worried about the potential dangers.“Don’t sweat it.” So I turned around and went to the vines. “We’ll just fight a couple of monsters or solve some puzzles. Either or.” I grabbed a vine and was about to go down it but was lifted into the air by a hand grabbing the back of my tunic.“And what do you think you’re doing?” Obi-Wan’s face was super close to mine as he stared me down.I gave him a ‘duh’ look. “Obi-Wan.” I wiggled, trying to escape his grip, “How else are we supposed to finish the dungeon if we don’t get moving? I mean, it’s sort of your fault we can’t leave before finishing the dungeon.”Obi-Wan’s look would have me scared, but we can’t die here, so it didn’t scare me at all. Instead, I just admired his pretty face until he was done with me.“I worry about the trouble you’ll bring to your future Master, Xai-Wan.” Obi-Wan sighed as he put me down. What amazing arm strength, I giggled as he set me on my feet.“We’re fineee!” I gave him a cheeky smile as I waved the others to the vines. The others were quick to their chosen vines. Anakin took off his belt and used it to secure himself around the vine like a harness and pulled his sleeves down around his hands. Then, with a yell, “Yippee!” he slid down the cliff faster than Obi-Wan wanted.I saw what he did and copied him. The other Initiates followed me, and soon we were zooming down the cliff. I heard a frustrated groan and a comment I’m sure Obi-Wan didn’t want me to hear about being glad he wasn’t a Creche Master.We laughed as we reached the ground below us, using the Force to decelerate our descent. Once on the ground, we redid our belts and waited for our Mentor.Obi-Wan didn’t disappoint. Instead of using the perfectly good vine, he jumped off the cliff and used the Force to stop his imminent death. We all clapped for him while he shook his head at us.I pointed in the direction of where we needed to go, “Onward!” So I started jogging to where the entrance of the dungeon was indicated. The others followed suit. Now and then, I would stop and find another treasure chest or item dropped on the floor.Anakin was quick to open the chests but eventually let the others kick the treasure boxes open. I sighed and did the same to the next box. Might as well join in. Small items were given, such as credits in one box, snacks, an owl figurine, and droid parts. Even Obi-Wan got a bag of expensive tea bags.I eventually started to hear battle music. I was quick to stop and lit my lightsaber. Anakin had his green blade lit and swung it at a goblin that appeared out of the bush. I shot forward with a side slash and killed the one next to it. Both enemies dropped where they stood before slowly starting to fade away. Republic credits were left on the ground in their places.“What was that!” Baily shouted as another group of goblins appeared with a couple of wolves. He hesitated for a second before slashing one goblin and jumping back.“They’re goblins! When you kill the monsters, they usually leave stuff behind!” Anakin yelled as he killed a wolf.Obi-Wan decapitated two goblins and a wolf in one swing of his blade, and Tru, next to him, got the last wolf. Ahsoka let out a war cry as she took out the last goblin.The bodies stayed for a minute or so before disappearing, leaving more money for us to pick up. I went down and started picking up my loot, and the other Initiates shrugged before picking up theirs. Obi-Wan looked down before resignedly using the Force to pick up his loot.I glanced around and saw that my clanmates were wide-eyed but exhilarated by the small combat.“Sometimes dungeons let you go when you defeat the enemies and get the treasure chest at the end, or you have to defeat the big boss at the end of the quest.”Obi-Wan sighed and looked at Anakin and me. “Are you saying that the both of you did this on Tatooine? Why were these so-called dungeons in the Temple, and no one else could find them?”I shrugged and said, “The Force is mysterious?” Nope, I’m not giving away that I’m a Gamer dropped in another universe.“I can’t see them, but I can feel them with the Force when I’m with Xai-Wan.” I blinked at that information. Is this the Chosen One bullshit I’m about to hear? I felt a wind brush me by as a tinkling of laughter echoed in the Force. No one else felt it, but Anakin had his head tilted toward me like a dog. Confusion was written on his face before he shook it away.“The Council is going to have tookas over this.” Obi-Wan pinched his nose as he said that.“Good luck getting them to listen to you!~” I sing song to him. “Adults never listen when we tell them about it. Actually, you’re the only one who knows. Even Mama Shmi didn’t believe us when we told her.”“I won’t even be surprised if you forget about this when you leave.” But, of course, I was just bullshitting about that last part. I don’t have to come clean about my shenanigans with Incognito running. Just say a bunch of things, and people will make their conclusions. The only thing true thing I said was that we did mention going dungeon crawling to Shmi, and she thought we were playing imaginary games.
Persuasion Check versus Obi-Wan’s Bullshit Detector (Refined under Qui-Gon’s training)

Natural 20 (+7) = 27 versus 2 (+5) =7

Persuasion Success!
I raised my eyebrow. That’s fucking hilarious. Obi-Wan has a +5 to his Charisma because of dealing with Qui-Gon. I guess his negotiating skills have to come from somewhere. I have a +7 to mine.Obi-Wan rubbed his chin, “I suppose if what you say is true. I will keep this to myself.” Then he pointed his finger at me and the rest of the Initiates. “I don’t want you doing these… dungeons by yourselves. I’d rather you at least,” at this point, he sighed in exasperation, “at least come find me before you go off on another adventure or even Master Jinn if you can.”“Okay, Knight Obi-Wan.” The children chimed, but I said with a thumbs up.“You got it, Big Kenobi!” He rubbed his face at me. I wonder how many times I can get him to do that.“Where are we going next?” he asked. I looked around and saw the entrance to a cavern. Looking at the compass, it pointed directly at it. I waved to the opening a football field length away.A couple of minutes passed as we walked, and we reached the entrance to the big giant cave. The entrance loomed over us as we peered into the darkness.“We’re going in there?” Tru said skeptically.“Yup.” I started marching with Ahsoka and Baily at my sides. Both of them were unconcerned. Anakin and Tru were quick to catch up while Obi-Wan walked sedately behind them. His large steps easily help him keep up with our smaller steps.The way inside the cave was dark that we all had to light our lightsabers to see. Dripping water echoed the further we walked. It was quiet, very quiet. Rocks under our feet crunched before we all heard it.
 Crack! 
We looked around, wondering what that was before the floor under us broke.
Dex Save: Failed!
Water splashed all around us as we hit the underground river below us. We bobbed up and down while our lightsabers hissed from hitting the water. All of us turned them off as we tried to get out of the rushing stream. It wasn’t until I felt a tug around my middle that I even knew we were in the air again.Coughing water, I was piled against other bodies as we slammed into a bank. Obi-Wan let out a heavy groan as all five of us children landed on him. We tumbled off of him as soon as he let go of the Force holding us together. I landed right on top of Obi-Wan's chest when Anakin and Tru rolled away from him, and Ahsoka and Baily slid down his sides. Obi-Wan let out an 'oof' when I tried to move off him, but my hand slipped, and I ended up slamming my forehead into his sternum.""Whoops,"" I mumbled into his tunic and lifted my head up to look at the other redhead. For a moment, he didn't do anything. Obi-Wan had his eyes closed as I crawled up his chest to see if he was still breathing. He lifted his head and opened an eye at me before saying, “Still think this is a fun adventure, Little Kenobi?”My mouth opened, but before I could say something, Baily shot up from his right side and shouted, “That was totally wizard!” with his fists straight in the air. The blue Nautolan was obviously the least amount bothered by the recent dunk. On the other side of Obi-Wan, Ahsoka giggled and chanted, “Again, again!” Obi-Wan grunted when the top of her hard montrals hit his ribs as she stayed where she was.Tru and Anakin didn’t look too far behind as they sat up.“What they said,” I giggled, and I laid my chin down as Obi-Wan groaned and covered his eyes with his forearm. I’ll let Space Jesus get a break before we move again. Obi-Wan grunted again when Baily laid his head down on him. Looks like we decided to use Obi-Wan as a pillow. He's a nice pillow. We lay there for a few minutes before the quiet was interrupted.A slap, slap noise sounded, and I looked at the noise. Anakin was thumping his hand against his lightsaber and flicking the ignition button. It didn’t turn on.Obi-Wan was still covering his eyes when Anakin crawled over to him and started poking his leg.“Obi-Wan.”Poke, poke.“Obi-Wan.”Poke, poke.“Yes, Anakin?” Obi-Wan didn't move his arm.“My lightsaber isn’t turning on.” The boy pouted.The other Initiates took this time to look at their sabers, and only Ahsoka’s and Tru’s sabers turned on. I decided to just chill on the warm chest.The Knight sighed before he moved the arm he was using and held it out to Anakin. When Obi-Wan sat up, he rolled me to the side right into Baily. We went 'oof' as I hit my friend as the other redhead inspected the lightsaber that Anakin handed him. As an afterthought, Obi-Wan turned on his lightsaber and was glad to see it worked. He went back to the green lightsaber to figure out what was wrong.Taking it apart, he found the problem.“Baily, let me see yours.” Baily rolled on top of me while slapping his wet sleeve into my face as he handed his lightsaber over to the older Knight, who proceeded to take it apart. I pushed my friend off of me as I got up and started to squeeze water out of my hair. I made sure to flick some of that water at Baily, who spluttered at me. He then started wringing his tunics and throwing that water at me. Obi-Wan sighed as he got hit by more water. He stopped what he was doing and looked up in the air before going back to what he was doing. Ahsoka crawled around the Knight and threw her outer tunic at our faces, stopping our fight. She laughed at our bewildered faces.“Ah, there’s the problem.” Obi-Wan carefully reconstructed both lightsabers before handing them back to their owners.“These two lightsabers don’t have a bifurcating cyclical-ignition pulse.” He chuckled before making it simple at our blank looks, “Waterproof cases, younglings. The water shorted out the sabers. We, unfortunately, don’t have any supplies to fix it. So stick close to others until we either fix it or leave the… dungeon.” The pause that he gave meant Obi-Wan was still stuck on the fact that this was happening to him.This makes me want to take him on more dungeon runs to break his brain on the impossibility.“Time to move?” I chirped at him.He gave me a look that wasn’t moved by my innocent look. Obi-Wan was getting wise to my tricks.“Yes, yes, you troublemaker. Let’s go.” Everyone cheered as we got to our feet.I got up and flicked the ignition button on my lightsaber. The blue saber shot up to show it was still working. Turning it off, I moved over to Anakin and handed him my lightsaber.“Here, Ani.” Anakin blinked before grinning and took it from me. “What are you going to use?”Using my Inventory, I pulled out my blaster and a collapsible staff, which I handed to Baily. My friend smiled widely as he started twirling his new staff.“Wait, wait, wait.” Obi-Wan was using his hands to gesture for all activity to stop.“Where did you get that, and why do you have a blaster?!” he asked incredulously.I slowly blinked at him, “I always had them. This is my blaster.” I pointed my hand blaster at the ground to check it over, making sure the muzzle was pointed at the ground.“Yeah, she had that when she fought off the slavers before coming to live with mom and me,” Anakin said with a shrug.Obi-Wan took a long breath before turning away from us. I can imagine a chibi version of himself screaming in aggravation. This was hilarious.He started murmuring, and I had to listen closely to hear him. ‘I don’t know how Master Ali-Alann does this. He’s a saint. This is like Qui-Gon but worse.’“Alright, keep your surprises,” He directed this at me, “to yourself. I rather we get a move on.”I grinned and was about to lead us through another cavern before I was tugged back to stand next to Obi-Wan.“You, Little Kenobi, are staying with me. I’ll let you keep the blaster for now, but you are not to fire it unless your life depends on it.” I let out a disbelieving sound, but he held firm. It’s like he took lessons from Shmi!“But-”“No.”“But-” I whined at him. I clutched at his tunic, pleading with him while Ahsoka and Baily started snickering at me.“No, Xai-Wan. A blaster is a dangerous, uncivilized weapon. I don’t care if you know how to shoot. You’re staying with me even if I have to carry you.”Just when I was about to argue about how exactly lightsabers were civilized when we can hack limbs apart, I opened my mouth before closing it again. Did Space Jesus say he would carry me voluntarily?Grinning, I put the blaster away and held up my arms to him. This caused him to stop.“You said you’ll carry me.” He looked flabbergasted. This conversation took a weird turn for him.Now, all four Initiates were laughing out loud.Obi-Wan rubbed the bridge of his nose and roughly breathed in through his nose and out of his mouth.“Fine.” He picked me up and settled me on his back like a monkey. I started giggling. Yes! I finally get my holy ride, no Mama Shmi to stop me.

Chapter 9: The Jedi Adventures Part 2

 
I hummed the Pokemon Johto League theme song while hanging off Obi-Wan’s back. It’s been ten minutes of me humming the various Pokemon themes, and I can’t tell if he found it annoying or not, but I didn’t care. I lost the ability to care what people thought of me in my last life à la military style.Coming at the end of the theme song, I was about to start humming the Master Quest theme when I got distracted by a glow in the corner of my eye.Part of the cavern walls we passed had glowed briefly as we passed it. Looking at the wall, I immediately saw what my Gamer Mind was telling me. One wall section was outlined in cracks like in Breath of the Wild and Star Wars Fallen Order.“Wait, wait, go back!” I patted Obi-Wan’s shoulder while looking at the wall.The Knight stopped in his tracks, “What is it?”My whole body was buzzing in excitement as I patted his back. Obi-Wan sighed as he turned around. The other Initiates were curious, too, as they followed us.“Stop!” Everyone stopped in front of the wall that was now highlighted blue in my vision.“It’s a wall.” Obi-Wan deadpanned as he looked at said wall.I huffed. I don’t need a sarcastic Space Jesus. I leaned forward, held my hand over his shoulder, and Force Pushed the wall in front of us.An almighty crack sounded as the others shouted in alarm. Then, just as Obi-Wan was about to scold me for using the Force, the wall in front of us crumbled and revealed a chest.Silence.“Secret Chest!” I cheered from my position and heard the congratulatory chime from Breath of the Wild.Ahsoka ‘oohed’ as Baily crept forward to inspect the chest. Anakin and Tru started a rock, paper, scissors game to see who got to open the chest. Tru won.“Yes!” He ran forward and immediately kicked the chest.It didn’t do anything.“Maybe it’s locked?” Ahsoka suggested.Anakin came forward and laid his hand on the lock. I felt a surge in the Force as he shifted the tumblers of the old chest and unlocked it. Then, with a click, Anakin stepped back and grandly gestured to his best guy friend. Tru kicked it again.It still didn’t do anything.I started snickering behind Obi-Wan’s back as my age mates did the same, covering their mouths as kids sometimes did to try and hide their laughs from notice. It was freaking adorable.“Perhaps you should actually open it and not kick every chest you see?” Obi-Wan said. I couldn’t see it, but I’m sure he had a wry smile.Tru scowled but did as he said and opened the chest like a normal person.Looking inside, the Teevan leaned down and pulled out a glowing blue cube.“This was the only thing inside.”The four magic kids leaned in and gazed at the new treasure.“…What is it?” Anakin asked.The cube floated out of Tru’s hand as it flew over to Obi-Wan and me.“This is a Jedi holocron. Amazing, it looks to be in pristine condition despite the circumstances we found it in.” Obi-Wan rubbed his chin as he turned the cube using the Force.“How do you open it? What if it has a secret, and that’s why it was behind the wall.” I said to incite chaos. I vaguely knew about holocrons and wanted to see what the others did with that information.Ahsoka perked up at that information.“Maybe it has a treasure map! Like Treasure Planet.” Baily, Tru, and Anakin were instantly interested in opening the holocron.“Open it, open it, Obi-Wan!” Four voices shouted as they all surrounded the red-haired Knight.“Treasure!”“We’re pirates looking for treasure!”“Open the map!”Four youthful faces stared at him unnervingly, and I felt Obi-Wan tense under their gazes.I decided to pipe in and leaned on him with my arms around his shoulders. I said, “Please, Obi-Wan. We don’t know how to open it.”He sighed, “Holocrons are not treasure maps. They’re a repository of information. Usually, they could be just lessons from the past. But, really, we should be taking this to Madam Nu.” The four faces were unmoved as they silently begged him to open it.Obi-Wan gave up. He can’t fight younglings.He sat on the floor in a meditative position, with me leaning against him and my tiptoes touching the ground. I didn’t move from my comfy position as I leaned my head over his shoulder to see him open the Holocron. The others sat down as they watched Obi-Wan open the holocron.As the corners of the holocron twisted, the faces seemed to explode, and an image of…a map appeared in front of us.“It’s a treasure map!!!” We all shouted, excluding Obi-Wan, who was rubbing his ears at the high-pitched voices.“Where does it lead?” Baily asked as he touched the holo image. His hand passed through it.
Major Side Quest: X Marks the Spot.

Solve the secrets of the hidden holocron, and may you find the adventure you seek at your peril.

70,000 Experience points and two historical artifacts.

No time limit.

[ ] Accept [ ] Decline
My eyes widened as I saw the quest information. That’s…extreme but awesome sounding.
[X] Accept
Without prompting, the game accepted the quest for me. Of course, I hope I don’t die, but I just got to last until I’m fourteen, and I can reincarnate again. Not that I’m aiming to die that soon.Obi-Wan rubbed the faint stubble on his face as he gazed at the map. None of the star clusters was recognizable. He noticed that the map didn’t do anything when Baily touched it, but wanting to see for himself; he reached forward. The map fizzled but stayed as it was. Just a large holo map of unknown star systems.I reached out to a nearby system, and the stars swirled around us before forming into words.
“[Blank]: Jedi; hero; traitor, conqueror; villain; savior. He was all these things and more. He was a living legend; the embodiment of myth and folklore; a figure that transcended history.”

Who am I?
Staring at the quote filled me with annoyance. Is this a riddle? Or some reference to Star Wars material I didn’t read when I died. Crap baskets.“I can’t read this language,” Obi-Wan said in frustration. “I never even seen this type of writing before.”I blinked and looked back at the quote.It was in English.The other Initiates with us shook their heads as well. Looking sad or similarly frustrated that they couldn’t read the ‘treasure map.’I guess I should put them out of their misery.“Blank: Jedi; hero; traitor, conqueror; villain; savior. He was all these things and more. He was a living legend; the embodiment of myth and folklore; a figure that transcended history. Who am I?” Not noticing that I was speaking once again in one of the languages of my past life.“You can read it!” Ahsoka said as she tackled me off of Obi-Wan. She was super excited that they didn’t have to give up looking for treasure.Ow. I now have a Togruta on me.“Xai-Wan, what language is this? I don’t recognize the writing system.” Obi-Wan turned around, pulled Ahsoka off me, and sat us down next to him.“Just a language I remember,” I said, trying to sidestep the complicated mess of my life when I heard a gasp.As if to emphasize his realization, Anakin hammered the bottom of his right fist onto his left palm, which was horizontal with his sternum. He looked like a fucking anime protagonist character. “That’s the language you’re teaching me!” Anakin exclaimed.Oh, right, I forgot. I taught Anakin out of loneliness and homesickness. Damn it.Obi-Wan raised an eyebrow at me. I pouted at him.“It’s English.” I didn’t elaborate anymore.“What is the translation, then?” The Knight decided to drop the subject of the unknown language. He’ll have more time to convince the stubborn little one when they return to the temple.“We’re supposed to figure out who the quote is describing.” I reiterated the quote in Basic.Now everyone had thinking faces on.Anakin thought long and hard. But, alas, it was only a few moments before he gave up. He knew the others knew more than him about Jedi history.Am I subconsciously making him more of a himbo? I can’t tell if I like this more than the broody brat he was in the Prequels. I thought about it for a split moment. Yup, himbo, it is.The other Initiates were also thinking hard but eventually gave up.Help us, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re our only hope.“Jedi, hero, traitor….” Obi-Wan mumbled as he thought about it. “Is it Tarre Vizsla? No…” he continued to think out loud while rubbing his chin.“I swear, it’s on the tip of my tongue. It sounds like a former Jedi had turned into a Sith or darksider, but he later became a savior? A living embodiment….” Obi-Wan once again started mumbling his theories to himself.It was when he had said the words Jedi turned Sith that I remembered. My husband’s favorite character.“Revan!” I excitedly exclaimed. How did I forget about that badass?At the sound of Revan, The iconic eight-note secret discovery sound effect from Legend of Zelda sounded in my ears.The letters hovering in the air swirled again before they began to render a figure in front of us.The figure was of a Jedi in a cream-colored cloak. The only difference was on top of the cloak was red-brownish armor. Two lightsabers hung from his hips, and his hood obscured his face.The man reached up and removed his hood.And it was freaking long-haired Keanu Reeves. He had weird connecting red targets on his face, but it was him.What the hell? How many damn doppelgangers am I going to find?“I am Jedi Knight Revan. I created this holocron to record my knowledge of the Star Forge from the Rakatan Infinite Empire. Unfortunately, the High Council and the Republic didn’t believe it prudent to leave information about the Rakatan Empire for future generations. I disagree. We may have destroyed the Star Forge at the Battle of Rakata Prime, but they don’t understand that it was an Infinite Empire. The Rakatans subjugated the galaxy, glassed planets like Tatooine. They can’t possibly think it was the only relic left behind by the Rakata.”Revan's voice was harsh, but none of that showed on his face.“There is no further information locked onto this holocron. Clues have been left throughout the galaxy to find for any future…adventurer.” My eyes widened as I saw Keanu Reeves look directly at me when he said that. “Should you take up this quest, be wary. Like the Star Forge, much of the Rakatan engineering was seeped in the dark side. The Rakatan created the Star Forge using dark side energies to mass produce their technology. If you are not prepared, they will twist your mind until you’re no better than the Sith. Should you come across any relic from the Rakatan, destroy it. The Sith cannot have their hands on this technology. May the Force be with you.” Revan bowed before the cube shifted and closed itself. Then, as if it were made of light, it seemed to glitter and disappear from our presence.At that moment, I got another chime notification as the holocron was deposited in my inventory. Cool, instant delivery.After the recording, the silence was deafening.“Revan. That was Revan. And, the holocron.” Obi-Wan’s eyes were still staring at the space where the holocron was.“Soooo, do we inform anyone or say nothing since the holocron is gone?” I said out loud.I stopped when I heard an unexpected noise from Anakin, who was also staring into the same space as Obi-Wan. “The-these sleemo Rakata were the ones who made Tatooine a desert? I thought the Jawas were joking when they told me Tatooine used to be a green planet.”The anger and grief poured off Anakin, no doubt thinking of all the times he had seen unfortunate slaves commanded to stand in sandstorms as punishment and the planet-wide water scarcity.Before he could stew in his emotions, I laid my hand on his and pulled him back to the present. Helping him to let go of those feelings. Tru, his best friend, saw what I did and reached out to help Anakin. A few deep breaths were taken before Anakin was okay.“Sorry,” he said sullenly with a flush on his face.“Anakin, no one will punish you for feeling what you do. So it’s okay to feel angry, just as long as you don’t let it control you.” Tru said as he wrapped an arm around his friend. Anakin nodded before hugging him back.Oh my god, Disney therapy was working. I stared at the hugging boys in amazement. I didn’t think it would work. The movies were mostly for shits and giggles.Obi-Wan was silent as he witnessed the display of emotion but said nothing of it. In fact, he smiled at me when I looked at him.“Come, let’s finish this dungeon, shall we?”Looks like everyone was going to ignore the information Revan gave us. Is this a game mechanic? Oh well. I’ll do it myself. Annnd now I have Thanos in my head. Eugh.I walked next to Obi-Wan as everyone followed us back onto the path. We hadn’t even walked for ten minutes before something else happened.A roar erupted in the caverns as a large lion appeared down the tunnel. Everyone froze in their steps as they took in the predator before them.I was about to scream like a little girl (I’m excused) before I realized something. Lions are on Earth. What the fuck is it doing here?

Ahsoka, the little hunter she is, looked prepared to face the lion herself as she snarled at it, and Obi-Wan had ignited his saber standing in front of us all. But, unfortunately, I didn’t see the boys' reaction, distracted as I was.I looked closer at the lion and realized it didn’t have a shadow for its large size. So, picking up a good-sized rock, I threw it at the lion’s head, where it phases through.When it phases through the lion’s image, we hear a growling noise that sounds like chittering. Then, the image dropped and revealed a tiny blue dragon with butterfly wings.Dumbfounded, Obi-Wan lowered his saber to take in the new creature.“It’s a dragon!” I said excitedly.I pulled out one of the pallies I had stashed in my inventory and held it out to the tiny dragon.The dragon growled a little as it flapped its wings in place, unsure of the gesture.I held the pallie up and took a small bite from the fruit. Then, swallowing, I walked closer to the (fairy?) dragon. Obi-Wan was tensed as I stepped closer, but he didn’t want to risk the creature doing anything violent. So instead, he kept his saber low but was ready to fight should it attack.“Sorry, did we disturb you? We were just exploring the cave until we came across you. I’m sorry for throwing the rock at you.” I placed the pallie on the cavern floor and stepped back as the blue dragon looked at me. Then, it tilted its head at me before landing softly on the floor next to the fruit.Waddling closer to the fruit, it took a nibble, then a bite, as it tasted the sweet flavor of the desert fruit. When the cat-sized dragon finished the pallie, it looked up at me, and I couldn’t resist it as I crouched down and gave it another pallie.“Is this your territory?” I asked it. If I’m correct, this must be a fairy dragon. Chaotic Good trickters. They usually let you pass if you’re nice to them and give them a sweet or bauble.I don’t remember much, but the dragon must be older if it can use Major Image on us.When I asked if the caverns were its territory, it seemed to wilt in place. Every one of us, Force Sensitives, could feel the misery and homesickness of the tiny dragon.“We can help you!” Anakin shouted. The dragon jumped but settled when the boy went to his knees in front of the dragon. He reached into his pockets, pulled out some candy, and held it out to the dragon. “If you want to get out of the caves, you can come with us. We’ll find your home!”Warily, the dragon looks at the hand to Anakin’s face before darting its head quickly to take the snack. The treat quickly went down its gullet before he started purring as Anakin scratched its scales.With a giggle, it turned invisible. Everyone looked for the creature but turned to Baily as he squealed. He had his arms out in front of him and had dropped his staff.“It’s on my head!” The little prankster giggled again before we heard the flapping wings, and it appeared on Obi-Wan’s head. The Knight didn’t look amused, but he shut off his saber and hooked it on his belt.

“Not again,” Obi-Wan mumbled. He left the dragon on his head as he seemed used to taking care of the unexpected.“Not again?” I asked him, causing him to roll his eyes.“I only remembered something Qui-Gon did. Several times.” He looked exasperated at Anakin as the dragon chirped from his head. It seemed to roost in his hair.Well, I hate to do this (not really), but I'm going to give him another headache.Smiling impishly at Obi-Wan, I said, “I found the quest!” Everyone looked at me questioningly. Then, I pointed at the dragon. “We have to find a way to get the dragon home. And find out why it was here and not the Fae Realm.” I half-mumbled the last part.Obi-Wan directed his exasperated look toward me. “I don’t want to know why you know that. But fine. Let’s get this adventure done with. I really want to sit down with a cup of tea.” The Knight gave me a look, and I had a feeling he wasn’t going to let any of my discrepancies slide when we got back to the temple.The jokes on him, I have smoke bombs I made on Tatooine for an escape route. Don’t want to reveal Apparition just yet. With the Force, I can run super fast.

Chapter 11: The Jedi Adventures Part 3

 
Little chirrups sounded now and then as the dragon in Obi-Wan’s hair made a happy noise. Giggles escaped our mouths when we glanced back at Obi-Wan’s flat expression.I turned around and started walking backward, asking the Force to help me not hit anything. A sense of acknowledgment fluttered around me as my feet seemed to move without my input to dodge a rock or crack that would have tripped me. Ahsoka seemed to perk up at the nuance of Force use and tried it herself. She was a little clumsy, but I grabbed her hand as we looked back at Obi-wan and the fairy dragon.The Knight looked wary at our innocent looks. I think I should make a Grady sisters' quote from The Shining.“So, friend. Can you give us any clues on how you got here?” I asked the dragon.The dragon tilted his head a bit before leaping off his perch. Obi-Wan ducked his head as he bit down the yelp that wanted to escape. The blue dragon flew around in circles before flying ahead of us and floating in place. He chirped and motioned his head to a wall.Obi-Wan’s face was a thing of beauty.“It’s… another wall.” The Knight was done with this adventure. I let out a cackle but stopped when the other redhead turned his head to me with a glare. I plastered another innocent look on my face while Ahsoka giggled at us.“Maybe you should touch the wall?” I had a feeling what the ‘wall’ actually was. Obi-Wan glanced back at the wall before reaching out. Then, when his hand was preparing to feel the solid stone, it phased through it like water.“Secret Tunnel!” I cheered. Ahsoka and Baily repeated after me with the same enthusiasm. Anakin and Tru perked in interest at the new thing in front of us.“Let’s go!” Anakin and Tru charged forward but were dragged back by their collars.Obi-Wan started mumbling about little chaos Initiates and their need to go charging in. But instead, Obi-Wan slowly stuck his head through and saw a long tunnel with little glowing mushrooms lighting the pathway.“Wow, Obi-Wan. Your head disappeared when you did that.” Anakin said with wonder in his voice. Tru nodded his head in agreement.The Knight rolled his eyes before gesturing to the rest of the party after him as we passed the illusion.The blue dragon chirruped quietly as he landed on Anakin’s head. Everyone felt the fae’s wariness the further we walked. Finally, reaching out, Tru rubbed the dragon’s scales to comfort him. The dragon purred and hopped over to Tru feeling light-hearted.It may have been ten minutes before we saw a long walkway stretched across a large cavern at the end of the tunnel. As we were about to walk it, we started hearing loud noises that seemed to flow up to us. Obi-Wan stopped us all before we could leave the tunnel and crouched down to eavesdrop.“Find me that dragon! Do you know the number of components I used to summon it?! And now you’re telling me you lost it!” The sound of glass shattering echoed in the cavern.Peeking over the ledge, Obi-Wan saw five humanoids standing around tables full of scientific equipment. One of the beings was behind the center table while four others were cowering before him.“S-sorry boss, That beasty popped out, and I know you said not to touch anything-”“But you did! I had that circle prepared. All you idiots-” Another vial was thrown at their feet, which the minions hastily dodged. The floor hissed as the neon-colored liquid ate at the cavern floor. “-had to do was wait there with the cage I prepared for you! But no! One of you idiots erased the chalk array, and it flew off!” The leader growled as he paced the distance from one table to another.I inched my way around the others slowly to see what was up. Just as I was about to take a peak, Obi-Wan used his hand to press down slowly on my head, making me crouch down and away from the ledge.Meanie. I silently puffed my cheeks at him. In response, his hand got heavier, and I got squished into his side. I flailed a bit, and I could hear from the peanut gallery the silent laughter of my so-called friends.
How rude. 
I looked over the ledge from my vantage point under a smelly armpit. What I saw was surprising. It was an actual alchemist. No shit. I glanced over at all the vials on the leader’s person and the rucksack on his back. He looks exactly like the elven Alchemist the D&D 5E published. And the minions are exactly what I pictured typical thugs to look like in a fantasy game. Leather armor and ugly looking. Huh, a couple of maces and a few heavy crossbows as weapons.And they just so happened to be around volatile mixtures.I love my Scan ability.Just as I was about to scan the cavern, a whisper seemed to flow past my ears.
Down.
Looking down at my feet, I slumped against Obi-Wan so that he could hold me, just to be weird. I could tell he didn’t expect it, but he quickly held tight to me as I spotted what I was directed to look for.A rock.The slow creeping of a smile appeared on my face with no one the wiser. I used the Force and felt more than see Anakin turn to look at me in surprise. Then, before anyone could stop me, I launched the small pebble at the alchemy table, which was glowing blue in my vision.It crashed into one of the beakers spilling its contents onto piles of parchment while the forward momentum hit the other vials as lights and sparks erupted. It was like thermite burning on the Fourth of July. Or Angry Birds.“No!” The Alchemist tried to stop the chemical reaction, but it was too late. The best he could do was use Mage hand to push his experiments away from him before jumping out of the way.“Oooh.” My Initiate buddies stared in awe as many of the mixtures lit up in pretty colors. Unfortunately, the entirety of three tables worth of experiments was ruined by one rock.A wave of visible anger was seen on the Alchemist as he stared at what must have been months or years of research go down the drain. His minions were cowering behind him.His anger was a thing of beauty. Is he going to hulk out? I mused to myself.The following action he took surprised me. He pulled out a helmet and put it on.
Ah shit. He’s an Artificer. 
He raised his head and turned to face us directly.When I say directly, I mean directly. The bastard has fucking Winged Boots! The elven man rose into the air and immediately launched something at us.My Scan ability says that he has the Helm of Awareness. Advantage on initiative rolls and can’t be surprised unless incapacitated. I bet he wished he had that on before I wrecked his shit.Just as Obi-Wan was moving me and using himself as a shield for the others, I held out my hands and conjured my Force Bubble to protect us. (Force Shield? Nah, bubble sounds more fun.)The 20 feet radius around us was engulfed in flames as the bomb ignited on contact.
FP: 190/210

There goes a small chunk of my powers.
I pulled out my blaster and shot the elf on a shelf.
1d10 = 8 Piercing Damage
“Rggh. Get them!” He shouted to the thugs. Three immediately began loading their crossbows while the others readied their maces and put a mean face on. How cute.Three bolts fired at us and were immediately deflected by Obi-Wan. My Knight in robey armor.With Ahsoka and Tru's help, Anakin held their hands out and Force Pushed at the Alchemist.
3d4+3 = 1+4+3=11 Force damage 
Huh. That’s interesting to note. They just did an equivalent of Magic Missile using the Force.While I was pondering how exactly they could do that and if the others could join in to level up the Magic Missles, Baily did something I didn’t expect from him.He threw the staff I gave him at the Alchemist. It hit the elf square in the stomach before being yanked back to little hands with the Force. 1d6 = 4 Bludgeoning DamageBaily gave us a thumbs up and a Kit Fisto smile. But, oh god. Is he going to be like Guy Sensei or Fisto, AKA Fish Daddy?Shaking my head off the random thoughts, I used Scan again to see where we were at.
Artificer Alchemist level 14: 82/105 HP

Thugs x5: 32/32 HP
“You!” The Alchemist pointed in Tru’s direction, causing him to eep. “That’s my component. Give it back!” The elf snarled in our direction.Said dragon disappeared as it cast Invisibility on itself. Feeling the dragon take flight, Tru decided to stick his tongue out and pull down an eyelid.“Blegh!” We all snickered while Obi-Wan had a slight smirk on his face.“I believe our friend disagrees, dear sir.” Obi-Wan launched himself into the air with a crouch and took two swipes at our opponent. Not to the Alchemist himself but to his rucksack. Both Knight and the sack went down, only for the bag to land on one of the thugs knocking him down. Yikes, that guy seems to have a glass jaw if that knocked him out.Meanwhile, Obi-Wan rolled to a stop and popped up in a Soresu stance.”Hello there.”The redhead said casually as I squealed in my head at that one-liner. I half-wished one of the thugs to say ‘General Kenobi’ back at him.“My notes!” With a grit of his teeth, the Artificer held out his hand and yelled something as a shimmering orb started forming around Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan’s Dex Save 17+4=21

DC 16 = Success!
Before the orb could enclose around him, Obi-Wan Force Pulled a thug towards himself before using him as a springboard to backflip out of the spell’s range. Thus trapping one of the crossbow thugs.I released a low whistle at the display before taking another shot at the elf man.
12+0= Fail

Shit.
Two of the crossbow thugs turned and shot at us, sadly missing us entirely. The other thugs ran at Obi-Wan only to swing and miss when the Knight merely cut the head of their maces.This time, Anakin, Ahsoka, Tru, and Baily aimed and used the Force for another Magic Missile. Again, four bolts came out this time and hit directly at the menace in front of us.
4d4+4= 2+2+2+2+4 = 12 Force Damage
Just as we were preparing for another attack from the enemy, a puff of gas erupted from a now-visible faerie dragon five feet away from the elf. It looked like it was working, but the Alchemist grabbed at the dragon and used Shocking Grasp to shock the poor creature by the wings.
1d20+8 = 11+8 = 19 Success

3d8 = 2+1+8 = 11 Lightning Damage

Faerie (blue) Dragon: 3/14 HP
With a quick bite, our blue friend released himself from the grasp and fell with a thud on the cavern floor. Everyone uttered gasps, excluding the thugs and Alchemist, as the dragon weakly flapped its damaged wings.Two of the crossbow thugs were about to launch themselves to collect the dragon but were met with resistance as Obi-Wan defended the down creature, and he slashed through the thugs’ weapons.The mace users threw their broken weapons down and tried to punch the Knight, only to miss.The group of Initiates with me exploded with untold fury as our small companion was struck down. However, that fury was channeled into a more powerful Magic Missle for their age and levels. Anakin no doubt helped by acting as the fuel for the extra missile. With the careful aim that the Force aided, Anakin directed the missiles center mass of our foe.
5d4+5 = 4+3+2+1+3+5 = 18 Force Damage

Artificer Alchemist: 52/105 HP
Instead of doing the same thing as the others, I looked down at the cavern floor and judged the distance. Then, using the Force, I lifted the little guy and caught him softly in my arms. Moving back, my fellow Initiates moved forward and shielded me from view.I knelt down with my blue friend in my lap and started singing Rapunzel’s Healing Chant.
Faerie (blue) Dragon: 6/14 HP

FP: 140/210
My body felt numb as I did the small amount of healing support. I seemed to only have enough Healing abilities for the equivalent of Healing word, just without any WIS points added as bonus healing. Being small sucks.“A Cleric acolyte? Well, now I know which is the first one to go!” He rapidly flung acid at me using a slinger for a multiattack.The first vial of acid hit me in the arm as I hissed in pain, and my Chant was disrupted. The second vial was missed by a wide margin.
2d6+4 = 3+3+4 = 10 Acid Damage

HP: 150/160

Concentration Check for your Chant!
I paled a bit as I realized my CON is a -2 for the Regression Disadvantage.
CON Check: 3-2 = 1

Spell Fails!

Faerie (blue) Dragon: 3/14 HP
I cursed as the yellow light around myself and the dragon faded, and the Healing I did was undone. Little blue chirped sadly at me as he laid his head weakly on my wrist.Unexpectedly, gurgling screams erupted as Obi-Wan used the Force to speed through his kills like the Haste spell. The only one left was the crossbow thug in the sphere.It wasn’t visible to me, but Obi-Wan had a scary look on his face when he heard that I was being targeted with the others as collateral.The elf sneered at him.“Ah, a dashing knight comes to the rescue, hmm?” The spell around the last minion was dropped as the thug aimed at Obi-Wan’s back.“Obi-Wan!” Everyone yelled out in warning, but it was unneeded as the Knight, without turning his back, twirled his lightsaber and broke the bolt in two before it could hit. Then, with a Force Push, Obi-Wan shoved the thug, and he hit the cavern walls and didn’t get back up again.“Only someone without remorse can target children.” Obi-Wan started with a look in his eye.Without even being able to see him, I started mouthing to myself with a confused look. Is Obi-Wan starting a hero monologue?“Bah, you hero types are all the same! All I wanted was somewhere to do my research. I even traveled to different planes to do it!” The elf seemed like he was preparing himself for a rant.Obi-Wan seemed ready to let the guy have his evil monologue when the other kids decided they didn’t want to wait.Another charged Magic Missile laid a whopping 24 Force Damage against the elf.I decided to get into the group effort and help give another 4 points of Force Damage aimed directly at the guy’s dick for the acid damage he dealt me.A squeak came out as he doubled over in mid-air. While the boys with me crossed their legs, Obi-Wan decided to use this to deal the last 24 points of damage left in two strikes. Deep cauterized wounds appeared as the elf lost control of his boots and fell to the cavern floor dead.The Victory Fanfare sounded in my head as the boss music changed to suit the settings.Uncaring for the now-dead body (excluding the Winged Boots), I started the Healing Chant again. This time uninterrupted.Three agonizing minutes and 11 health points to the dragon were rewarded for singing a Disney song.
FP: 0/210

HP: 140/160
I sat back in a slump as my Healing ate at my health. So that’s what Force exhaustion feels like. I rate it zero out of ten. Never do it again.“Xai-Wan!” as gently as possible, Obi-Wan moved the dragon to Tru and started a health check on me. “That was a reckless thing for you to do. You could have killed yourself by healing our friend.” Once he saw that I was only exhausted beside the slight burn on my arm, the Knight stopped fussing.“We’ll have to visit Healer Che about your arm. As well as inform her about your ability.”I whined.“It’ll be fine! I just have to nap, and it’ll go away.” I pouted while acting like the child I was. “And why do we have to tell Healer Che anyway?”The man didn’t even have the decency to tell me why. Did I annoy him too much?“Are the rest of you all right? How about you, my friend?” Obi-Wan asked the others and the dragon.My friends pipped up that they were fine, happy to let me get in trouble or, in Anakin’s case, escape Healer Che’s needles.The blue fairy dragon flapped his wings and stretched like a cat before waddling up to me and nuzzling my hand.“You’re welcome!” I cooed to him. “That mean guy isn’t going to get you anymore! We’ll have to find a way to get you home now. I wonder if he has anything in his backpack that would help?” at that question, everyone leaned over the ledge to look at the little massacre we made.The thugs had disappeared, leaving behind loot, and the Alchemist was also gone. Sadly the Winged boots disappeared with him, only leaving behind his rucksack.Drat.“Aww, he took his boots with him.” Anakin voiced my disappointment. The others also released a sad sigh when they realized the same thing.Obi-Wan rolled his eyes. “And how exactly would you use them between the five of you? We don’t even know how they worked.”“We could have shared!” Ahsoka insisted.“Yeah! And showed everyone else back at Clawmouse Clan too!” Baily shouted.Without anyone noticing, Tru had taken this time to use the Force to pull the discarded rucksack and the loot towards our party. At the same time, his fellow Initiates stated how valuable the ability to fly would be with lightsaber duels. Unfortunately, I was too busy giving a dragon head scratches.“Got it!” Everyone turned and saw the bag and the loot Tru had brought. Then, just as Tru was about to open the rucksack, he froze as he glanced at the stern look Obi-Wan gave him.He folded like a wet paper napkin.Now in possession of the bag, Obi-Wan gave it a curious look at the strange vials strapped to the sides.Using Scan, I looked at the vials. I made a face. A lot of nonsense to me.“I think we should toss the vials. That elf guy looks like he was the only one to drink those.” Before the Knight could comment on how this will no doubt be on the growing list of things to confront me over with, Anakin decided to be the next chaotic agent in the group.He grabbed the vials.And threw them over the ledge.All in one spot.Obi-Wan was left gaping at what the 10-year-old had done that he almost missed what happened next.A loud ‘Whoosh!’ echoed in the chamber before we all leaned over to see what Anakin did.Hanging in mid-air was a portal about the size of a door with a different environment on the other side.Looking at the portal, we all doubled back and looked at Anakin, who was very proud of what he had done.“The Force told me to do it!” He said gleefully, no doubt happy to cause a mess at the Force’s blessing.“T-the Force..?” Obi-Wan placed his face into his palm and took a deep breath. “Never mind, what new thing is this?” He looked directly at me but looked away when the dragon let out a triumphant tiny roar.The blue dragon soared in the air and circled a couple of times, chirping at us before diving through the portal. Once he was through, it closed behind him.

Sweet. I peered over Obi-Wan’s arm into the bag and saw it was empty. I frowned before dumping everything out of the bag.At first, nothing happened before a few items fell out, and the bag disappeared in front of us.A couple of diamonds and rubies fell out of the bag, a crude gas mask made from metal and leather, and tiny purple cubes of granules that would dissolve into any liquids, making it taste like wine.I thanked my Scan ability even if I looked dubiously at the purple cubes.Bending over, I grabbed the gas mask and threw it over the ledge. We don’t need that shit.I divided the diamonds and rubies among ourselves, along with the credits. Ahsoka, Anakin, and Obi-Wan got a diamond, while Tru, Baily, and I got rubies. I pretended not to hear Anakin and Tru's plot about making a ray gun with their gems. Obi-Wan was a step away from taking both of their spoils away from them.He gave it up as a lost cause.I quickly put my ruby away while Ahsoka started to chew on her diamond, making a faint clinking sound. Baily stared at everything through his ruby, twisting the gem and ooohing at the view.Once everyone put their loot away, I tried to sneak the purple cubes, but they were swiped away by the other redhead.“Oh no, I see that look. What exactly are these young lady?” Obi-Wan started wagging a finger at me.“They’re purple cubes.” I beamed at him innocently.It was a battle of wills as I smiled at him, and he glared back at me.I started wilting when he didn’t back down, and I didn’t feel like abusing my Baby-doll Eyes on Obi-Wan. At least for now.I heaved a giant sigh and gave in.“So you can put one of these in any liquid, and it would taste like wine. I wanted to try it.”Obi-Wan glanced at the cubes before he shoved them into his pockets when the other Initiates started to give him the same eye gleam I had.“None of you are old enough to taste wine.” He gives us all the stink eye. No matter the puppy eyes directed at him, the Knight didn’t budge.When I was about to give an argument that kids in France drank wine (in a country he didn’t know, let alone the galaxy), a sound distracted me.A glowing green circle appeared at the other end of the walkway from the secret tunnel we came out of. I guess The Game took the save point out of Kingdom Hearts.Obi-Wan had a tired look on his face. “What is that?”“That’s the exit,” I said casually.He did a double-take. “What?”“We can leave now!” Anakin said.“Thank the Force!” Then, Obi-Wan started bustling us to the portal. “How do we get back?”“Just get in the circle.” Once everyone was standing at the save point, I held out an imaginary radio in front of my face.“Welcome to Green Circle Teleportation Lines, where the grass is always greener. Please keep your hands and feet inside the circle and hold onto your buttcheeks! It’s going to be a super ride home!” Just before Obi-Wan spoke out, I tapped the notification in front of me.
Exit Dungeon?

[X] Yes [ ] No
The Rainbow Road theme from Mario Kart played in my head for the few seconds that occurred when leaving the Dungeon and arriving back at the Temple.A swooping feeling envelops us as if we had just gone down a large hill on a rollercoaster before we appeared right back in front of the same waterfall where we met Obi-Wan.“Yay! We’re back!” I clapped my hands in front of us and congratulated everyone on their first party dungeon crawl.As everyone tried to get their bearing, barring Anakin and me, we heard a voice call out to us.“Obi-Wan! There you are. I didn’t realize you invited some younglings to our meditation today.” Master Qui-Gon Jinn was walking toward us with a pleasant smile.I looked at my Gamer HUD to check the time. Well, the time didn’t move as the dungeon title said. Which means we still have a few hours of break time.“Master!” Obi-Wan had a crazy look in his eye that I didn’t particularly appreciate as he looked at Jinn and back at me. Oh crap. I nudge my friends with the Force to get ready to run.“You wouldn’t believe what happened to us. In fact, Xai-Wan was about to explain to me precisely what had happened to us. She can explain everything to you as well.”Both of them turned to me. One with expectation and the other with a curious look.I looked around at the others and saw them smile at me in ready.Looking back at the Master and Knight, I said, “You’ll never take us alive!”I yelled out and pulled a couple of smoke bombs I had in my Inventory and threw them at the ground.Smoke billowed up and covered our escape with childish giggles erupting from the five of us.“Gah!” As my friends escaped, I was yanked back by the back of my robes.Anakin, Ahsoka, and Tru ran like hounds were after them, and Baily swam away using the lake and waterfall behind us.Unfortunately, I was too slow and hurt to use the Force to aid in my escape.Qui-Gon’s amused face looked at me as Obi-Wan held me out to him like a disobedient puppy.
“Crap-baskets.”
Despite my speaking in English, Obi-Wan shook me a little when he caught me using profanity.

Chapter 12: The Force Say What??

 
Blue eyes looked at me amusedly as I hung in the air by my white Initiate tunics swaying as Obi-Wan shook me for my language.“Where in the world did you find smoke bombs, Little Kenobi?” Qui-Gon’s lips tilted up as he used Obi-Wan’s nickname for me.I started humming and swinging forward and back from my hanging position, ignoring the question.But then, I felt my body freeze from the backswing before I was straightened and forced to look Jinn in the eye. I gave Obi-Wan the side-eye at the excessive use of Force, but inwardly I cackled. I think I bugged him enough to piss him off.Qui-Gon had a twinkle in his eyes as he, too, noted Obi-Wan’s Force use.“Hmm, nothing to say, huh? What exactly was it that Obi-Wan wanted you to confess?”Giving him a stubborn tilt of my chin, I said, “I plead the fifth.” And crossed my arms in what I was pretty sure was comical considering my position.Two pairs of eyebrows rose in question. One in front of me and one I couldn’t see behind me.“And what exactly is this fifth that you plead, Xai-Wan?” Obi-wan said bluntly, clearly done with my bullshit.I grin, “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb-”My English speech was cut off by a loud squeak when I was poked in the side. The offending limb was Obi-Wan’s other hand that had reached out to do said poking.I tried to give him an offended look but couldn’t twist myself around, so I huffed at him.“Hmm.” Obi-Wan reached out and poked me again, taking care to do a running tapping on my sides, and I started laughing my head off.“St-staaahhppp! This is cheating!” I tried to break away, but all I ended up doing was wiggling and swinging my limbs to bat away the tickling Knight.“I think not. You know what you have to do to stop this Initiate.” Obi-Wan calmly said. He wasn’t even straining from holding me up and tickling me. I know for damn sure he was using the Force to hold me up.“Evilll!” I yelled out at him. That only made him more vindictive as he targeted my other side.I turned my head to Qui-Gon and gave him my Baby-doll eyes. The Master laughed deeply (I’m pretty sure Baby-doll eyes didn’t work on him, it was just pity) as he reached out and took me away from the other redhead.Laughing out of breath, I lay against the man as he sat down on the earth with me in his lap. I vaguely could tell Obi-Wan sat down next to us as I tried to catch my breath.Lifting my injured arm, I showed it to Qui-Gon. “I’m hurt.” I gave a full pout towards him and wobbled my bottom lip like I had seen my nephews do at this age.Eyes widened, “I see.” He sat me up and inspected the wound. Then, reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a roll of bandages and a tub of something blue.“This is bacta,” Qui-Gon explained as he noted my wondering look as he lifted my sleeves and cleaned my wound with an alcohol wipe. I hissed at the sting as his large hands held my arm still to wipe away the leftover acid from Alchemist’s attack.“Do you always carry supplies with you?” I asked him, curious.He quirked a brow at me, “Well, I seem to always be in the presence of younglings or Padawans that have become hurt. So yes, I do.” He sent a smile at Obi-Wan, who flushed red at the mention.“Now,” he finished applying the cool gel on me and wrapped it up nice and snug, “what is it that Obi-Wan wants you to confess, Initiate Kenobi? And how did you get hurt?” Qui-Gon gave me a stern look.Huh, never seen that look on him before. I stared at him as he continued looking at me.I started squirming as he continued the stare down, not at all prepared for it, especially from him. I felt like minutes were crawling by as the Master stared me down, waiting for me to confess.Well, this is uncomfortable. I hate staring at other people's eyes. Cultural differences suck.Ugh, I’m glad my past mom never did this to me. I was too much of a nerd that I was only afraid of bringing bad grades home or doing something stupid for her to beat my ass. Two things I had never done, only my sisters and brother. Now that I think of it, I was like a typical middle child. Like Malcolm in the Middle. The only thing they had on me was that I died long before they did.Now, I’m sad.As I contemplated the hand dealt to my siblings and me, Qui-Gon’s stare got even harder to look at before I caved in.“I took Obi-Wan and the others dungeon crawling!” I blurted out as Ultimate Dad’s look disappeared and was replaced with a look of bewilderedness.“Dungeon crawling?” Qui-Gon looked like he wanted to question life as he said this out loud.“I can see dungeons that the Force put around me, and I can enter them. To do fun stuff.” An eyebrow quirked up in front of me.“And free stuff!” I pulled out the ruby from the loot we got, “Obi-Wan got the cubes that can make any liquid taste like wine. I wanted to try some, but he took it from me even though he got the nice tea leaves.” I pouted at the Master. The other eyebrow went up when he registered what I said.“Wine, you say?” An interested glint appeared as Obi-Wan gained an exasperated look, “What kind of wine would you say, Obi-Wan? Alderaanian or Nubian?”“Master, are you not questioning the rest of the things she just said?” Obi-Wan said with a tiredness that was unfitting to his young age.“Ah yes, the tea.” Qui-Gon directly another look at me, “You said he got a nice set of tea leaves, did you not?”“Masterrr.” Obi-Wan looked like he was developing a tick on his forehead.“Obi-Wan, you must share with me these new things you have.” Qui-Gon looked like he was having the time of his life messing with his old Padawan. I started giggling at the exaggerated talk from both Padawan and Master banter.“Come.” He got up from his sitting position to his feet with me in his arms.“Master!” Obi-Wan was quick to follow him. “Where are we going?”“Why to my quarters, of course. It’s been a while since you moved out. It’ll be nice to have tea instead of meditation, no?” Qui-Gon speed walked out of the giant greenhouse as I peered over his shoulder to the other redhead.I giggled as I got them both distracted from me having to explain the dungeons. I knew I would have to explain it sooner or later, but this was more fun.I lied.This is not fun.I’ve been outmaneuvered and betrayed.Pouting over Qui-Gon’s shoulder, I refused to look at Obi-Wan’s smug grin as we were again before the Jedi High Council.I was too busy making faces at Obi-Wan that I didn’t notice that we were taking a familiar path instead of going to the residential area of the Temple.Big Kenobi distracted me!I mumbled, annoyed, so I thumped my face into the Jedi Master’s shoulder painfully. Jinn twitched but did nothing but rub my back.Unconsciously I relaxed as I pouted further. But, ugh, I can’t stay mad. I love back rubs.“Qui-Gon, is there a reason you kidnapped Initiate Kenobi and brought her to us? Shouldn’t she be in lessons?” Mace Windu’s dry voice sounded behind me.I started to tune everyone out, feeling tired. No doubt, because I was low on FP. Which reminds me, I looked at my Gamer HUD.
FP: 10/210
Lame. Am I only regenerating the Force at 1 point per minute?I yawned and tucked my face more into Qui-Gon’s shoulder.As preoccupied as I was, I didn’t notice that Obi-Wan ratted me out in my tired state.“Xai-Wan.”Hmm?I blinked and noticed how quiet everything was. I lifted my head from where I buried it and saw everyone staring at me. Some with incredulous looks or pondering faces.“Why are you staring at me?” I tried to act innocent.I was then lowered to the ground. I looked dismayed at Qui-Gon, who stopped rubbing my back before I lowered my shoulders in defeat. Damn it, I want back rubs!“Give it up, Little Kenobi. I already told them what happened when you took me ‘dungeon crawling.’” Obi-Wan gave me a slight smirk, no doubt happy with the bit of retribution.A split-second thought crossed my mind.“I only did what the Force said I could do!” I made sure to give it an extra whiney-kid tone blaming the entity.“And what was it the Force said you could do?” Depa Billaba seemed to inherit her Master’s eyebrow raise.“I’m supposed to train to be stronger, and Anakin too. So I thought it would be better to bring our friends to train too.” I shrugged. “The Force didn’t seem to mind.”More skeptical looks were given to me.“And how exactly was it that these ‘dungeons’ were in the Temple, and none of us could find them in all the generations we have been here?” Ki-Adi Mundi questioned my logic.I put my fists on my hips, “Maybe you didn’t trust the Force enough to see them. You don’t see the ghosts in the Temple either, so it’s only reasonable that you can’t see the other things the Force has to show.”“Ghosts?”“There’s no such thing as ghosts, young one.”“Really, you saw a Force Ghost?”Multiple similar exclamations erupted, and one intrigued question voiced by Qui-Gon sounded.Looks were given to Qui-Gon, questioning his sanity.I turned to Qui-Gon, “There’s one in the training salle that Master Drallig uses, and I think I saw one in the Archives. But I couldn’t see them since they like to disappear when I turn the corner.”“I think we should call Healer Che.” One Councilor commented concern for my mental health.He was subsequently ignored.“I didn’t get to talk to the Archive one. I think they’re not used to people seeing them.”Qui-Gon nodded his head thoughtfully as he took my comment seriously.“Are we taking this seriously?” I heard someone else question out loud.I heard a thump that echoed throughout the chamber and turned to see Yoda staring at me.“Distract us, you will not. The truth, you will speak.”I frowned at him. “I am telling the truth. There are ghosts in the Temple. They liked teaching so much that they stayed to see everyone…Most likely.” Yoda frowned at me.I frowned back at him.“Alright. I can see the dungeons because,” here I paused and pulled something out of my Inventory.“Ima-gi-nation!” I used 5 FP to use my Static and made the rainbow glitter (that I liberated from craft time) float the way I wanted to in a rainbow shaped as Spongebob did.I had put my hands in front of my face and fanned them out in the rainbow arc as the glitter stayed in the air by static electricity.“And the Force!” I gave a cheeky grin to everyone. I was super pleased and waited for Forever to use that line.I heard Qui-Gon muffle a laugh as I watched Yoda’s perplexed expression. Mace Windu looked constipated as he didn’t know whether to laugh or look stern at me.“And she does that!” Obi-Wan said accusatorily at me.Then, like a breath of fresh air, I heard Space Jesus’ exasperated voice again. “I don’t know how, but she manages to have multiple items that shouldn’t possibly fit in her pockets.”I gasp and let the glitter float down a little before making it disappear back into my Inventory.“Are you upset that you couldn’t have a pallie because I gave them to the Fairy Dragon?” So I pulled out another pallie.“Here.” The Knight gave me an unamused look as I poked his hand with the pallie. That didn’t deter me, so I started poking his hand incessantly until he took it.“Anything is possible with the Force,” I repeated Yoda’s mantra sweetly to him like butter won’t melt in my mouth as he took the fruit.He glared at me, “And you’re an impossible child.”I brighten, “Thank you, Big Kenobi!” He spluttered, unsure how to take that.“…How did you do that? What else are you hiding, Initiate?” Windu cut through my theatrics.I blinked at him. “Force Shenanigans.”Here another tinkling laugh was echoed through the Force. The feeling of joy erupted when I said shenanigans.“See! The Force agrees!” I yelled out, vindicated.Every Jedi looked unnerved as they felt the truth in my statement but still were skeptical of my claims.“She also has a blaster and who knows how many smoke bombs,” Obi-Wan said calmly as he looked at the pallie in his hand like it was an everyday thing and took a bite out of it.I gave a scandalous cry, “I do not! Take that back!” I even emptied my pockets to show how empty they were.The Force rang out falsely, and I looked betrayed again. “I don’t have it in my pockets.” I amended as the Force fluttered truth to everyone in the room.I mentally moaned at the Force for making me admit that. In reply, I felt a patronized pat on the head by the unseen cosmic force being…thingy.
Trust.
A frown almost appeared on my face when I heard the Force. But how would I do shenanigans?…Some Trust, then. The Force amended with a laugh which was felt by the older Jedi.“A blaster?!” Some of the Councilors looked ready to scold me or order me to give up my weapons.I gave a hmph before I started emptying my Inventory of the non-child things.A blaster, a couple of dozen knives, and other miscellaneous weapons were piled on the floor with my leftover smoke bombs. Incendiary bombs I kept in a separate pile while pulling out their fuses. (I made sure to have one of each still in my Inventory.)Every face was stunned as they looked at the pile that couldn’t possibly fit in the small Jedi Initiate clothes I had on.In a different pile, I started putting a lot of the food I smuggled away in my Inventory. A small crate of pallies, wrapped jerky, and candied bugs that Anakin likes to eat.To be funny, I took a step back, had my long sleeve over my right hand, and started shaking it. Gems, other precious metals, and pretty rocks flowed from my hand like a faucet. Last to come out was the Republic Credits I had stashed away. My money pile was much smaller since I saved Mama Shmi last year. The other things were loot I received last year with Anakin doing dungeons.A small crown was the last to pop out, which I plucked from my little hoard and put on my head before sitting down.Sitting on the ground, I unwrapped the pile of Bantha Jerky that I had left from Tatooine and took a bite from a large piece, suddenly feeling very hungry.I smiled unashamedly at everyone with a cheeky smile as they gaped at everything.It was blissfully silent as I chewed on my bantha meat.

FP 15/210
Sweet, food helps me regain Force Points. But I wonder what gives me HP?Looking at the stunned faces of Mace Windu and Yoda made me smile. I picked up another pair of jerky and held it out to them.“Jerky?”Instead of replying to me, Windu spoke to Obi-Wan, “I understand what you mean about her.” Obi-Wan nodded.I frowned at them.“Fine, no jerky for you.” I got up and ran to Master Plo, but not before taking all my money back into my Inventory.Like all fanfiction portrayals, Master Plo met me with happiness as he got to interact with children. I jumped in his lap and gave him some of my food. “You can have these later.” He nodded at me very seriously as he put the jerky in his pocket.“Initiate.” I looked up at Depa.“Will you please tell us how you’re able to sense…these dungeons and how you can carry all of that? Please.” She said please, so I gave her a bone.“I woke up with it. I didn’t question it; it helped me escape the lizard guys who kidnapped me.” I shrugged my shoulders. “When I crashed on Tatooine, it led me to Anakin, and it told me we could get stronger by doing the quests in the dungeons. It also gave me all of that!”I pointed at the items I laid on the floor. I paused.“Except for the bugs. Those are for Anakin.” I made a disgusted face. “He likes eating the candy bugs. He chews on them and makes them crunch in front of me.” I shuddered.Depa had a slight smile on her face, “And why do you have them?”“So I can bribe Anakin to stop doing stupid stuff,” I said seriously in a childish manner. I’m mimicking all the children I remember who had a serious conversation about a silly topic.“And this works?” She asked me.“He loves food. All boys love food, and you get through them through their stomachs. See.” I point at Obi-Wan, who is finishing his pallie.The three females in the Council room laughed as Obi-Wan’s ears turned red while the males grumbled at his defense. Master Plo just laughed.After everyone calmed down, Depa asked me more questions like a kindergarten teacher while I humored her.“Do you know where all the dungeons are, and are they safe?”“I don’t know where all of them are. I have to explore the Temple more, but there’s lots in the Fountain room!” I said enthusiastically, “And, of course, they’re safe. If Obi-Wan hadn’t gone with us, we could have left earlier if we got bored.”“What do you mean if Obi-Wan hadn’t gone with you?” Windu cut in.I gave it a thought, “It assigned him as a mentor for us and gave us extra protection against the enemies.” I tried to put this in non-gamer terms. “Obi-Wan is a Soresu fighter, so it made the enemies more prone to miss us, but we got extra experience with him as a mentor, but it didn’t allow us to leave the place until we finished the quest.”Obi-Wan had a thoughtful look on his face when I said that.“I bet if you went with us, it would make more enemies for us to fight. The dungeons adapt to the people going in. But I can’t go in some dungeons unless I’m stronger or have to fit a requirement like being faster or have a technique that I haven’t learned yet.” I told Windu.The Master of the Order had a thinking face on.“You say there’s more in the Temple?” I nodded my head.“What about the training rooms?” I stopped to think.“There’s one, but I think it’s mostly for practicing the lightsaber forms.” I had a bright smile on, “That’s where that Force ghost is! He likes to stand next to the entrance of that one.” I pouted then, “He doesn’t let me go in, though. He says I need to be a Padawan with a Master to go through.”A calculating look appeared on Windu’s face.“Are you the only one who can see these dungeons, or can anyone see them?” I gave a questioning look.“No, apparently, Anakin can sense where they are, but he can only do that if I’m with him. After that, he might be able to see them later. I don’t know.”“And no doubt what we say, you and Young Skywalker will still go through these dungeons with or without supervision.” The Master looked me in the eyes, and wisely I said nothing.Everyone in the chambers looked on as Windu processed his thoughts.“I will take him on.”
Huh?
“When he passes his Initiate Trials, I will take Anakin Skywalker as my Padawan Learner.”
What???!
I felt a flare of annoyance before it was smothered, and I looked around and noticed it was Qui-Gon. Unfortunately, the only people that seemed to sense that split-second emotion was Master Yoda, Obi-Wan, and, I think, Master Plo. The Kel Dor twitched a little before I felt him chuckle at the look Qui-Gon was now shooting at Mace.
Uh-oh. Did I start a Padawan war or something?

Chapter 13: Master Fight

 
A loud feminine squeal erupted.“You’re giving me a Padawan brother?!” All calm composure left Depa Billaba’s face at the idea of a new sibling from the blond himbo I know as Anakin.I felt my eyes widen as I watched her.Mace looked like he wanted to sigh. “Yes, you’re getting a Padawan sibling.”Qui-Gon interrupted, “I find that hard to achieve when I, a non-Council member, would like to put in my petition to be Anakin’s Master.”Both Jedi Masters seemed to glare at each other.
Ooh, this is good.
I turned around and looked at Plo, and did the child whisper, AKA let everyone hear me, “Are we going to see a fight? Can we get bangcorn to watch?” Despite my dislike of that word, I used it instead of popcorn. Plo didn’t reply, but I felt his laughter in the Force.Both Masters faltered as they turned around to look at me.“No, Initiate. We will not be fighting. We can discuss this maturely.” Mace said.“Yes, we can discuss how Anakin will be my Padawan. I’m sure you’ll be busy with Council and Master of the Order duties.” Qui-Gon folded his hands into his robes as he smugly looked at the slightly shorter man.This renewed the tensions between them.Before anything worse could happen, I decided to pipe in.“Why don’t you both teach him and have joint custody of Anakin? Master Windu can teach him to be stronger, and Master Jinn can teach him more philophi-, philoco-, philosophical things.” My mouth moved like I tasted something terrible as I tried to say philosophical, and my face scrunched up, annoyed that I still had problems saying words even though I took the Linguist Perk.The room stopped for a moment as they registered what I said. Half the room felt like they wanted to coo at me in the Force, and the others were contemplating what I had just said to solve the fight.Qui-Gon, ever the Maverick, said, “Of course, Mace can be the combat instructor as long as I will be Anakin’s main Master.”Mace glared at his friend, “Why don’t I be the main Master, and you can have him on weekends? You are, after all getting up there in age for humans.”“I second that motion.” Depa held her hand up, still excited to get a new brother.Windu and Jinn glared at each other again.I jumped off Master Plo’s lap and ran back to the middle of the room. “Can I be the referee? I got flags.” With a broad smile, I held up two cloths, one purple and the other green, and started flapping them.“Thumb wrestle, GO!” I waved both colored flags down, looked at the competitors, and frowned at them. “You’re supposed to thumb wrestle. Unless you want to be unoriginal and do a lightsaber fight on the salle.” I added with a roll of my eyes.My eyes caught Obi-Wan, who had a funny expression on his face. He pointed at me when he saw me and wordlessly said, “I know what you are doing. You can’t fool me!” I giggled and turned away from him.I turned back at the two Masters when I had a crazy thought, “Oh, oh! Or you could hold a mouthful of water and take turns slapping each other's cheek! The one who can’t hold their water loses. Anything, including the Force, is allowed, but no hits below the belt! And no hand cupping.” I started laughing at everyone’s expressions. I doubt I knew the Star Wars equivalent of a tortilla, so I said slapping. They’re Force Sensitive; they can take it.I heard a laugh and saw Depa almost go into hysterics. “I second the motion. Let them slap each other silly.”“…That would be a sight to see, honestly,” Obi-Wan admitted.I clap my hands, “Best two out of three! We can make it harder by doing rock, paper, scissors to see who slaps who instead of taking turns.” I grin more as I change the conditions.The Council chamber was in consensus to see the slap fight as the entire thing snowballed out of Mace Windu and Qui-Gon Jinn’s hands. I think they were mainly bored and wanted to see something new.At the expense of Mace and Qui-Gon, of course.Another loud thump echoed in the chamber. “A Jedi Master’s conduct, this is not.”Everyone turned to look at Yoda.I walked away from Mace and Qui-Gon to interrupt the old Master, “I’ll go frog hunting for you and find you juicy frogs!” A loud ‘eh hum.’ sounded, and I saw Master Yaddle, “And I’ll find some for Master Yaddle too!” She leaned back into her seat, satisfied.Master Yoda paused and thought about it.To sweeten the deal, “I’ll find you 20 each! If I find more, then you can have them.”He thumps his cane again and looks at the competing Masters, “Fight, you will. Determine the primary Master for Young Skywalker. And hunting, you will go.” He eyes me, but I only beam back at the green Master.The two squabbling Masters were flabbergasted at how they got maneuvered into a slap fight for frogs by a child.“Yay!” I clapped my hands.The others in the room were still adjusting to the knowledge that Yoda and Yaddle ate frogs. And how in the world did an Initiate find that fact out?“We can do it here.” So I walked over to the cart with glasses and a water pitcher and pushed it to the middle of the room next to the vict- I mean, contestants were.“Watch, you will not.” I looked back at the Grandmaster with wide eyes. “For Masters only, to contest Padawanships. Watch, no need for you.”“But-”He clacks his gimer stick to the floor, “Hunting, you will go. Take Knight Kenobi, you will.”Mace Windu’s eyes flashed, “And Depa, you will go as well.” His smile told retribution was at hand as he directed it to his former Padawan to the door. The female Chalactan sputtered but got up with a ‘hmph’ and started ushering my pouting self to the door. Her expression was almost mimicking the same pout.“Yes, Obi-Wan. Have fun hunting.” Qui-Gon patted the other redhead as he picked up a glass.Just before the door closed, I shouted, “Master Yaddle is going to have the extra frogs!”A sharp feeling of dismay echoed in the Force while another echoed happiness and smugness.

I crossed my arms and slammed my head into Obi-Wan’s leg, “I can’t believe we’re going to miss it.”Obi-Wan sighed, “I can’t believe you got away with your tricks Little Kenobi. And must you be so violent? You’ll give us both bruises.”I mumbled, “Yes.”Depa blew a raspberry in the air, “I can’t believe Master threw me out just for me laughing.” She sighed, “Oh well, come on, little one. I’m sure the Fountain room has your frogs.”I perked up and started walking beside her, “Do you have any funny stories about Master Windu?”“Oh, do I.” Then, Depa started regaling me about a mission she was taken to Mygeeto with Mace, and by the time we reached the fountains, she had us laughing heartily.“Well, where do you want to start?” Depa questioned me.I tried to raise an eyebrow at her, but I failed. “You’re not helping me?”“Oh no, we’re here as supervision. This is all you’re doing, little one.” She said cheekily.I groaned but looked at my compass. I pulled out of my Inventory a small net and walked with purpose to the nearest critter.I heard the two adults speaking from behind me, “You know, I’m not going to get used to that. But, at least she can hide things on missions.”I heard Obi-Wan groan, “Please don’t encourage her.”The first frog jumped in front of me, and I chased after it before catching it with the net I got from another dungeon quest.The next hour was filled with me catching frogs while Obi-Wan and Depa shouted helpful (not really) advice from the sidelines.Before long, I got all 40 frogs and five extra ones for Master Yaddle. All of them disappeared into my Inventory.Once I was done, I walked back to the others and sat my tiny ass on Obi-Wan’s foot because I can. “I’m tired!” I leaned against him as the ginger Knight sighed.“How exactly will you give the frogs to Master Yoda and Yaddle?” He questioned me, not even trying to dislodge me from my seat.“I was just going to release them into the Council Room and run.” I looked up at Obi-Wan’s unimpressed, upside-down face from the ground. I gave a big toothy smile at him.A snort came from Depa. “While a great idea that would be, I don’t think anyone else would appreciate it.”I sighed.“We’ll let’s go, then.” Obi-Wan waited for me to get up. I instead pivoted around and hugged my legs and arms around his leg.I giggled while he shook his head and started walking with me hanging on. I heard Depa chuckle as she followed us.We reached the Council doors without anyone seeing us, surprisingly. Once entering, we, Kenobi2, stopped in the middle of the room as Depa returned to her seat.Qui-Gon had a bruise forming on his left cheek, and Mace had a matching one on his. Both sported wet spots in various places on their clothes. I started snickering into Obi-Wan’s pant leg.“So, who won?” Obi-Wan looked at his former Master and then at the Master of the Order.“Primary Master, Master Windu will be. Master Jinn secondary.”Qui-Gon had a disgruntled look on him, but eventually, he let it go. Accepting that he had lost. He still got a place to teach Anakin, which was okay.Though, admittingly, not how he pictured the start of it all.“Unprecedant it was.” Ki-Adi Mundi said dryly but humorously.A sly smile appeared on Yoda’s face, “Humm, maybe solve future disagreements, this will.” The gleam in his eye told me how much laughter he had at the competition.“Back you are. Frogs you hunted, yes?” Yoda eyed me with anticipation.I smiled and got off Obi-Wan’s foot. As I was about to release the frogs, Obi-Wan’s hand landed on my head, trapping me before he said, “Give it to them properly. Don’t release them all like you were about to do.”I wasn’t going to…Maybe.  “I don’t have a box for them,” I pouted. I walked over to my pallie crate and started emptying it all. The fruit and the other foodstuff went back into my Inventory. I dragged the crate to the water cart and took the serving tray without making a mess. Making sure the tray was on the crate, I left an opening and released the frogs before quickly closing the tray over the hole. Holding the tray, I put the heavy water pitcher onto it and pushed the crate to Master Yaddle.Frogs croak as they try to escape their makeshift prison.“Thank you, Initiate Kenobi.” The diminutive green Master smiled at me while Master Yoda huffed at having to wait his turn.
Quest Complete!: Frog Hunting

“You’re welcome! Bye!” I walked briskly to the door before being yanked back by Obi-Wan.“Don’t think I forgot about your healing ability. We need to get you signed up with Healer Che for proper lessons.”“But I got classes to go to!” I whined. I didn’t want to miss Galactic History.“We already excused you from the rest of your classes. Initiate.” Mace said with a chuckle as I radiated with dismay and slight joy at no classes, but then I’m missing a history class which sucks. “Your makeup work and assignments were sent to your datapad.”Great.At the end of the day, I was assigned Healing courses in my free time when I wasn’t in my other classes.The Jedi Council in attendance were still baffled that I had to sing to heal and were determined to see the extent of it. Healer Che had flown out of her Healing Halls when she heard the extent of my gift and wanted to see me flourish in her Halls. Just wait until I get Anakin to do the same thing. But I doubt he’ll sing like me.Besides the new Healing courses, a random Knight (coughObi-Wancough) and a Master from the Council or Master Jinn will be my new chaperones when I explore the Temple. Any dungeon crawling I do with Anakin will now require those new babysitters. Other Initiates joining will be on standby until each dungeon has been appropriately vetted. However, they might postpone it all until Anakin is officially a Padawan. Which lame but okay. Understandable from a responsible adult's view.That’s fine. I can still sneak around or something.Maybe.Ugh. When you try to have a little chaos in your life, someone’s got to ruin it.Here’s life to being an actual supervised five-year-old magical girl.The only good thing is I managed to steal back some of the wine cubes from Obi-Wan, the traitor.I later learned that somebody on the Council (Or Obi-Wan) gossiped about the fight. No one outside of 15 of us from that day knew what the fight was about, but it was blown out of proportion after each retelling. It wouldn't surprise me if it was Yoda, the green troll, that spilled the beans. He seems like someone to incite chaos for fun.

Chapter 14: Visits From The Abyss
 A small lock of hair rested in my mouth as I typed my answers on the terminal before me. Some of the Initiates in my age group were taking the same test as me. Ahsoka and Baily had decided they didn’t want to do the first Trial and might take the next one. At the same time, Anakin and his group were off to Illum to get their first Kyber crystal.Anakin had just turned 11 and passed his Initiate Trials to his everlasting glee. With this, he was all set to be a new Padawan after he returned with his crystal. Gossip that I totally didn’t hear from the Masters. (Totally different reason, I hacked into the security feeds using Technopathy with Sumomo to get a copy of the Slap Fight) According to rumors, Master Windu and Master Qui-Gon will be waiting for Anakin when he returns from Illum in a week. The other Initiates would return to the dorm for a short rest before competing in the Apprentice Tournament to showcase their skills to available Masters.As for me, I was taking my first test of the Initiate Trials on Beginning Force Theory. It’s not hard, just reciting the Jedi Code and the structure of the Jedi Order. Knights Corps and the Services Corps duties, as well as a couple of questions and short answers about the Force.There were two other trials I would have to pass. The second Trial is about self-discipline, basically meditation or a lightsaber demonstration with the blackout helmets.For the final Trial, we would have to show our connection to the Force and that we could meet the standards of a Jedi. We were to demonstrate everything we were taught about the Force and run a miniature obstacle course. It wasn’t long, less than a minute to complete. I think the most messed up thing was that we had to do it blindfolded while reciting the Jedi Code.An Initiate can choose when they take their trials, but they have an age limit where they must take the trials or go to the Service Corps. During the Clone Wars, the Jedi must have done away with the age limit since Ahsoka was 14 (I think?) when she was given to Anakin.I typed my last answer in my terminal and submitted the test. A ding sounded in my ears from the Gamer as the Knight proctoring the test looked at me and nodded his head. A number appeared on the terminal for me to read before he gestured me to the adjacent room where multiple Masters were there to review the test answers from the Initiates. I was assigned to station two, where three Masters would look over my answers, and they were to give me my pass or fail.This reminded me way too much of taking my promotion test. But at least I didn’t almost lose my CAC (Common Access Card) right before the second half of the test was about to start. They know who I am. I’m like one of three redheads in the Order. Of course, there might be more, but whatever. Too much anxiety for a simple test.Walking out the door, I noticed the next room had small offices for privacy. So I went to the second door and knocked firmly three times. I waited for a few minutes before I heard the ‘come in’ and entered the room.None of the three other sentients were Masters that I was familiar with. They gestured for me to stand before them, which I did, and gave them a bow.“Initiate Kenobi; you did well on your First Trial.” The first Master said with a smile. He was a Mirialan.“Yes, your answers are well thought out. That would help you with your mission reports in the future.” The female human Master in the middle said.“We hope to see you again after your Second Trial, young one. Congratulations.” A…tree person said?That seemed like a dismissal to me. So I bowed towards them again and went to leave but was stopped by the male Master.“Ah, don’t forget your treat. For a job well done.” He pulled out a bowl of giant lollipops that made me grin at him.“Thank you!” I said after I took a berry flavor one and skipped out the door.I heard light laughter as the two females teased the Mirialan of spoiling the Initiates that came through their door. Jokes that he should have been a Creche Master instead of an Archivist.When I walked out of the room to the hallway, I was immediately tackled by a white and blue blur. Crashing to the floor, I told Ahsoka, “Am I a bad influence on you that you have to glomp me every time we see each other? We share rooms, you know.”“How was it? Was it hard? Is that a lollipop?!” The six-year-old almost screeched out the last question, but a blue hand covered her mouth.“Shhhh, Ahsoka. They’re taking a test.” Baily then proceeded to drag us down the hall. Yes, I do mean dragged as he pulled us by our tunics down the hall, using the Force to make him stronger as we giggled.A passing Knight paused at the hallway intersection to watch us being silly. He shook his head and went in the opposite direction.“Alright, alright! Stop. I don’t want to get any dirtier, Bee!” So he dropped us, and I pushed Ahsoka off of me. I looked at the time and noticed it was nearly lunch. So I stood up and helped Ahsoka stand.“It’s midmeal time. Let’s get food. Race ya!” I started running down the hall with the other two after me. We were neck and neck to the closes cafeteria when we rounded a corner and saw something terrible. I Paused.It was Master Windu and his stare of doom. He looked like he was definitely getting annoyed, and he had…ugh, he had Palpatine with him and some Senate minions. It looked like that horn guy and the bald chick with secretary minions.
What to do, what to do. Hey Force, what do I do?
I felt a nudge as my thoughts got directed to something I remembered.I Unpaused.To avoid any questions about me running and avoiding any future talks with the Bitch Lord, I made an abrupt stop after looking at Palpatine, and I screamed.I screamed a horrified scream which caused Ahsoka and Baily to stop and scream too. A true Hollywood scream of terror. The Golden Trio from Harry Potter would be amazed at our scream. The non-Force Sensitive Senate minions in the group across from us felt the emotions that Ahsoka and Baily naturally released, and they screamed too.I tugged on my friends' hand, and we Force Speed away, screaming as all manner of Jedi Knights and Masters watched us run while they scratched their heads in confusion. The Initiates in the halls that happened to be on their way to lunch looked back also before screaming their heads in terror and running after us.I don’t know what they were screaming about nor why they were copying us, but this makes this even funnier.Running down various corridors, we reached the cafeteria, all the while screaming. Finally, when we reached the door, I stopped and looked back.“Why did you guys scream with us?” I asked the other Initiates who followed us.Some shrugged, and others grinned before saying the Force told them to copy us. The rest of the kids said that they were copying their friends. I did a mental count, totaling twenty Initiates plus me running away from Palpatine. Good count.I heard a few stragglers screaming down the hall, but at a higher pitch than I was used to. The screaming came closer before coming to a stop. Oh, spoke too soon. The new arrivals were a younger creche clan of toddlers that got away from their caretaker. Magic babies were apparently faster than their non-Force Sensitive counterparts. It seems they came from the same area that Master Windu and Palpatine were in.“Un..’ do good?” A little toddler waddled up to me and hugged me as he asked this question.I hugged him and said, “Yes, you did great. Did you listen to the Force?”Little heads bobbed up and down to me.“That’s awesome. Let’s get food!” Children cheered around me, and we entered the room.People of all ages stared at the door we entered with confusion, wondering what all the screaming was about. They slowly returned to their conversations and meals when they saw that none of us were scared. Occasionally we had a Master or Knight check up with us to ensure nothing was wrong. They were most likely worried about the screaming outside the cafeteria doors. Finally, a Creche Master slammed open the doors and slumped with relief as they saw their lost toddlers sitting and eating calmly at the table in the center of the room. Some of the worried Knights had maneuvered all of us Initiates to the center in concern because of the screaming.I bit my lip to stop my laughter and looked down to continue eating.Time passed before the doors slammed open again, and Master Windu stalked into the room. He made a beeline to the open seat before me and sat at my table. With a mouth full of food, I pushed the plate with a burger and juice cup with a straw I had saved just for him across the table.The entire hall was silent as they watched Master Windu. A couple of the Initiate toddlers looked in awe at him sitting at our table (one was even drooling), while Ahsoka and Baily looked petrified to see him.He gave me a stern look, took hold of his burger, and took a bite. He chewed a bit, swallowed, and took another bite before setting it down. After swallowing the burger bite, he said, “Mmmhmm, this is a tasty burger.” Then, he picked up his drink and took a long sip staring me in the eyes as he drained his muja juice.Is he trying to intimidate me? This scene looks familiar.Master Windu set down the cup and started.“You mind telling me why you started a public panic and caused Initiates in the vicinity to scream and run away when they saw the Supreme Chancellor? It went over for an hour before the Senate Party left the Temple.” Waves of interest from the Knights and Masters trickled in as they watched on.I swallowed my food. “Whoa, it went on for an hour?” I said, amazed.He glared at me.“I did it because he looked creepy, and it looked like you need help. So I just did what the Force told me to. Did he come here for a specific reason?” I asked curiously.I heard a scattering of voices from the Initiates around me pipe up in various statements consistent with, “Yeah, the Force told us too.”Windu’s vein looked like it wanted to throb before continuing.“He came here to see you and Initiate Skywalker.”I made a face. “Why would an old politician want to see two underage children?” I asked bluntly. “That’s creepy. I don’t want to see him.” I took another bite of my burger, chewing happily as others (Mostly older Knights and Masters) were scandalized at my disrespect to the Master of the Order.Windu raised an eyebrow before taking another satisfied bite from his burger. “He wanted to give his thanks for helping Queen Amidala during the Naboo Crisis and came personally to say it. The Chancellor said he wanted to see what kind of Jedi you both would become.” From the Master’s expression, it looked like he didn’t like it either.I swallowed. “Master Windu, you know how weird that sounds, right? And why didn’t he come two years ago? It would have been more appropriate to send a letter than to ask to see two children he doesn’t know. Also, why didn’t he thank us then when we were in his office during the crisis? All of this sounds like super creepy pedophile behavior to me. Or he wants a Jedi minion.” I shrugged. More Knights and Masters lightly gasp as they gossip around us, listening in.The little Initiate toddlers were looking at us with wide mouths opened as their eyes darted from me to Windu.“In plus, I don’t want to be near a politician who uses clever words to make his Queen call a vote of no confidence in the Chancellor Valorum. Ani and I were in the other room when he was talking to the Queen, and he kept pushing her to call that vote saying the Republic was corrupt and they should have a new Chancellor.” I took a long sip of my juice, not seeing Windu’s eyes widen at the information. “I wouldn’t be surprised that he had people vote him in as Chancellor by stacking the count with sympathetic votes, blackmail, and other things.”I think I was a bit on the nose about the outsider information I was giving Master Windu, but why wouldn’t I want to see what chaos that brings? I took another long sip and came to the bottom. I frowned sadly at the cup.Mace Windu frowned at me. “So what you’re saying is that you’re going to run screaming in the other direction if you see Palpatine,” he says flatly.I beamed at him, “Yes!”The Master looked around at the other Initiates, and the ones that told me the Force told them to also nodded their heads. Some shyly murmured yes while others like-minded to me said, ‘Aye, sir!’ with grins.“If I were to ask Initiate Skywalker…” he says questioningly to me.“Anakin would most likely punch him in the gut before screaming and running away. He doesn’t like creepy men, either.” I said flippantly.I had taught him to scream and do anything he could to protect himself from sexual predators and opportunists. Shmi didn’t see the harm in it as long as he didn’t do it in front of Watto or the Hutt cartel.Master Windu closed his eyes and took a deep breath before exhaling. He got up from his seat and took his burger, gesturing to one of the cleaning bots in the cafeteria.He looked back at me and all of the other Initiates.“Keep the screaming to a minimum. I don’t want the Temple in an uproar whenever you do the same thing. Emergencies only.” He looked sternly at us all.“But we saved you from like a whole day of boring Senate stuff!” I said with my eyes wide at him with my Baby-doll eyes in effect. I no longer need to have crying eyes to affect people. Still can’t affect Jedi Masters, though.He opened his mouth and was silent for a couple of seconds. He couldn’t contradict that statement.“Emergencies only.” He said, still strict as he turned to leave.“You’re welcome, Master Windu!” I yelled behind his back, and other Initiates said the same thing to him. He grunted and left the room.Gossip talk was full-blown in effect after the door closed behind him. I laughed a little and finished my burger while Ahsoka and Baily stared at me.“Wizard,” Baily said.I looked at my datapad and noticed the time. “Uh-oh, I got Healing to go to. Don’t want Healer Che mad at me for being late.” I waved bye to everyone and hurried on to my next lesson.

I Paused and laughed my ass off. Is this what Master Qui-Gon has? Does Obi-Wan have it?Wiping my tears, I composed myself and Unpaused so I could continue walking to the Healing Hall, still snickering as I thought about what Qui-Gon or Obi-Wan could have done to get their Maverick Achievements.Eventually, I made my way to the Halls and said hi to the same Padawan and Knight duo that helped take out Anakin’s chip.I blinked and suddenly saw the Healer glow with a quest marker above her head.“Healer Che?” I asked and activated the quest marker.“Oh, Initiate, just who I wanted to see. I got the results I was looking for.” I tilted my head in question.“I sent an inquiry to Stewjon to ask if they have any further information about yourself, and I received a reply.” She stacked a couple of flimsy (ugh, paper!) and a small datapad. “I don’t know if you recall, but we don’t have many Stewjoni Jedi. Only you and Knight Kenobi. This datapad is a list of health records and a primer about your biology for you to browse here and in your off time.”She handed me the datapad. “This is your copy. Be sure to read up on it. We’ll be testing your knowledge in the coming weeks. Now, this,” she gestured to the papers in her hand, “is all the information I could get about your family history. The Stewjoni Government went above and beyond to get what they could when I told them you didn’t remember anything prior to your arrival on Tatooine. The reason why it took so long was that they had to start an investigation on your disappearance and….” She looked at the first page, “And your mother too.” Healer Che said softly as I stared at the papers in her hand.“Okay.” I didn’t say much more as she herded me to a seat in her office.I blinked as I saw Master Ali-Alann in one of the seats in the office. He smiles and gestures to me to the other one. I took the seat and looked at my Healing Mentor.“Now Xai-Wan, you don’t have to look at this today. We can shelve it and leave it for another day or not at all. Do you want to know?” She looked at me, and I glanced at my Creche Master, who smiled encouragingly.
Major Quest: Who’s Your Daddy? (Or Mommy?)

[ ] Accept [ ] Decline
Yes, I wanna fucking know!!
[X] Accept
The Healer looked at the papers and started listing facts about my life that I didn’t know.“Xai-Wan Kenobi was born in the Year 7940 CRC (Coruscant Reckoning Calendar AKA 37 BBY) to Rowan of Clan Kerr. There was no father listed. Your mother was a single mother, and whenever officials or friends asked about your father, she would reply that he was.…” Che scrunched her face as she read the passage, “a whirlwind winter romance. I don’t expect him to return, but if he did, I wouldn’t lie to him about his baby.”I gave her a blank look. Was my mom a hippie?“Your mother was, it seemed, a local botanist and owned her own business called Rowan’s Botanicals, a small subsidiary to Clan Kerr’s main branch Kerr’s Apothecary. Said business has been in the care of a cousin in Clan Kerr since her death and your disappearance. Around two years ago, she asked her family to take care of her business so that she could take you on a trip to Coruscant.”Here Healer Che gave me a sympathetic expression, “They found her body in the alley of the starport with contusions and blaster burns and no sign of you. Your family was relieved to hear that you made it to the Jedi, and they sent their contact information. They said they would welcome you home if you ever decided to leave the Jedi Order.”The Twi’lek flipped through pages to read the rest of the information before handing it to Master Ali-Alann. “The other information is hospital records and whatever information they had on your father from your mother's snippets.”My Creche Master handed me my papers, and I looked through them. Healer Che indeed said a summarized report of what I had in my hands, and I flipped to the other pages about my blood type.I got a confused look on my face, “What’s this?”It was an acronym I wasn’t familiar with attached to my blood type and list of family history. So I walked up to her desk and pointed at the paper, and she read it.“Ah, this is a protein carrier type that the hospitals noticed when you were born. They were able to isolate the specific protein and…” she took another look at it. And she had a surprised look on her face. “It seems they identified the specific regions from which your father could have originated. Your father has the same protein carrier as those in the Mandalore and Yavin systems. I already cross off the Dathomir system, as you have no recessive Zabrak genes.”Suddenly, my Gamer HUD started playing the Mandalorian theme song without my input. I had to squash my inner fangirl lest I show it on my face.Aww, the Force likes me. It gave me a fucking clue! Daddy’s a fucking Mandalorian.“….If I’m a Mandalorian, can I wear armor?” I said with big eyes.Both older Jedi looked at me in amusement. “I’m sorry, darling. Jedi hadn’t worn armor since the New Sith Wars. You have to swear their Creed to earn their armor.” My Crech Master said with a bit of humor, knowing what my following response would be.I groaned and flopped across Master Ali’s lap in disappointment. I think I now know where Obi-Wan gets the ‘Darling’ endearments from.At least I got one clue. So now the question is, is my father a nobody or somebody in the Galaxy Far, Far Away?


Just a face claim for who I think suits Revan. Also, the picture on the right is height comparisons at the start of the Phantom Menace for the disaster lineage. Even if Anakin will mostly be with Mace's lineage.

Chapter 15: Budding Emotions

 
Before I could weep my sorrows for not being able to wear Beskar’gam, my head popped up as I thought of something.I looked at my Creche Master, “Doesn’t the Jedi still have armor in storage or something from the Army of Light?” I begged him with pleading eyes.Master Ali chuckled at me, “That is a question you have to ask Madam Nu, little one. It’s possible, though.”I pouted, got off his lap, and sat in the other chair. Then, I grudgingly started skimming my health records again to see if there was anything else I needed to know.One thing caught my eye as I read.“Master Che, Stewjoni are near-human?” I said with a confused look on my face. I wonder what fanfiction writers would do to kill for this information?“Yes, from what I understand, Stewjoni is slightly different from the standard humans in the galaxy. That datapad I gave you will cover all that information, which I will be learning with you. I expect you to read through the first three chapters on the introduction to Stewjoni biology and the basic body functions.” The healer said without looking away from her computer as she typed something quick and turned back to look at me.I turned on the pad and opened the first file, and a digital book was displayed to me.
Technopathy: Download File?

[ ] Yes [ ] No
I barely twitched.
[X] No
I would rather read this all first before doing anything weird with my Technopath powers. I don’t know if my tiny brain can take it. I mused that a children’s book would serve better as an experiment.The title of the chapter was large against my screen. Stewjoni Biology: Chapter 1.Though, I didn’t start reading it. Instead, I went to the index to see if there was a chapter on differences in biology. Huh, it’s in the later chapters.Quickly scanning the script, my eyes widened at the cautionary words.“Master Che, what does this mean?” I got up again and showed her my datapad.The blue Twi’lek hummed with a frown as she read the words. “That… explains some things.”Both Master Ali-Alann and I looked confused.“Stewjoni are natural empaths like the Kiffar, who have a one in a hundred population ratio of having psychometry. Stewjoni empaths can feel the emotions of others, and the stronger empaths can project and influence those around them. Unfortunately, young children cannot filter out other beings’ emotions or keep their emotions from influencing their peers. It says here that adult Stewjoni can usually mitigate the issues to help prevent such occurrences due to their biological nature. Usually, the parents take on that role, but a dìon can shield and protect a child from this. (My Linguist perk automatically translated dìon to protector or defender. Stewjon is Space Scottland!).”Master Che looked dismayed the further she read. I glanced at Master Ali (Haha, my stupid brain keeps on thinking of Aladdin’s Prince name. I dubbed thee Prince Ali.) and saw that he, too, was upset at the information being read to me.The healer continued before my inner ADHD took over my brain. “Infancy to pre-adolescent years is when young Stewjoni are more likely to develop their empath abilities or not develop them at all. During this time, the child can have emotional outbursts or appear more aggressive. These outward signs are caused by the child’s natural ability to sense other beings’ emotions but unable to filter them out from their own. This is where a dìon or parental guidance is crucial to development.”This time she seems to be talking directly to Master Ali. “A young Stewjoni who develops their abilities without the guidance from an older Stewjoni can be a 1 in 10 chance of succeeding. Otherwise, their empath abilities can either wither and decay or go out of control as they enter adulthood.”Silence reigns in the office as I stare back at the two Jedi.“…Is sensing emotions not a Jedi power?” I asked hesitantly. I could feel their emotions roiling as they mulled over the information.Master Ali reached over and pulled me to his lap. “Of course, we can sense emotions, darling. It’s just that what the Stewjoni do is a bit different than what a regular force-sensitive does. You have to know that there are only two Stewjoni in the Order,” he tapped my nose when he said two making me go cross-eyed, “and it has been centuries since a force-sensitive Stewjoni joined the Jedi Order. So it was a shock to have found Obi-Wan at the Temple doorsteps as a babe with only his name and essential health information.” The Creche Master started brushing my hair as he thought.“The Stewjoni are a private people. So it’s surprising that they even gave us this information. We were denied when we inquired their government for the standard information package for Obi-Wan.” Master Che said unhappily as she continued to read. Her frown was becoming more pronounced the further she read.I sat and thought over what they told me. Am I an empath?“Is Obi-Wan and me empaths then? They said we have a chance not to have it.”The Twi’lek put down my new pad to look at me. “You have a very high likelihood of having empath abilities. It wouldn’t surprise me if you have already developed some ability if I heard of your adventures this morning correctly.” She looked at me as I smiled cheekily at her. I felt her amusement even though her facial expression was flat.“As for Obi-Wan, he showed signs of this before he was apprenticed to Master Jinn. I do not know if he further developed his ability or it faded.” She frowned, and I could feel her self-criticized herself for her medical blunder.I felt the same feeling from the man behind me as well as shame. I patted Master Ali’s hand, and he squeezed my hand in thanks.“One thing that concerns me,” Master Che said as she steepled her hands on her desk, “is that Stewjoni can die from touch starvation if they don’t take the proper steps in their care.”Confusion and disbelief were written on my face. Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot. Seriously?“It appears that you and Obi-Wan are from a very tight-knit social structure society. Evolution and the development of Stewjoni’s empath population caused a change in their biology. Physical contact is essential to living healthily; otherwise, it can cause early death in the Stewjoni.” Master Che said seriously.My brain froze as I thought about that statement.“What…about if I was an adult but got lost and alone for twenty years. How long do Stewjoni live?” I asked her as my mind was a flurry of activity.She frowned at me, “From what it says, a standard Stewjoni can live to over 120 years, and naturally, a force-sensitive Stewjoni would most likely live around 200.” Che looked at the datapad and browsed it a bit, “An isolation of 20 years can negatively affect the patient and cause premature aging, depression, loss grip of reality, and a host of other ailments before death. Daily social contact can prevent this, such as hugs, hand-holding, and other positive touches. Xai-Wan, I expect you to get a hug from someone daily. I don’t want to hear that you foolishly isolated yourself from contact.” She glared at me when I gave her wide eyes. She likely thought my question was asking for permission to try it.But no, what I was asking was for Obi-Wan. He spent 19 years in the wastelands of Tatooine with barely any contact except for a few animals. The Lars family most likely had not allowed physical contact with Luke, especially from what I remembered from the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.Oh, now I’m sad. Shit.My lips began to wobble, and I started getting teary-eyed as I looked at the Masters, who looked alarmed at my change. “Obi-Wan needs a hug!” I started wailing as I remembered more instances that showed Obi-Wan’s health decline. Master Ali-Alann panicked but calmed himself while hugging me and rubbing my back to soothe me.“Obi-Wan is healthy, darling. It’s okay. He’s fine.” I shook my head as I thought more about the movies and series. “But he won’t be! He needs the best hugs and cuddles!” I cried into Ali-Alann’s shoulder, hiccupping. On the inside, I was mortified that I was crying again. Why???!!

Vaguely, I was somewhat interested in the experience points, but that didn’t help me stop crying.I heard Healer Che’s strained voice, “Well, that answers that question.” I couldn’t see what she looked like, but Master Ali nodded in agreement while still comforting me.“Remember what Master Yoda said? ‘Always in motion is the future.’ I don’t know what you’re thinking, but Obi-Wan is okay. We’ll make sure he is. And I know just the person who can be his daily hugger. So what do you say, hmm?”I sniffled as I tried to calm down. I tried to breathe evenly, but every breath came out with a shudder. Then, I felt Master Ali reach out, using the Force to help me release my emotions. It was challenging, but I gave my despair to the Force, who gladly received it. In return, I felt the Force's caress as calm filled me, steadying my breathing.“Do I really get to hug him every day?” I mumbled into my caretaker’s robe.He chuckled, “Well, maybe not every day. He still has to complete his missions, which take him away from the Temple. If I recall, he and another Knight are away on a mission.”Master Ali pushed me away from him to brush my tears away. “Now, none of that. Today should be a happy day. I was told you passed your First Trial. Congratulations, darling.”As he was stroking my back, Ali-Alann looked at Healer Che. “Is there any other information we need to know, Master?”The healer, now happier that I wasn’t crying, looked back at the datapad and skimmed it for a few minutes. She frowned, “Nothing urgent, but we may need to get Xai-Wan a dìon until her apprenticeship.”“Do you think..?” Ali-Alann started.“It depends. We don’t know what duties a dìon has nor if he still has the ability.”I yawned as their words got murkier and harder to understand as I leaned more to the warmth holding me. The unexpected crying fit took a lot out of me. Most likely from what I now know as budding empathy powers.I may have dozed off as both Masters talked above me when I heard a ding from my Gamer’s HUD. Blinking blearily, I opened my map and saw a new indicator had popped up in the same hanger that Anakin and I had arrived in from the 500 Republica.On the hanger were green dots from the engineers and technicians that the Order employs and some Explorer Corps Jedi. Even though they're real people, I like to think of them as NPCs. It gets me through the day of monotony (coughAstronavigationcough).Two blue dots were on the hanger, but only one was labeled to me.Obi-Wan Kenobi was the one that was labeled.I sat ramrod from my seat in Master Ali’s lap with a cheerful cry, “Obi-Wan!”I was held down as I was about to wiggle out of my seat, “Where do you think you’re going, little one?”“Obi-Wan’s here!” I pointed in the direction of where I knew the hanger was.Both Masters looked confused when I started tilting my head as I watched the map on my Gamer’s HUD.“I think Obi-Wan is going to the Council,” I paused as the two blue dots started to make their way to the elevators that led to the central Council tower, “Yup, he’s going to the elevator right now.”Unnoticed to me, both Masters agreed about what their next destination was.Which led to me going back to the Council Chambers again.To be in front of Master Windu’s glare of doom for the second time today.
Do I have another juice cup?
With a quick message to the Council, both Masters powerwalked to the Central Spire, and I got a free ride from my Crechemaster. I will forever milk being tiny enough to carry. I don’t care; I love it.On the way there, I waved at anyone who took a second to stare at us walking by. Some were confused and stood there while others waved back. I got a small chuckle out of my antics.Before long, we were outside the doors to the chambers, and the Padawan managing the secretary position was staring at me. It was a different one than the last time I was here.We made eye contact with each other and kept it. We were still staring at each other as Master Ali moved to take a seat, and I moved myself to keep complete eye contact with the Padawan.Just as our eyes were straining, the door to the chambers opened, and the Padawan blinked, and I smirked victoriously at them.They looked annoyed at the loss, but I tossed them my lollipop from my exam, which seemed to cheer them up.
+10 Karma points: Thanks for making that Padawan’s day
Yay, now I got 70 Karma points. Kind of slow for two years, but oh well. I waved bye to them just as a female blonde Knight walked out of the chamber and returned to the elevators.
Huh, she looked really familiar, but I didn’t see her face.
I tried to get another glimpse at her, but she disappeared from view as Master Che, Master Ali, and I stepped into the room.I felt an audible sigh in the Force that sounded much like Master Windu, and I turned back to the front of the chamber. Master Windu, of course, looked like a stone-cold bastard, but I felt the wariness from him as he looked at the Masters I came in with and me. Then, for extra measure, he gave one to Obi-Wan, who I think felt offended.“Initiate Kenobi; I just talked to you earlier. What have you done now?” Master Windu’s voice was like music to my uncaring ears.I didn’t reply to him. Instead, I wiggled from my Crechemaster, who lowered me to the ground, and I was off like a rocket crashing into Obi-Wan, who looked startled.“Hugs!!” I grinned at the older redhead. “You need lots of hugs. It’s your medicine; take it!” I squeezed his waist, which I barely reached, as I felt a few Masters laugh in amusement.“Oof. Little Kenobi, what are you doing?” I felt bits of embarrassment from him, but I didn’t care. He NEEDS it.I gave him a mulish looked and squeezed him harder. Hugzzz.I felt him sigh, and he reached down to pick me up. I let him as he held me in his arms and let me hug his neck. Yazz, get with the program, Space Jesus.“What is this Space Jesus you keep on calling me?” I froze in my hug as Obi-Wan whispered to me.“Nuthin’,” I muffled myself against his robes as I started flipping out and actively thinking in Earth languages. But mostly, I was cussing out in Lao about him hearing me.I flinched when I was poked in the side, and I heard a faint. I don’t know what you said, but Language.I blew a raspberry into his shoulder.“-and that is why we came here.” I lifted my head when Master Che finished her report.Whoa, did I just miss an entire conversation about myself? Shit, what happened.“Humm, many centuries it has been since the last Stewjoni Jedi. Long before my Knighting, old Master Kenobi died of old age.”Everyone took a moment to do math mentally. That has to be more than a thousand years ago!“Why were there no records about him? I had to start from scratch with Knight Kenobi.” Master Che almost sounded indignant.Obi-Wan was silent as he listened in. He must have been listening more closely than I was.Master Yoda shook his head.“Sacked, the Temple was. Lost, records were, and stolen, artifacts were when Mandalorians came. The fall of the Old Republic, was it.”The healer seems to sigh, “I see. Then we have no choice but to ask the Stewjoni more about dìon duties. We can’t have two of our own at risk by their biology.”“Yes, seem so, it would. Go to Stewjon, they will.”And that’s how I got sent on a mission way before I became a Padawan with Obi-Wan Kenobi and a big blonde Knight that I can only see the back of his head from my seat in the back of the small starcraft on our way to Stewjon.What is with this place and blondes?I wiggled in my seat. Unfortunately, the seat belts locked me in the giant chair, and I couldn’t move. At least I wasn’t in a stupid booster seat. I pouted at Obi-Wan when he looked back at me. He grinned, and I whined at him.“Strap in, kiddos. We’re in for a long haul down Corellian Run and then the Corellian Trade Spire.”I stopped my wiggling as I heard a familiar New England accent.
Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot.
I started leaning to the side to glimpse the big blonde behemoth in the pilot’s seat.“Thank you, Knight Feemor. We appreciate your help in taking us to Stewjon.” Obi-Wan said as he helped with the calculations.“Nah, none of that formal stuff, kid. We’re Padawan brothers, especially once Qui-Gon got off his ass to introduce us.”My eyes went wide. This is Feemor!!The blonde turned around and saw me trying to lean out of my (Spaceship!) seat belt.“Hey there, bud, I know you want to run around, but we’ll let you do that when we’re in hyperspace. Just wait until you get the view.”Chris Evans's bearded face smiled at me before he guided our spaceship out of the hangar.
SflkfdslkjafslKJ; HOLY FUCK, IT’S CHRIS EVANS!!! HE’S FEEMOR!
Then I had another thought pop into my mind.
Emo Ani killed Captain America and Buzz Lightyear! That bastard!"

It's different this time around.,2023-03-11,"Work Text:
There was a time, a long time ago, where he’d been in this exact position. Bo-Katan had returned with the Night Owls from a mission to take out an Imperial base that had ended with them returning her to her brother with a concussion. He’d had to remove her headband. It was a ridiculous thing to remember despite the fact she never took it off, but Kix remembered taking off her headband and admiring how her hair framed her face differently without it on. She was softer. Younger. He never forgot that. It had initially been his suggestion to go flying. Bo-Katan had spent far too much time inside of the castle as of late, claiming she had nothing better to do then to sit in her solitude and contemplate her failures. Kix knew she blamed herself for the loss of their allies they’d brought together in hopes of reclaiming Mandalore. Bo-Katan’s helmet has absorbed the impact from the rocks at the base of the cliff. She was lucky her head wasn’t more seriously injured, but it would take considerable effort to get her helmet back into its previous shape.   “You’re lucky this wasn’t worse,” Kix chides gently. Bo-Katan remains silent, green eyes fixed on the floor of the throne room as Kix rifles through the medical kit on the arm rest of the throne. “Thankfully this is just a superficial head wound.”   “Stop acting like I’m so accident prone,” She snaps. “I haven’t been injured like this since the month we met.”   “You actually remember that?”Bo-Katan doesn’t speak again for a long moment. She isn’t particularly proud of her earliest moments with Kix. She’d been cruel to him, time and time again, and he’d just kept coming back. So damned persistent and so convinced that she was worthy of a redemption she wasn’t even actively seeking. He was so much better than she’d ever be.   “I do. I remember all of it,” It’s hard to avoid leaning into the warmth of his hand at her chin, steadily holding her head there as Kix removes her headband and brushes hair away from the wound site on the crown of her head. “And I remember the after.” Kix smiles fondly as he dabs at the dried blood with a damp cloth. “I stayed the night in your room,” He murmurs. “You were very hesitant to fall asleep without someone to watch your back.”   “And you did.”  “And I did.” The tension slowly begins to seep from her shoulders as Bo succumbs and seeks out the warmth of his hand at her jaw. It had taken years for her to be comfortable with him even being in her proximity - Mandalorians weren’t tactile, they were used to tackling lifes difficulties alone and without support - so to watch her willingly take a comfort she was so long denied is a quiet relief.   “My head hurts, Kix’ika,” Bo whispers. Kix’s fingers pause over the bacta patch he’s only just begun applying to the wound site at the crown of her head, onyx eyes flickering downward to seek out what lingers just beneath the surface. A pain Bo-Katan so rarely lets see the light of day. “Everywhere. And my vision is swimming.” It’s a good thing she’s not Force sensitive, because Bo-Katan would be able to immediately sense the spike of fear that sends a shiver down his spine at the confession. This is not a side of her anyone else gets to see. This is Bo-Katan, vulnerable and angry and raw as she comes apart at the seams in the wake of so much loss. What she seeks is something she’s never been truly able to obtain: A home for her aching heart and a medic capable of stitching together long opened wounds. Wounds in need of care. It was fortunate that so many of the people who came before Kix would tell stories of which they thrived after being in his care.   “You’re okay,” He said softly. “I’m right here. I’m going to take care of you.” The only thing that gives her focus and keeps Bo awake as he works is the gentle, deep timbre of his voice as Kix sings to her in Mando’a. It’s the lyrical version to Vode A that she’d taught him on The Reclaimer. A song that, ironically enough, has been the only thing to ground her in her most vulnerable moments. 
Like right now. 
  “I think you’re the best person I ever met.” The words are spilling out before she can stop them, and Kix lets her talk as he fixes the bacta patch in place and carefully places her signature headband back into its spot. “And you’re far too good to me, Kixy.” Bo grumbles as she jabs her thumb into his chest plate. “Far too good.”   “You deserve good after all you’ve been through,” Kix leans downward to take her arm and carefully wind it around him, using his other to wind it around her waist and hoist her to her feet. “And you deserve someone to take care of you after being alone for so long.”   “You’re not-“ She pauses to search for the right word. “Obligated! That’s it. Obligated.”   “Bo-Katan, I love you. You’re my sister. Loving you is not an obligation.” She purses her lips as he turns the corner to continue toward the hallway that holds all their bedrooms. Kix had always loved her in such an unconditional way. He’s stood by her when no one else did. He may be the only person in her life over all these decades who’s done so and hasn’t died for it.   “You love in a way that doesn’t make sense to me.” The words hang heavily as Kix enters her bedroom and slowly settles her on the edge to see if she’s conscious enough to remove her beskar. “Makes my chest hurt. I hope you realize that I love you with the same ferocity.” She frowns. ""I just don't say it enough. Why don't I say it enough...""  
Kix is careful to keep his expression blank as he motions to her with a wave of his hand. It's unlikely she'll remember most of this, but the words claw their way into his chest and settle in that vaguely brother shaped hole that's been present in his heart since he woke up from cryostasis to find out all hid brothers were dead. That brother shaped hole had slowly morphed, over time, into a messily stitched hole just big enough to fit two sisters in it. 

Two very protective, overbearing sisters who loved with everything they could give. 
 “Do you need me to remove your armor?” Bo frowns and glances downward. “Oh. I didn’t realize we were back in my bedroom.” Green eyes flicker upward and around the ceilings, to the ornate carvings in the walls and the Clan Kryze flags that hang near the door. There are little trinkets from her trips to planets in the Core and the Mid-Rim scattered in different places along the length of the room that show who it belongs to. “I don’t want to be here.” But it will never be home.Kix tips his head curiously. “Where do you want me to take you?”   “Your room.”   “You never want to stay in my room.” It’s another show of trust that she’s so openly asked him to stay with her. That’s what Bo-Katan is insinuating, after all. She wants to stay in his room because Kix is safe, her brother is safe, and nothing can harm her when she’s injured and in the care of her jetii’vod. Kix exhales softly as he drags Bo-Katan back into his arms and turns to go to the next room. He’d been deliberate in choosing his room when they arrived at the castle. Part of him wanted to go far away so as to not interrupt the few precious hours of sleep she did get when he was around. Then Bo-Katan had discovered what happened when he didn’t sleep and moved all his stuff to the room next to her own. He’d been secretly grateful for her perceptiveness.   “You’re safe,” She whispers shamefully, that same fear of admitting her weaknesses aloud creeping to the surface as it so often did when Bo-Katan had initially cared what people thought of her. That wasn’t nearly as much of a problem now when there was no one to disappoint. It had been years since she last thought Kix would leave her. Years since she even hesitated in pouring herself into his hands. “You’re here.” And in reality, that’s all Bo's asking for. Someone who will be here for her. Someone who won’t leave and will keep her safe in the moments where she simply needs to fall and be caught. Someone who will help pick her back up.   ""Course I’m here,” Kix murmurs. Kneeling down as she stumbles to the edge of the bed, Kix chuckled quietly as Bo grumbled and begrudgingly held out both legs so he could remove her boots. “Do you remember when you rescued me from Imperials? Back when they kidnapped me?” Bo nods. That’s not something she’d ever forget. “You’ve always been there for me when I needed you too, Bo. It’s not just a one sided thing.”   “It’s because I love you, di’kut. Even if it scares me.” She frowns. “Sometimes you scare me. But in a good way. You’re about as intimidating as a toddler.” Disbelieving laughter echoes in the bedroom as a neatly stacked set of beskar’gam floats across the room. “Shut up and lay down while I stack my armor.” The Kalevalan climate reminds him a lot of Kamino. It’s cold, and windy, and the rain just doesn’t stop. It’s a constant. It’s part of why he constantly wears such heavy clothes underneath his armor. The cold just doesn’t stop. Blankets upon blankets and heavy clothes are the only thing that abate the chill. It’s another long moment before he settles in on his side of the bed with enough space between them for Bo-Katan to comfortably curl up in her spot. What he gets instead is his sister, never one for being tactile, closes the space to nestle her head into the crook of his shoulder.   “It’s cold out today.” 
He's slightly taken aback by the fact her flight suit is bright yellow, a state of Clan Wren that she most definitely stole from the Wrens when they were on Krownest. So much for claiming she's not sentimental. 
  “It’s always cold out here, Bo,” Kix chides. Yawning softly, he melts deeper into the mattress and tips his head to tuck her own under his chin. “You’re lucky I run warm.”   “Do you remember whenever you used to tell me that we made you warm? Me and Ahsoka?” The more she talks, the more Kix is impressed that she’s retained all these memories of things that happened so long ago. They were both different people then. “Yes,” He murmurs. “I do.” She nuzzles the crook of his neck again and exhales softly. Her head is going to hurt in the morning. “I hope you’re warmer now then you’ve ever been,” Bo breathes. “Jate’ca, me’suum’ika.” 
Goodnight, little moon."

Chapter Text
The morning was alive with the sound of birds and the distant cars driving down the connecting major road. Chirrut sat on the balcony that overlooked the road, though his eyes were closed, and a soft smile appeared on his face. The winter storm that had raged over their city had finally abated, letting the snow shine down and melt away the snow only the day before. Chirrut felt the crispness in the air as he took a deep breathSomething new was coming to their little corner of the world, he could sense it.“What are you smiling about?”Chirrut opened his eyes and turned his head in the direction of the voice. He had heard Baze’s heavy footsteps grow louder until he was finally standing behind him.“A change is coming,” Chirrut said, putting thought to action. “There’s a slight shift in the wind, the birds are more active than normal.”Baze snorted. “You’re always saying that and so far, nothing has changed but the construction down the road. Now if they ever finished that, that would be a shift.”Chirrut’s smile grew wider at his companion’s words. “Have faith Baze, you will see.”“All I see are the chores that need to be done in our home.”“Do you need assistance?” Chirrut shifted his body to get up out of the chair but a strong hand held him in his seat.“It’s fine. Enjoy your morning.” Baze's tone was softer this time and no more words needed to be shared between them. Chirrut simply nodded and turned back towards the street while Baze set about doing the morning chairs.The world continued to grow louder, noisier, but still Chirrut held his belief, a mantra that had given him peace many times throughout his life, but especially today. He heard the distinct sound of water running in the kitchen when the first sign came that he had been right.The sound of a loud motor came from the far end of their street. He had heard the sound many times before in the years he and Baze had lived in this apartment. It was a moving truck that rumbled down the road. Not too big, but not too small, maybe for one person? A couple?He would find out soon enough when he no longer heard the sound of rubble on asphalt and the car engine began to idle. What followed was a door opening and a single set of feet hitting the road before the door closed again.“Baze—”“What do we have here?” Baze was already at his shoulder. Baze would never admit it, but Chirrut knew he was just as intrigued when a new person moved in. “A young woman with a moving truck is stopped in front of us. Of course she’s going to freeze to death with that thin jacket.” He paused for a moment and then asked, “Do you think she’s taking that apartment next to Cassian’s?”“Without a doubt,” Chirrut smiled. Baze didn’t question him, he had learned long ago not to question Chirrut when he made such bold statements.Chirrut was usually always right.Grabbing his staff, Chirrut pushed himself out of his chair and leaned out over the ledge of the balcony. No other footsteps could be heard and the sound of other cars turning on their street didn’t slow to a stop next to the woman and her moving truck.“Hello there down there,” Chirrut called out. He heard the woman’s footsteps falter, the sound of gravel under her foot as she pivoted. “Are you moving into our humble building?”“Uh, hello,” the woman said with uncertainty, reservation clear in her voice. Chirrut liked her immediately. “It appears so.”“Anyone helping you move in?” Baze didn’t lean over as far as Chirrut, but he stood shoulder to shoulder with his companion. “You aren’t going to be able to move in all by yourself.”There was a pause before the woman spoke again. “Yeah, it’s just me. I’ll be fine though.”“Bah,” Baze huffed, “Let me go get some others. We’ll be down in just a moment.” Baze didn’t wait to hear the woman try to stop him. Her assurances she would be fine only fell on Chirrut’s ears.“He’s already gone, my dear. Don’t worry, we have a couple people here right now who will make your move in go that much quicker.” Chirrut was smiling from ear to ear as he spoke. That sense in the air he was feeling was only growing stronger at the idea of the people he knew Baze would be getting to help would meet this woman. “The name is Chirrut. My companion you just spoke with is Baze.”The woman let out a breath through her nose. “That…I…it’s very nice to meet you. Name is Jyn.”“It’s very nice to meet you, Jyn.”~Jyn stared up at the man, Chirrut, with uncertainty. Right away she had noticed his eyes and the way he didn’t focus on her. But even then, there was an uncanniness about him, like he could see more than she could ever imagine. It made her curious and wanted to get to know him more, but she quickly pushed that thought aside.She was here to get away…and things were already not going as planned.Part of her wanted to just pack up and run or face whatever was happening right now. The only thing that kept her feet from moving was the fact that she had nowhere else to go and had already paid the security deposit and the first month’s rent for the apartment. She didn’t have the means to relinquish that all because of her fears.Of course she had to find the one apartment that had chatty neighbors, she grumbled, trying to remind herself to be nice. Her last apartment had been rather loud, but everyone kept to themselves. If you had an issue you shut up and dealt with it. Here though, she got the distinct impression these neighbors were not like that.A gust of wind came down the streetThe silence was starting to grow awkward, Chirrut smiling down at her as if he already knew whatever it was to know about her. But it wasn’t…scary, more like a sense of safety…Jyn turned away from him, walking towards her moving truck. But not wanting to be rude, she looked back over her shoulder and waved. The man only smiled at her.“I’m just, I’m going to get started unpacking, but thanks again.”Chirrut continued to smile. “Don’t worry, Baze will come back with help.”Jyn was about to argue with him when the door to her new apartment opened and a handful of people came out.  She stared shocked as they all walked towards her, appearing to be in a heated discussion with the older man who waved off whatever they were frustrated with.Probably with helping her.“Baze, I’d like for you to meet Jyn, our new neighbor.” He looked in the direction of the group and the one Jyn had seen early acknowledged Chirrut.“I see her!” He rolled his eyes but there was a slight upturn at the corner of his lips that made Jyn wonder if this was normal for the two men. Then Baze’s eyes were on her. “You’ve seen this place before?”Jyn eyed the men around him warily as she nodded. “Only in pictures and over video.”“Well even with the elevator, you’re going to need help if you are moving a lot of luggage.” Baze stepped forward and stared intently at the truck door. “Let’s see what you got first.”“Can I at least ask who will be helping me?” Jyn barely let her eyes move away from the other men that stood back a ways away from Baze.Baze blinked and then turned towards the others. “Right, we got Bodhi, Melshi, Brasso and Cassian.” He pointed at each man as he said their name, Jyn making a mental note to remember.The men in question each responded in their own way as they were introduced; Bodhi gave her a meek wave but a kind smile before going back to fidgeting with his hands, Melshi giving her a nod while keeping both hands stuffed in his pocket, Brasso was the only one that seemed to give her a genuine smile and nod as he kept his arms crossed, and then Cassian simply stared at her, leaning back on his hip and arms crossed like Melshi.None of them gave her any cause for concern, though from their body language she could assume at least three of the four did not want to be there. But it was the last man that kept drawing her eye, Cassian. His brown eyes never left hers, even as the other men started to discuss what was to happen. His hair was messy, but in a good way. It suited him and she felt her heart skip a beat.Jyn, she thought with a warning and looked back towards Baze and Chirrut.“Alright you four,” Chirrut began from where he still stood on the balcony. “You’re going to help our new neighbor move in.”“But we were getting ready to head out,” Melshi said, a tinge of annoyance in his voice. He motioned to Brasso and Cassian as he continued. “If we don’t leave soon then we’re going to miss out on some good snow.”“I’m pretty busy too,” Bodhi pointed out but a noise from Baze shut him up.“Bodhi, I know you’re busy tinkering away at that same contraption you’ve been working on for weeks now,” Chirrut reminded him. Jyn noticed that Bodhi only nodded, “and you three, the snow up on the mountains will be there for the next few days, unless you missed the same report I heard earlier.” Jyn had to fight back a smile as she watched everyone else interact. But then Melshi elbowed him and Cassian also joined in on the discussion.It was like watching a family bickering amongst each other, the gestures, the arguing, the few men who were calm as they spoke. Jyn couldn't help but find it rather...sweet how much they seemed to care for each other. The image of her own father flashed in her mind and Jyn’s feeling of joy evaporated. Taking a breath, she turned away from her new neighbors and lifted the rear door, revealing the spare amount of items she owned.She was climbing into the back of the truck when someone called out to her.“Hey, wait for us to help.”Jyn was surprised to hear a slight accent, one that a part of her couldn’t help but want to hear more of. But she shrugged off the thought to focus on the task at hand.“You were too busy, arguing,” Jyn pointed out, eyes trained on the boxes and furniture in front of her. “And there’s no need to feel obligated to help. I can handle this on my own just fine.”There was a sound of laughter that set her on edge, followed by the feeling of the truck bed going lower as the man climbed into the truck. The last thing she needed was to be mocked when all she wanted was to get moved in and out of the cold.Jyn turned to give who it was a piece of her mind, but stopped when she saw Cassian. He was a good head taller than her and up close he was even more handsome than she would ever let herself admit. But what surprised her the most was he wore no look of smugness, no sense that she wasn’t capable, instead he was surveying the items, eyes moving over boxes, dresser, table. She could almost see the wheels turning as he made a mental note of how to get the items out and into the apartment.In the silence, he glanced her way and gave her a soft smile. “They’re arguing, which they tend to do before they go along with whatever Chirrut says we should do. Just give it another minute. They’ll be here.”Jyn could only look up at him in surprise. “What about going skiing? Wouldn’t…I’m sure that would be more interesting than helping some stranger move furniture.”Cassian shrugged, turning to face her. “We’re neighbors now. The least I, all of us, can do is help you.” He paused for a moment and then held out his hand. “And introduce myself properly. Cassian Andor.”The world stood still for a moment, Jyn fighting to keep her mouth shut as she looked between Cassian’s outstretched hand and him. His expression was calm but welcoming, and Jyn found herself reaching out her hand to grasp his own.“Jyn Erso.”“Welcome to the neighborhood, Jyn.” Cassian smiled down at her, shaking her hand. His grip was strong, fingers rough against her own. “Now, where should we start?”They held hands for a moment longer, looking into each other’s eyes. She found herself smiling, letting herself have a little bit of hope that maybe things will be better this time around if her neighbors really are as kind as they are showing themselves to be.“Alright you two, you can get a room later.”Jyn jumped, dropping Cassian’s hand, and tearing her eyes away from his. The others were standing on the ground looking up at them and the surrounding items. Brasso was the one who spoke, giving Cassian a look as he climbed into the truck too.“Where do you want to start?”Ignoring Brasso’s comment, Jyn turned back to her stuff and started to direct the others on what she needed help with. What would have taken at least two days of moving turned into only a few hours of bringing stuff out and moving it into her new apartment. The layout of her apartment was similar to the others and made it easy for Jyn to give the general layout and with how quickly they were moving, Jyn realized they would be finished in no time.At one point Chirrut had called out to them stating the weather was going to take a turn for the worst, so they had better hurry. Jyn had looked to the skies but only saw a thin layer of clouds covering them.When she mentioned this to the others, it was Cassian that spoke up first.“You’re going to learn quickly that Chirrut is usually right in these moments.”The others nodded in agreement when she looked at them. Jyn simply shrugged and continued directing the others or helping carry items to her apartment. But as they got down to the last few boxes, the dark clouds started to roll in, leaving the rest of them moving quicker in order to be done.Jyn and Cassian were carrying the final boxes when the first flurries of snow started to fall on their street. The two of them had jumped down onto the ground and stood there staring up at the snow that was slowly falling around them. It had been years since she had been around snow and a wave of sadness washed over her at the memories that started to pop up. Memories of her mother and father, playing with them in the snow. But that was neither here nor there now.Someone brushed her shoulder, pulling her from her thoughts. Cassian was looking at her, a small smug smile on his face as he shifted the box in his arm to hold out a hand.“Told you,” he said, turning back to the snow and watching as a few flakes landed on his palm and melted immediately.“Yeah, I guess you did,” Jyn said, rolling her eyes. But even as the snow fell around them, Jyn found her eyes going back to Cassian. The snow may have melted on his hands, but flakes were sticking to his hair and eyelashes, giving him a soft glow that was only heightened by the smile on his face. He looked so happy, so alive at this moment.“What?”Jyn realized she was staring and quickly looked away. “Nothing. Come on, lets get this final stuff in so we don’t freeze to death.”Cassian nodded, but as they moved stopped and waved her on. “I’ll be up in a minute. I’ll close up the truck first.”“Oh sure, thanks.” She tossed him the keys and made her way out of the snow.Walking through the door into her new apartment, Jyn was greeted with the sound of people laughing and chatting as they stood around the haphazard environment filled with furniture and boxes. The main furniture had been set up, her bed, dresser, the living room furniture and TV. Bodhi had already got her set up and some game was playing on the screen. She couldn’t believe how at ease everyone was, let alone in her home. They were strangers, complete strangers and yet already she found herself picking up cues and mannerisms, seeing what made them friends and wanting to join in too.The others waved to her as she moved deeper into her apartment, setting down the box she carried into the bathroom adjacent to her bedroom. Noises rose from the living room, probably Cassian walking in, she thought.She walked back out and all of them were deep in conversation that she quickly realized was about their original plans to go out snowing.“What’re we going to do now then,” Melshi was asking. “Bix already texted saying she’s snowed in and wouldn’t be able to get herself out in time to get to the mountains.”“Which are already closed anyways,” Chirrut said from where he sat on her couch. “Might as well stay indoors, the weather will only get worse as the day goes on.” He motioned to the tv, where a weatherman was pointing to a screen that showed the storm that was settling in over their city.Melshi cursed while Brasso turned to everyone and asked, “Well, what do people want to do now?”“How about pizza?”The words were out of Jyn’s mouth before she even realized what she was saying. All eyes turned to her and she had to fight off the urge to hold up her hands in surrender.“Well, I still need to drop off the moving truck, so if someone were to order a pizza, I can pick it up on the way back.” She looked around at all of them, waiting for someone to tell her that was a bad idea or that they were planning to leave. But the others started to nod, and she found herself becoming excited at the idea of not having to spend her first night in the apartment…alone.“I’ll go with you,” Cassian said, taking a step towards her. When he saw she was about to argue, he continued. “Do you have a car to drive you back?”Jyn shook her head. She had one lined up but she wasn’t going to be able to pick it up till tomorrow.“Then it’s settled.” Chirrut said. “Jyn, Cassian, you go drop off the truck and we’ll let you know where to pick up the pizza. What do you want?”“You know my usual,” Cassian answered, looking at Jyn.Jyn shrugged. “I’m fine with anything really.”“Alright, you two get going and we’ll get to ordering the pizza,” Chirrut spoke up with Brasso and Baze nodding their heads in agreement.The other men started to talk about what they wanted as Jyn and Cassian made their way out of her apartment to the garage. They discussed where Jyn would be dropping off the truck and settled into a comfortable silence. Neither of them spokes but there was no awkwardness to it, no need to say something to fill the space. That didn’t stop Jyn from glancing at Cassian every so often, wondering about the man that she felt so at ease around. He held himself confidently yet it wasn’t the same as Brasso and Baze, from what she had seen. No, it was…The elevator doors opened, and Jyn stepped out. She heard the elevator doors start to close when she heard the sound of the doors stopping. Cassian held his hand out, stopping the elevator doors from closing.“I’ll be right behind you Jyn,” he said. It was a small thing and still she felt happy knowing she wasn’t alone.“I know.” She smiled at him and walked towards the exit. The hope that things would be alright in her new home only grew with each step, a warmth that almost made the chill outside bearable.Almost.









Chapter 2: Valentine's Day
    


Summary:

Jyn decides to make a sweet Valentine's day treat for her friends, which happens to be the same day as the big football game. Everyone except her is invited to Cassian's watch party, a fact she tries her best to ignore, until he shows up just before kick-off.

Chapter Text
The apartment smelled of vanilla and chocolate, a warm scent that was welcoming for Bix, but did nothing to calm Jyn’s nerves. It was Superbowl Sunday and Valentine’s Day, two days Jyn had never cared about, but her neighbors were deciding to throw a watch party at Cassian’s and she had decided to make them something as a thank you for their assistance with everything in the past month of her moving in.“I still can’t believe Cas didn’t invite you and you are still making something for his party.”The corner of Jyn’s lip curved, but she kept her eyes focused on the timer ticking down above her oven.“I swear that man,” Bix was grumbling from where she sat at Jyn’s table. “I don’t know how he does it. Always flirting up people and can’t even ask the one woman that is actually worth his time.”“Bix,” Jyn warned, finally looking to her friend. “We’ve talked about this. We are only neighbors and that’s it. I’m not looking nor need anything more.”Bix snorted. “Well, someone has to have a decent love life and the both of you are a good fit and I know Cassian finds you attractive. Just like you find him.” Bix raised her eyebrows, making Jyn roll her eyes. When Jyn didn’t say anything, Bix sighed and got up from her seat. “Fine. But you know I’m right and sometimes that boy is too dense to realize what he really wants or needs.”“And how are things with what's his face, Tim.” Jyn smiled when she saw Bix tense and then glared at her.“I dumped his ass already, when will any of you let that go?”Jyn’s smile only grew. “Eh, someday. He was an ass and never deserved you.”“No, no he didn’t, and I already learned my lesson.” Bix glanced at her phone, eyes growing wider with whatever she saw. “Shoot, I have to get going. I’m sure Cas and them will like what you make but I’m still going to yell at them for not inviting you.”“Thanks, Bix, but really it is ok.” Jyn shrugged, walking forward to turn on the light in the oven.  The tops of the cupcakes were rising nicely but that didn’t mean they would taste good. “It’s not my thing.”Bix let out a wistful sigh. “Keep telling yourself that Jyn. I’ll see you later.”Jyn waved as Bix closed the door behind her. Her apartment went quiet again and Jyn relished in the silence. Bix had become a good friend in the short month she had lived at this apartment. It surprised her at how quickly they took to each other, but with everyone in this apartment complex, that seemed to be the case. Chirrut and Baze visited her often or would invited her over for meals. The two older men were a delight to be around, even though she’d never admit it.The others she would run into leaving or coming home or going to the basement to do the laundry. They’d share simple hellos and how are you doing, or the occasional drop by to make sure she was settling in ok. Initially she had wanted nothing more than to be left alone, but the constant interaction started to grow on her, the feeling of being cared for, wanted.Something she had never imagined she would have again.Her thoughts strayed to Cassian and Bix’s words echoed in her mind. She had found him attractive from the first moment she laid eyes on him, but that could be said of any stranger passing in the street and had immediately pushed those thoughts away.But every time she saw him, in passing or when he was also over with Chirrut and Baze, she found her gaze going back to him. He was a soft man, not quick to act or be loud, but she saw the subtlety in his words, his gestures, his interactions. But the moment would pass, and they’d go about their respective livesThat didn’t mean she didn’t appreciate the times they were together. With the others of course, she reminded herself. The timer started to go off, interrupting her thoughts. She had frosting to get to.Jyn made quick work of the frosting, trying her hardest not to just eat that alone and leave enough for the cupcakes. Right as she finished and stepped back to survey her handwork, knife covered in frosting in her mouth, a knock came at the door.“One sec.” Tossing the knife in the sink, Jyn made her way to the door. To her surprise, on the other side was... “Cassian?”He gave her a soft smile. “Hey Jyn. Are you busy?”Jyn glanced back towards her kitchen. “Nope. Was actually on my way to see you in fact. What can I help you with?”“I...” Cassian coughed nervously and then glanced behind her. “Are you cooking something? That smells delicious.”“Yeah, I was actually going to stop by shortly to drop it off.” Because you didn’t invite me, Jyn thought. She hoped she kept her face neutral.At least Cassian had the nerve to look bashful. “About that...”“Hey, did you invite her yet or what?”The two of them glanced down the hall to where Melshi was leaning out of Cassian’s open door. “The game’s going to start soon!”Cassian’s face went taut and he mouthed something at Melshi while waving his hand for him to leave. The two seemed to have some internal argument for the next 10 seconds before Melshi rolled his eyes and made his way back through the door.An awkward silence fell over them, Jyn trying her hardest to hide the smile forming on her lips while Cassian kept glancing between her and some space behind her. A few more moments and Jyn figured he had suffered enough.“It’s fine really. You don’t have to invite me.”“No,” Cassian rushed out, “No that’s why I came by. I kept meaning to catch you to ask in person, but never found the right time.”I live right down the hallway. “So, you want me to come by?”“Yes of course. I won’t hear the end of it if I don’t.” Jyn strained to stop her smile from dropping, but Cassian continued. “And I want you there.”“Then I’ll be there.” She glanced down at herself. “Give me 10 minutes and then I’ll come over?”Cassian smiled, a soft one that set her heart racing. “Door'll be unlocked so come on in when you do.”Closing the door, Jyn turned to face her apartment. The cupcakes were sitting on the counter, only a few more left that needed to be frosted. Should she do her make up? Hair? Jyn chewed her bottom lip, trying to figure out her time frame before realizing it was pointless. She’s there to spend time with all her friends, not just him.Settling on that thought, Jyn set about getting ready. Nothing too flashy, a nice top, jeans, hair pulled back in a bun. Then it was time to finish frosting. She almost cried when she saw some of the frosting melting on the cupcakes, but it was too late now to fix it. She rushed the rest of them but figured the others wouldn’t care, probably more than likely to enjoy the cupcakes than care about the craftsmanship.Jyn smiled at the thought.Finally Jyn had the cupcakes stored and she was ready to leave. Making her way to the door, Jyn heard the sound of laughter from the other side. It was such a simple thing that no one else would question and yet there she was. Wondering. Her old life, the life she ran from, what if they found out? What if it caught up to her and they decided...“Jyn my dear, why are you waiting outside?”Chirrut and Baze walked up next to her, Baze holding some kind of dish that smelled amazing and Chirrut leaning on his staff.“Oh. Hey, why aren’t you two already in there?”Baze held up the dish. “Took longer than we had planned but we’re here now.”“I see you have brought something as well.” Chirrut eyed the container. Baze raised an eyebrow when she glanced at him.“Just cupcakes,” she opened the lid to show them. “Nothing special.”Chirrut shook his head. “A gift all the same is a most treasured thing. Your actions will speak volumes in the end.”Jyn stared at him, searching his face for something more about the wisdom he just offered her. But the only expression she got was one of genuine kindness. The one he tended to give her when he wasn’t focused on her and Cassian.“Thank you,” she settled on. “Are you ready to go in?”“After you.” Chirrut held out his arm in a sweeping motion towards the door.Stepping inside, Jyn froze when the laughter died down and all heads turned to her. She recognized most of them, though the robot in the corner was a new face. One that was not a welcomed sight though no one else seemed bothered by it.“Jyn!” Cassian made his way over to her, eyes only on her. “Thank you for coming.”“I told you I’d be here,” Jyn smiled at him. “Where should we put our food?”He looked at her confused, but recognition registered on his face when he looked past her. “I was wondering where you two were. Go ahead and put the food in the kitchen.”Baze stepped up next to her and nudged her with his shoulder. “This way.”The sound of chatter picked up again as she stepped into the kitchen with Baze. Baze made quick work of the kitchen, starting to heat up his own dish. Which left Jyn to stare at the cupcakes with melted frosting that were now placed on the island. What was she going to do?“These look delicious.” Bodhi’s hand came into view, blindly grabbing for one. “Did you make these Jyn?”“Yeah, I--”“Leave the woman be. We’ll bring these out in a minute.” Baze swatted at Bodhi who chuckled as he quickly retreated into the living room. Loud noise erupted from the area, but Baze seemed unfazed by it, focusing back on his food. Jyn returned to figuring out how to save her cupcakes when Baze spoke up.“So Cassian finally asked you to come over?”Jyn looked up in surprise. “Yeah. I was actually planning to stop by to drop these off when he came over.”Baze scoffed, but the corner of his lips were starting to curve up in a smile. “You know we told him to ask you from the moment we had picked him to host."" Baze scoffed and muttered under his breath, ""This man has fought in battles and couldn’t even ask a girl out.”Bix’s words from earlier crept back into her mind. “Oh, I’m sure it was nothing like that,” Jyn began, trying to dismiss where Baze was going but that didn't stop the heat rising in her face. “We do have different schedules after all, so we only run into each other a few times a week.”“Do you now?”Jyn kept her eyes focused on her melted cupcakes, chastising herself for revealing how well she knew his schedule.“Will you stop picking on her?”The two of them jumped, turning to see Cassian, followed by his robot companion, standing in the doorway.“I was only having a conversation.” Baze glared at Cassian, but there was no malice in his eyes.The two stared at each other for a moment, Jyn looking between the two men as she wondered what was going on. But then Baze nodded and picked up his dish.“The cupcakes look good,” he said to Jyn as he walked past her.“Thanks.”Once he was gone, Jyn turned her attention to Cassian, who was staring back at her.“What?”Cassian didn’t respond right away, instead looking at her a few moments longer, before stepping fully into the kitchen.“Sorry. About them.” He motioned with his head to where Baze had walked off.Jyn shrugged, focusing back on her cupcakes. “It’s fine. I know they mean well. Although,” Jyn couldn’t stop herself from skirting around her own curiosity as to why he only asked her to come over today, “they do seem very focused on asking me why I was only invited today.”Cassian coughed, bringing his hand to his shirt and smoothing it out.“Cassian has been asked that many times too, with the same reaction from him each time.” His robot companion finally spoke up as he also stepped into the kitchen. “K-2SO.”It took Jyn a moment to realize he was saying his name, what with the fact that he towered over her, head barely scraping the ceiling.“Sorry, this is K-2SO, though everyone calls him Kay for short.”Jyn continued to stare before finally mustering out a simple, “Hello.”K-2SO simply stared at her, and Jyn had the distinct feeling like he was searching her face for any sign of danger or cause for concern. She felt the hair on the back of her neck start to rise under his scrutiny.“Ok you get out too.” Cassian started to push K-2SO towards the door. “Make sure Melshi doesn’t eat all of the snacks before I come back.”K-2SO didn’t budget for a few moments, even as Cassian pushed on him. But whatever he was looking for in her he didn’t seem to find, because he tilted his head and let out what she assumed was a sigh.“The likelihood of that happening is only--”“Go Kay,” Cassian almost growled, glaring up at his friend who stared back at him.“Very well. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”He walked back out leaving Jyn alone with Cassian. She felt her heart start to race at the realization. What was she supposed to say? She practically called him out for not inviting her.“Mind if I have one?”Cassian was leaning against the island now, hand hovering over one of the cupcakes but eyes once again on her.“Help yourself.”Cassian picked one up but slowly made work of pulling off the wrapper. “I’m sorry,” he began, this time staying focused on the cupcake, “about not inviting you sooner.”“It’s really no big--”“Jyn.” A shiver went up her spine and she closed her mouth. “I did mean to invite you sooner. That time in the elevator, running into each other in front of the laundry room. But it never seemed like the right time.”Why would something like that be so difficult? Maybe he really didn't want her there? “It's just a party with friends.” She said, unsure of where he was going with this but the doubt creeping into her mind.“It's not about this. I was going to ask, but I also wanted to ask you something else.”Jyn looked at him in confusion. “What was it?”“I--” Another loud noise went up, making them both turn. Looking back, Jyn found herself caught off guard by Cassian’s relaxed smile. It seemed so foreign to her current emotions of fear bubbling inside her. “Sorry. What I was trying to say was, there was something else I actually wanted to ask you.”“Well, I’m here now. What do you want?” He pulled away slightly at her brusque retort, making Jyn feel bad, but she wasn’t one for games and this felt exactly like that.Something flashed across Cassian’s face, but it quickly was replaced with that relaxed smile again.“Would you like to grab coffee sometime?”Jyn’s mind went blank, the noise from the living room slowly being drowned out by her beating heart. It seemed so innocent, his question. One she would have brushed off if anyone else had asked, but the way he was looking at her, a sliver of hope started to form in her mind.“Like a date?”Cassian’s smile turned sheepish. “Yeah, like a date.”“I...” Jyn’s voice trailed off. The fact this was happening to her seemed so absurd. Why would he ask her? But even as the thought went through her mind, she found herself answering. “Yes, I’d love to.”“Great,” Cassian let out a nervous laugh. “I... I can’t believe it was that simple.”Jyn found herself smiling too, not quite believing what had just happened but for once her heart was guiding her thinking. “It only took you two weeks.”Cassian shrugged and opened his mouth to say more, when someone shouted from the other room, “Did you ask her out yet”, followed by multiple shushing noises. The two of them froze before breaking out into smiles again.“So...” Jyn began right as Cassian said “I was...”“Please,” Cassian said, motioning to her to continue“Well,” Jyn began, watching as he finally took a bite of her cupcake. She looked for any sign of disgust but was pleased when he raised his eyebrows and smiled. “I pass this café shop on my way to work, and it's always crowded. Maybe we could go there?”Cassian nodded, swallowing his final piece of the cupcake. “How about next Saturday? I don’t have to work that day.”“Sure. Noon?”“I’ll pick you up at 11:30,” Cassian said, a cheeky smile on his face.Jyn found herself smiling at his attempt at a joke. “I like the sound of that.”They settled into a comfortable silence, Cassian grabbing a couple more snacks and grabbing one of the cupcakes that he set aside in the kitchen.“For later,” he had told her, giving her a wink.The heat started to rise again in her cheeks, but this time Jyn didn’t hide her face, stead letting herself be comfortable with the fact that things were going...right. The two of them made their way into the living room. Jyn let herself sit next to Cassian, enjoying the warmth from where their bodies brushed each other. She may not have been one for sports games, but with him there, and the others, she found she was actually enjoying herself.Every so often she caught Cassian's gaze and was glad when each time he didn’t break contact, instead giving her a small smile. For the first time in a long time, Jyn let herself believe that things could work out. That this move, this leap of faith, was worth it in the end.

“You oughta be grateful for this opportunity,” grumbled Peli Motto, trying in vain to hold a shuddering R5-D4 still with one hand while she tightened the loose bolts of his plating. “Mandalore is the stuff of legend! If you help make some great discovery while you’re digging around in those caves, you’ll go down in history.”R5’s only response was a distressed whine; but before Peli could rebuke him further, she was interrupted by the roar of an engine across the hangar.While Peli herself was busy sprucing up R5 for his new mission, she had left her pit droids to attend to the tune-up of the Mandalorian’s N-1 starfighter. To her satisfaction, the sleek little ship was thundering with what almost seemed like a palpable fierceness and pride. That vessel was the mechanic’s finest work—not that she was ever actually going to admit that to Mando.It was at least gratifying that he seemed to recognize and appreciate her skill on his own. From where he sat nearby at a crate turned table, his helmeted head focused on the N-1 for a long moment before he turned to his child (who Peli still staunchly resisted calling by a name as silly as Grogu). At the moment the little green tyke was up to his outsized ears in a bowl of dungworms, happily feasting.“You hear that, kid?” Mando prompted him with audible enthusiasm. “That’s the sound of an engine in peak condition. You’ll have to learn that sound, because ships practically have a language of their own. The sounds they make can tell you everything you need to know about their condition. Hopefully it will be a long time before we hear any trouble from the N-1—but I’ll try to teach you the noises to watch out for anyway. Like the knocking of a blocked injector, or the hiss of a damaged coolant tube. A Mandalorian hunter’s ship is their life, so you have to know every centimeter of it.”Big brown eyes stared uncomprehendingly from above the wiggling worm-tail that protruded from the kid’s mouth.Peli raised her eyebrows. After all the time Mando had spent trying to convince himself that the child he loved belonged with someone else, it warmed her heart to see him embracing his role as a father at last—but she had to wonder if he wasn’t getting just a little bit ahead of himself. Maybe he hadn’t plonked a beskar helmet on the kid and started teaching him to kill people yet, but still… it seemed like kind of a lot.“Come on, Mando,” she chided him lightly. “Don’t you think he might still be just a skosh too young to hold stuff like that in his fuzzy little head?”Somewhere behind a dark visor, the stare the warrior leveled at her had to be just as blank as the kid’s. “He’s older than I am.”“And he also just said his first word today.” Despite Mando’s skepticism, Peli wasn’t about to let go of the fact that she was sure the kid had called her by name.“He understands more than you think.” The adoptive parent’s tone gentled, with a small fragile note somewhere within it that sounded faintly pained. He placed a gloved hand on the kid’s back; the movement pushed down the front of his tunic slightly, allowing the edge of the beskar chain mail beneath to catch the light of Tatooine’s suns and gleam brightly. “The life he’s chosen with me is a dangerous one. And even if we both keep managing to navigate those dangers safely… he’ll still be young someday when I’m gone. Before that time comes, I have to know he can take care of himself.”Between the way the kid stared up at his father with melting eyes and drooping ears, and the soft little whimper he breathed out, Peli needed no more convincing of just how much he understood after all.“…You’re a good dad, you know that, Mando?” she said softly.She might have been just a little bit glad her words were drowned out by the N-1’s engine gunning.

Chapter Text
There were three undeniable facts in Leia’s large galaxy.Luke was her brother, and she could trust him no matter what. He was a mess, but he always came through in one way or another.The Empire had to be stopped.And, finally, even when Luke or Leia failed or the plan fell apart, Ahsoka Tano was there to pick up the pieces. She’d drag them out of the mess the way she had when they were born and hug them at the end of the day and clean their wounds.As Leia stood with binders around her wrists and the diplomatic planet of Alderaan— the planet that was very much involved with the rebellion— floated before her and the rest of the Death Star, she had to pray that somehow Ahsoka would save her the way she always did. Luke may attempt some stupid plan, but for once, Leia wanted him to stay away.The brave part of her that came from Ahsoka and life in the rebellion told her that she shouldn’t want Ahsoka to come, either. She should find a way to get herself out of this and wish her family and any rebels far, far away from the battle station.With a Sith Lord holding her binders and Admiral Tarkin smiling in front of her, Leia wasn’t sure how that’d work out.She kept her eyes open and her posture straight, but she internally wished for Ahsoka to arrive. Vader didn’t know she had the force, so she kept up the careful shields that Ahsoka had been drilling into her and Luke for the past three years.Hopefully, Luke wouldn’t come anywhere near the station.Hopefully, Ahsoka was already aboard and waiting to strike as she always was.Ahsoka felt like a ghost on her own feet.All things considered, she essentially was.The faces of the dead clones— friends, brothers— wouldn’t leave her mind. She couldn’t stop seeing Jesse’s bleeding face beneath his helmet and the other hundreds of clones that had been brutally killed in the wreckage.The Jedi were dead; Ahsoka could feel it, and she’d seen it as the clones tried to kill her. As far as the Republic— Empire?— was aware, she was dead. She and Rex had buried the 501st at the wreckage and taken off. The cranial chip that ensured the clones carried out Order Sixty-Six didn’t assure service to the Republic, and such a devastating loss could make clones desert.Ahsoka said the lie repeatedly to herself and prayed that every Republic officer who saw the graveyard would assume the same thing. She pictured the clones who’d saluted her moments before the Order went out. They hadn’t even made it to the ground; the bridge exploded before they hit the moon.Ahsoka walked down the hallways of an Alderaanian ship like a ghost, a haze within the familiarity. She was so cold. It had been three days since the Order went out and everything fell apart. Three days in which Rex and her didn’t leave the starfighter both out of fear of what they’d find on any planets and in hopes of finding a surviving signal from one of their friends.It worked.Bail Organa reached out. Ahsoka had almost been convinced it would spell their doom, but Rex swore on every kind word Cody had ever said about the Senator that they could trust him.Rex just lost all of his brothers, but he was the one who was leading her. She didn’t know how he was doing it.Anakin, Obi-Wan, Master Plo, Shaak-Ti— everyone was gone. It wasn’t like when she left the Order and was simply away from them. They were dead, and they weren’t coming back. She couldn’t go back this time. The war had been futile, and the galaxy was in ruins.Senator Bail Organa awaited at the end of the hall, a grim look on his face as he greeted Rex. Ahsoka stood back slightly, her hands moving instinctively toward lightsabers that weren’t on her hips anymore. They were beside the crash, and she wasn’t getting them back.“Ahsoka Tano,” Bail said, curiosity and relief in his tone. “I’m glad to see you made it out.”She nodded, “Thank you. I’m relieved to have someone on our side.”The words were difficult to form. What was their side anymore, after all, when the war was done and the Sith ruled the galaxy? It wasn’t even Dooku or Grievous, who had terrorized them throughout the entire war. Chancellor Palpatine, whom the galaxy trusted and adored, was a Sith lord who played every side of the war—Ahsoka raised her chin and cut off her thoughts, sensing Rex’s wary look thrown her way. They were led to some sort of conference room.In one of the seats was a presence that Ahsoka hadn’t even sensed, not with the darkness clouding everything in the force. She stopped in the doorway at the sight of Master Yoda, her heart practically stopping in her chest.Someone had lived.Was he the only one?“Master,” she nearly whispered, despite not being a Jedi. This didn’t change that fact; if anything, it only affirmed it. How could anyone be a Jedi without a Jedi Order?“Ahsoka,” Master Yoda smiled. “Glad to see you have lived, I am.”Even in the darkness, it felt as if the haze in their small safe corner of the galaxy faded just with his presence. She almost felt foolish for thinking that the dark side encapsulated everything, only to be proven wrong by Master Yoda in the end.It would’ve been polite to return the kind words, but Ahsoka felt frozen in place. She knew she looked immature and like the child she was, but she couldn’t will herself to be brave at the moment. Everything was gone, and they were supposed to act diplomatically?She’d been the Padawan, the child they pushed into a war, so she thought that perhaps she deserved a moment of acting like one.“Are we the only ones?” she asked.Master Yoda saddened in a way Ahsoka had never felt before. If she didn’t still have resolve— somehow, even when it all felt crushed— she might have crumpled to the ground.“As far as we know,” Senator Organa answered for her.Ahsoka forced a nod. Rex was staring at her.“Something else there is,” Master Yoda said. “Not for me to tell.”He looked at Senator Organa, drawing her gaze to the man. Ahsoka hadn’t known Senator Organa well, but she knew that he and Obi-Wan— the thought of her presumably dead Grandmaster hurt— had been good friends. He and Padmé had also worked together on many things, which was most of the reason Ahsoka had agreed to accept his transmission.Silently prompted by Master Yoda, Ahsoka could feel the something else, but she couldn’t identify it. Everything was too hazy. She touched her hand to her forehead, wishing for the struggle to be over.“Come this way,” Senator Organa said.Rex stayed behind with Master Yoda. Ahsoka almost wanted to latch onto his armor the way she had once after one of the most gruesome battles she’d ever been in when she was still fourteen. She wanted to stick by his side and wait for Anakin, and then she’d make them both sit with her on the ship back.Only, there was no ship back, and Anakin… Anakin, the Chosen One, the powerful Jedi who was her Master and brother and friend, was dead.Ahsoka looked away from Rex and followed the Senator.She heard one of the somethings before they entered the room. She stiffened. There was something eerily familiar, and for what would be the first of many, she got a feeling that someone had done something horrifically stupid.There was a child crying rather loudly. Ahsoka watched the door slide open and saw the two white cribs, with two matching children in them.She hated that she immediately knew whose they were.Senator Organa stood beside the door, looking at the crying child as if he wanted to help her. Ahsoka almost didn’t move through the doorway, but she willed herself. Someone was in need.She had no clue how to handle children, but she moved swiftly to the closest crib and lifted the child out. She had light wispy stands of hair and sharp brown eyes that guaranteed some of her mother’s traits.She only started crying more.Ahsoka didn’t know Senator Organa well enough to look at him for help, so instead, she tried to rock the child like she was sure she’d seen Jedi do before. She tapped her tiny nose and brushed down the strange human hair with her callused hands. There was still blood and dirt beneath her nails, and it occurred to her that she shouldn’t be holding a child.Before she could hand Anakin and Padmé’s daughter over to Bail, the crying stopped. Ahsoka looked at the bright blue eyes, free of tears and staring at Ahsoka. Did she see anything?Ahsoka’s attention was drawn to the other crib, where another human child with the same face awaited. He also had blonde wispy hair, but he had bright blue eyes that she’d stared into a thousand times. Whether it was in the Temple, on the battlefield, or in the quiet of a medbay when they were both injured, those were Anakin’s eyes.She wanted to curse Anakin for being so stupid, but she couldn’t exactly curse the dead. It hurt too much.Ahsoka turned to Bail, her brow bones drawing together. She had a feeling she knew exactly why she was introduced to the twin children, even if she couldn’t possibly assume who had thought that was a good idea.She still had to ask.“My wife and I considered taking the girl, Leia,” Senator Organa said, his voice heavy. “But… it couldn’t be safe, could it?”Why was he asking her?“I wouldn’t think so.”He nodded.“What is the boy’s name?” Ahsoka asked, reaching down to tap his nose and hold his tiny pale hand.“Luke.”Ahsoka turned away, her eyes stinging. She hadn’t cried yet. She couldn’t possibly let herself break in front of all of these people, so she willed away the tears and swallowed the heaviness in her voice.“I saw the news, but… Padmé?”Bail sighed heavily, “There is no one else to take care of them. I’m sure we could find people, but…”“I’ll do it.”Ahsoka couldn’t be sure why she said it. In a moment of the emotion that Master Yoda would scold her for, she could only see the closest thing to parents she’d ever had in both of the children. They couldn’t be sent away to some strangers, where they’d never know how loved they would have been. How loved they could be.She didn’t know the first thing about children, let alone human children, but she’d figure it out. She owed it to Anakin and Padmé after everything they’d done for her.They’d hate that mindset, but they were gone, and ghosts didn’t argue.“Thank you so much.”For a horrible moment, Ahsoka regretted ever accepting Bail’s transmission.She’d never regret it again.As soon as she asked, Bail provided a hearty ship, credits, and false identities. Atop it all, he provided the information of a rebellion he wanted to build. Senator Mon Mothma of Chandrila was willing to risk as much as Bail. Padmé had apparently helped start it before the Empire even came about.Ahsoka gave her word that she’d assist the best way that she could when they were ready for her, then she walked back to the conference room where Rex and Master Yoda waited.Rex turned around, a stony expression on his face. He was just as sad as he had been for the previous days, but something was different. Something had shifted. Ahsoka looked at the obvious cause; Master Yoda.Then, she saw the glint of something in Rex’s hand.She’d already inferred enough. There was only one Jedi on the ship, and there’d been another one who was much closer with Bail than Master Yoda ever could have been. He was one of the noblest Jedi and people Ahsoka could possibly think of. There was no one who would join the fight against the Empire and Sidious faster than Obi-Wan Kenobi, so it was easy to assume that he was dead just like everyone else.His lightsaber in Rex’s hand only confirmed it.The light reflected off of the gold and silver metal of the hilt. The black grips were worn from the countless battles the saber had been held in.Rex set it in the hand Ahsoka hadn’t realized she’d outstretched, and she robotically hooked it onto her belt. She felt woozy. The ground felt unstable as if she could simply fall through it.“The children, you will take?” Master Yoda asked.Ahsoka nodded, her voice stuck in her throat.He nodded sadly, “A difficult task, it will be. Good, you will do.”Somehow, Ahsoka knew that Master Yoda wouldn’t be joining whatever rebellion Bail was forming. She swallowed the sob that was desperate to let itself out and nodded, taking a deep breath.“Thank you.”He hopped out of his chair and leaned on his cane far more than he used to, “Going into hiding, I am. May the force be with you all.”The suddenness of it hit Ahsoka, but she figured that with everything else, she shouldn’t have been surprised.“And you,” she bowed her head.Obi-Wan was dead. Anakin was dead. Ahsoka turned to Rex.She attempted to force as much typical friendliness into her voice as possible, but it felt like she’d never recover her usual tone, “Are you joining up?”“Of course…” he looked nervously out of the hall. “Do you really think you can take care of them?”She couldn’t see or hear either of the children, but she sensed them. They were calm. Not at peace, not after being born into a world of chaos, but the closest thing to it.“I don’t know, but I will. They deserve it.”She wasn’t sure if she meant that Anakin and Padmé deserved their children to be taken care of by her or if the twins deserved it, but either way, it was true. With their lineage, sending them to a family of strangers only felt more dangerous. They wouldn’t get a normal life, but she didn’t know what a normal life was. They’d be safe with her, at the very least.She raised her chin, “I’ll protect them with my life.”Rex opened his mouth and closed it again, “I… I’ll help you.”“I know that’s not what you wanted to do.”“It doesn’t matter.”“It does,” she turned to properly face him. “It matters. I think… if I’m going to do this, I need to learn to do it on my own.”“While joining the fight?”“It’ll be a slow fight, for a while, I think. I’ll go slow. What do you want to do?”She had a feeling she knew.“I’ll join, too. But… first, I want to try to find some of the boys. Save them. If it’s possible.”“It’s possible. They deserve it.”He opened his mouth as if he was going to argue before slouching.“I’ll visit. Frequently.”“If Bail gives me a big enough ship, you can get your own bunk.”He smiled as much as either of them could. Her arms twitched. She didn’t want to separate from Rex. She couldn’t imagine going on her own, even if the twins were with her. They were children, and she was about to be taking care of them singlehandedly.She stopped hesitating and hugged Rex, clutching onto his back armor plate like her life depended on it. He hugged her back, acting as each other’s lifelines.For two days, they practically didn’t let go.Then, two ships just for them showed up. One was much larger than the other, with more bunks than Ahsoka needed. There were stacks of datapads and children's toys and food. One of the rooms was prepared for human children.Ahsoka sat on the floor with twins on a mattress in front of her, and it finally hit her.Finally, she broke down.The twins were there to motivate her to pick herself back up, though.Luke’s legs couldn’t move fast enough as he ran through the streets of Mos Eisley. His dingy speeder hadn’t been working well, and now, he couldn’t even get himself to run faster.He weaved through people in the crowded streets, his travel bag bouncing against his leg painfully. He ignored it and continued running as fast as he possibly could. On another day, perhaps he’d have made a joke out of this.On any other day in any other situation, he wouldn’t be running this fast. He’d never regretted going to Tatooine before, but suddenly, he wished more than anything he’d stayed with Ahsoka and Leia and the rebellion.Leia had been captured.She hadn’t just been captured by some rookie Imperial squad whom she could trick into letting her go. It wasn’t anyone whom she could invoke Senator Organa’s name to.She was on the Death Star, the Imperial station that Ahsoka had been trying to figure out for years and that had just decimated Jedha and Scarif. As soon as Luke heard the reports, he’d wanted to leave, but his damn starship wasn’t functioning right.His heart felt like it was going to jump out of his chest by the time he reached his battered ship. He’d bought it with his own credits, not having told Ahsoka until he showed up one day unexpectedly in it. He’d replaced nearly every part and put more credits into it than he’d originally bought it for, and it was still a piece of junk.Now, he needed more than anything for it to work.He could hear Ahsoka’s voice in his head telling him not to do something stupid. He didn’t even know what he wanted to do. All Luke knew was that Leia was captured, and someone had to save her.He threw his bag into the small storage space and hopped into the seat, powering up the engine and controls. In a rush, Luke attempted to lift the ship off the ground.The engine only sputtered.It was probably a good thing it didn’t lift, considering he hadn’t even closed the hatch yet, but he needed to go. Leia had the Death Star plans that the Scarif crew supposedly recovered, so the rebellion would send a team. Preferably, he wanted to be with the team, but he didn’t care where he was as long as someone saved Leia. Right now, Tatooine was the last place he wanted to be.Usually, Tatooine was an escape. It sure as hell wasn’t the brightest place in the galaxy, and it wasn’t where anyone went for a purely fun time, but Luke had grown to appreciate it.When he and Leia were children, Ahsoka chose to send Luke and Leia to planets. She’d wanted to give them some form of socialization. At the time, he’d hated the idea of being separated from her, but that was exactly why she’d done it. Otherwise, neither he nor Leia would have ever learned how to act around anyone but Ahsoka.Originally, they'd both gone to Alderaan to be brought into a luxurious program for those without families that was funded by an even fancier academy that taught politics and formality. It was orchestrated by Ahsoka and Senator Organa, and Leia had easily grown close with the Senator and Queen. Unfortunately, Luke hadn't eased into the environment as easily, and he'd found it so overwhelming that he'd had to leave.In return, to ensure he still got accustomed to the outside world, Luke had been sent to Tatooine to be with his Aunt and Uncle. Anyone else would have said that he lost out on the good life that Leia got, but he knew that wasn’t true. They learned different things, but they taught them to each other. They made friends. She got to live luxuriously, and Luke got to be with part of his real family, those of whom had known his parents. They’d both been furiously jealous of each other, even if he eventually grew comfortable on Alderaan and she came to Tatooine.He still visited Tatooine sometimes. He’d still help out the rebellion when he was there by listening in on Outer Rim transmissions, but he got to work at the Tosche Station and keep his feet on the ground for some time.Leia didn’t go to Alderaan much, not when she could accidentally link the rebellion to the world in the process. By all accounts, Ahsoka’s ship was their home, but he and Leia had grown to love their Alderaan and Tatooine.Now, Leia was captured on the most threatening Imperial weapon the galaxy had ever heard of, and Luke was stuck on Tatooine because his engine wouldn’t start.He wanted to hit something.Instead, he took a deep breath and grounded himself the way Ahsoka had taught him. He had to stay focused. He hopped out of his starfighter and grabbed his bag, slinging it over his shoulder. He turned around, a plan developing, and-Nearly bumped right into the chest of a wookie. A dull roar sounded as the wookie backed up, hands flying out to the side.“Sorry!”“Hey, watch it!”Luke looked into the eyes of a man who was obviously a smuggler, alarm bells sounding in his mind. He had a blaster on his side, but he’d prefer not to use it.“Sorry, sorry! Didn’t expect anyone to be so close.”They were awfully close to his ship, though. The smuggler quirked a smile at his friend, but strangely enough, Luke didn’t feel a threat.“Yeah, actually, that was on us. I noticed your engine wasn’t working and, well, I’ve got a ship, The Millenium Falcon, fastest ship in the galaxy. We can give you a lift.”Luke laughed, “Yeah, and what do you get out of it?”“Credits. Ten thousand.”Luke laughed again, “Oh, boy, you must be in hot water. Work for Jabba? Pykes? Which is it?”A finger was in his face suddenly, but Luke sidestepped it.“Hey! That’s none of your business, kid. I offered you a ride, and you seem pretty desperate. Ten thousand or nothing.”The smuggler put up a good front, but the wookie’s uneasiness was obvious. They were obviously shipmates, and the smuggler was even more obviously in hot water with someone dangerous. He needed credits fast. Fortunately for him, Luke was even more desperate.He eyed his ship cautiously, “I’ll give you two thousand up front and… fifteen thousand when we get there.”Ahsoka was going to kill him for promising so many credits. Senator Organa could summon them easily, but she’d probably make him be the one to ask.She could yell at him all she wanted, as long as Leia was safe.“Seventeen thousand?” the smuggler asked coolly, but his elation thrummed around him.“You heard me. Do we have a deal?”“Yeah, kid. We gotta deal.”“Great,” Luke patted his starfighter sadly. “Give me an hour.”The smuggler clicked his tongue and turned to leave. Luke didn’t want to sell his ship after all the work he’d put into it, but he didn’t want to have to hide or secure it. Someone would steal it by the time he got back. Besides, he didn’t want to give away two thousand of his own credits. The ship would get at least half from the jawas.He hoped that Leia had over an hour. He hoped that there were rebel teams on their way to save her and that Ahsoka was leading them.As he prepared to contact jawas, a cold chill ran over his spine.He hoped Darth Vader wasn’t on the Death Star. He’d nearly killed Ahsoka in her fight with him three years prior, and she’d been stonier ever since. She never did tell them why.He and Leia were curious as to what had happened at the fight, but he didn’t want Leia to find out while captured. It was the last thing she needed.Hopefully, Vader wasn’t there at all.Luke had to hope, for Leia’s sake.

Chapter Text
Luke nearly had to run all the way back to the Lars homestead to find the Jawas. All he could think of was Leia, in some cell going through what happened when a rebel got captured— hell, when anyone got captured by the Empire.He didn’t want to think about it.He went as quickly as his failing speeder could get him. When he finally saw a sand crawler, he thought that he might have destroyed his throat by yelling for them to stop. They listened, even bringing out some of their products.They were about to be happy with him, and he didn’t even care. He just needed to go.“I’ll sell you this speeder and my starfighter, but they’ll both be in Mos Eisley,” he said, taking heavy breaths between each word.“Ut ikees dooka!”“Half your parts are junk! Give me a break here! I just want one thousand for both; an entire ship and a speeder worth of parts! That’d be your entire season business!”“Da Juwi not know Wauh Ai season ikees, Whitesun?”Whitesun. Luke sometimes forget that was the name he went by on Tatooine. He and Leia took dozens of different last names, depending on the place. Very few people knew them as Luke and Leia Naberrie. They’d both been Whitesuns, Organas, Tanos, and others more times than he could count. Rarely ever were they Skywalkers.They could be Organa’s next time, he just needed Leia to be safe.“I know plenty! Come on, it’s two big parts, you’ll make a fortune! One thousand.”“Fiviwi hundred.”“What?” Luke threw his arms out. “Eight!”They continued to bargain until a white and blue glint caught Luke’s eye. At first, he disregarded it as one of the jawas’ many droids for sale, but then he saw the waving golden droid beside the astromech.He left in the middle of the bargaining and ran over the R2-D2 and C-3PO, his jaw-dropping. How had the droids managed to get themselves into this situation? The last Luke had heard, they'd been with Leia.“Threepio! Artoo!”“Nyeta those Akriwi Mikee!” the jawa protested, waddling over between Luke and his droids.“These are my droids! You can’t scam me that way! Five hundred for the ship and the speeder, and I get my droids.”The jawas turned to each other, speaking in their language faster than Luke could understand. After a brief overwhelming stint on Alderaan, he’d first gone to Tatooine when he was six, but he’d never fully grasped jawaese. Aunt Beru swore that no human ever did.The one he’d been bargaining with turned back to him a moment later with a small case of five hundred credits. Luke might as well have been robbed in pure daylight, but he sagged his shoulders and took it. Leia owed him, once she was safe.“Master Luke! Thank the maker, it has been such a stressful-““Weren’t you two with Leia?” he shouted, pulling both droids aside and into his speeder. The jawas would get it from his drop-off point.“We were, but I’m afraid were attacked. We ejected ourselves. I do not know if-““I know, I know. Was she okay when you saw her?”“Oh, I believe-“Yes, but she was captured after, Artoo said for Luke, saving them a lot of time as they raced back toward Mos Eisley.Luke didn’t waste a moment after setting the speeder down next to his ship. He’d probably get a parking ticket of some sort, but the jawas would take the vehicles before long. They’d already paid him.“Surely Master Ahsoka can help us-““I don’t know where Ahsoka is,” Luke snapped as he rushed his droids to the landing bay.In truth, he hadn’t tried to contact her since hearing that Leia had been captured and was on the Death Star. She’d been doing an important mission to gather information about the Death Star itself for months. He’d tried to contact her after the destruction of Jedha and the explosion across rebel channels that it caused, but he'd received no answer.He could sense her, though. It was a dull feeling from across the galaxy, her emotions blurred to only a thin line of her presence that told him she was alive. It was enough.He could feel Leia, too. They were both out there.Luke found the smuggler named Han Solo waiting next to a light freighter. His first mate, whom Han had introduced as Chewbacca while they negotiated the proper terms of their agreement, was unplugging the ship from where it had been refueling.Luke looked at the damaged and mismatched thing and mumbled to himself, “What a hunk of junk.”Han turned to him with a sneer, and Luke shared a look with Artoo, but it seemed Han hadn't heard him. Luke felt the absence of his sister at his side heavily. She’d have agreed with him.“All right, let’s get out of here if we wanna get there within two rotations.”“Two rotations?” Luke wrinkled his nose. “That’s impossible!”He followed Han up the thin ramp of the ship, his large bag for traveling to Tatooine slung over his shoulder awkwardly. The droids followed, and Luke internally sighed with relief. As soon as he was up the ramp, Han turned with a fluidness that showed he was familiar with his ship. He stuck his finger toward Luke as if he was that much older.“Oi! This is the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs, kid. The Millennium Falcon. I’ll get you there fast enough, and then I’ll get my money.”Leia would have an absolute field day with Han if they ever met, Luke thought to himself. For all of their sakes, it’d probably be for the best if they never did. He backtracked the thought immediately; once she was safe, he could listen to as much of her sarcasm as possible.“Whatever you say,” Luke said, looking at the dirty walls of the ship.It wasn’t like the ship that they called home and had grown up on was particularly clean and orderly, and it certainly had quite a few replaced parts, but it wasn’t lined with dirt the way the Millennium Falcon was.Knowing that Leia was captured gave Luke a strong longing for home. Home was many places for him and Leia, but the ship was where they’d been primarily raised. It was always the place to go back to after they visited various planets. It was where Ahsoka helped start and build the rebellion, and it was the setting of a thousand happy memories.Luke vaguely remembered Ahsoka telling him and Leia stories after she finally named the ship, only after years of all of them living on it. Ahsoka’s montrals had still been shorter then, but even that memory was fuzzy. She told them that in their ship, they could walk through the sky; she’d named it the Sky Walker.Luke dropped his bag on the ground beside the game table and walked slowly into the cockpit behind Han, looking at the sudden expanse of space in front of them. He’d already said goodbye to Beru and Owen, but he wished them a second mental goodbye.He was going to find and save Leia. He couldn’t bare the thought of anything else happening.As the stars jumped away, Luke relaxed into the copilot’s seat. He wondered what was happening to Leia right now; he needed to meditate. After a moment, he saw Han Solo flicker a grimace toward him.Luke crossed his arms, “So, how does someone like you end up working under Jabba?”“Hey,” he snapped, “What does a farm boy know about making a living in this galaxy?”Other than the fact that a farm boy would know how difficult it was to make a living on any planet, Luke wasn’t technically a farm boy. He’d spent most of his life in space, and he definitely had more experience piloting than working with vaporators.“Who said anything about me being a farm boy?”Han made a show of looking him up and down, “You look like a farm boy, kid. Don’t tell me you’re Alderaanian and on your way home.”Luke laughed, “Wouldn’t that be nice? I’m not from Tatooine or Alderaan, for the record.”“I’d hope not. You’d be getting quite the culture shock, and I don't wanna be there to see it.”“Wow, gee, thanks. What about you, then? You didn’t answer my question.”Han stood, “Money is money, kid.”“Big on slaves for Jabba then?”“Even I have standards,” Han snapped. “It’s none of your business, anyway. Find something to do for the next two days, and stay outta my hair.”Luke was left alone in an unfamiliar cockpit on an unfamiliar ship while Leia suffered in Imperial capture. It rubbed him the wrong way and only made him feel antsier.He spent three hours tuning into different channels on Han’s radio to try to contact Ahsoka; he had no luck. He meditated for about an hour and found little success. It soothed him long enough to play a dejarik game with Chewbacca— who was scarily good at the game— and speak to his droids, but the relief didn’t last long.Luke passed out for about four hours and woke with a jolt, wondering where in the galaxy he was. He spent the day dawdling around.Eventually, he pulled out his bag in the small room he’d been given and dug around for a long moment before feeling a piece of shaak leather. Bail had wrapped Luke and Leia's sixth birthday presents in the soft material; Luke only knew what it was because he and Leia had to research it. Apparently, the creature was native to Naboo, where their mother was from. It felt fitting to wrap the small heavy piece of metal he now had in his palm within it.Slowly, Luke untied the leather, glancing at the door to ensure no one was about to barge in. A glint of golden metal caught in the dim light, and the shaak hide slipped onto his lap. Luke looked at the lightsaber for a moment, wishing to find comfort in it.He and Leia never got a chance to build their own lightsabers, not with Ilum and Jedha consistently under Imperial siege. It was hard to stumble across crystals when going to the places that might have them was far too dangerous, and it wasn’t as if Ahsoka could find them and give them to Luke and Leia. It didn’t work that way.When they learned how to wield a lightsaber— Leia was better than him, but he was better with the force— they trained with Ahsoka’s. She had two, after all. She’d stand at the front of the cargo hold with Master Obi-Wan’s lightsaber delicately clutched backward in one hand, directing Luke and Leia on how to wield her thin hilts.He’d never known why she always held the third lightsaber in her hand when she watched them; it wasn’t as if she’d need to defend herself, and if they ever got close to injuring each other she’d gently use the force if they couldn’t fast enough.Several times, Ahsoka had grabbed the lightsaber out of the drawer in her room and handed it to Luke or Leia if they were going into an extremely dangerous situation. Neither of them had ever used it without her present, and only Leia had ever actually hurt someone with it; she hadn’t touched it for months after.Luke remembered when Ahsoka handed Luke the lightsaber, simply to walk around Yavin with it. It was a statement, and it was one that had slowly trickled about like a rumor. Leia had stood across the cafeteria from him and smiled. She did it for their morale as much as she did everyone else’s after the two Jedi of the Phoenix Cell were lost.He traced his finger along the golden pieces of the lightsaber, holding his hand over the black grips. He spun it the way Ahsoka did, even if he could never master the backward grip if he tried for his whole life. He spun it back and held it out as if it was safe enough to turn on.Despite never knowing Obi-Wan Kenobi past the countless stories Ahsoka told, his lightsaber was always a comfort. Leia had always agreed.They knew that Ahsoka was given the lightsaber by Bail, but they had no clue what had led to that. Ahsoka didn’t, either. She used to tell them stories upon stories of Obi-Wan and his heroics. Not just his heroics, however. He could still see her smile when she'd tell lighthearted stories of Obi-Wan, not from the battlefield but from the busy halls of the Senate building or the civil towns of Outer Rim planets freed from occupation. When he'd stumble or embarrass himself in a way someone so composed never did. Ahsoka seemed to love those stories most.There was a different smile for her stories of seeing anyone else saving Obi-Wan or putting him in his place— only when it was friends, of course. He was the one who did the teaching, so for him to be told anything new must have been quite a shock.Luke knew nothing of the man beyond stories, but he smiled at the lightsaber in his hand. It felt like it gave him hope to save Leia.The air shifted, and he felt the change. They were getting close to Alderaan.With haste, Luke wrapped the lightsaber back up and set it into his bag. He threw the strap loosely on his shoulder and exited his room, his shoulders raised with confidence. He wondered if Obi-Wan walked that way.He walked into the lounge to find Artoo and Chewbacca playing a round of dejarik. Luke was awful at the game, but a droid was typically better. Luke smiled at Artoo, cheering him on with a thumbs up.It felt as if the temperature dropped significantly in a heartbeat.A heavy weight settled into Luke’s chest and grew into his limbs and heart, terror lancing through him. It was not his own, but it grew. Within moments, the fear and pain became a tidal wave in the force.Luke staggered and leaned into the wall, his hands flying to his head as his bag slipped onto the ground.The feeling subsided.Alarm bells rang in his head because that wasn’t how the force or emotions worked. It felt as if the air had been cut off to his mind, the sudden pain deafening.A voice registered in the back of his mind.“Kid! What the hell? What’s wrong with you?” Han didn’t sound as concerned as he was irritated.“Something bad happened,” Luke said, blinking away the dark spots in his vision to look at the room.Leia. Luke shut his eyes and felt for the string that was their connection, the one that was as familiar and old as he was. It was still there. It felt weak and tired, but he was getting closer to her. She was alive.He had no idea if she was okay, but she was alive.A lot of people weren’t.“Uh, yeah! You just almost fell over! Mind explaining what the hell that was?”Luke looked at Han and, for the first time, wished that he had Leia’s attitude; Han deserved it. Then, Luke’s eyes caught a gold glint of light on the floor, right next to his fallen bag. He hadn’t fastened it.Han’s eyes followed, too. He backed up, his hand going over his blaster.“Nevermind. What are you trying to push on me here?” he looked at Luke with the first sign of hostility yet.“It’s my Uncle’s,” the lie flowed off his tongue easily; in another life, Obi-Wan could have been his uncle.“Or you got it off the black market. Tell me the truth.”“I’m telling the truth,” Luke pushed himself off of the wall. “My Aunt on Tatooine wants me to bring it to my sister, on Alderaan. I thought we agreed there were no questions asked here.”Finally, Han let go of his blaster, “Fine, kid. Just don’t try to trip me up.”He had a very strong feeling Han could put together the pieces that he was with the rebellion. Luke crouched and picked up the shaak leather, beginning to wrap the lightsaber with much more care. Han had turned around and was muttering to Chewbacca.Luke paused just before tying the leather to hold it in place. His eyes flicked to Han and back to the lightsaber.He didn’t know how safe Alderaan would be, not with whatever he’d just felt.Slowly, Luke pulled the lightsaber free and hooked it to his utility belt. He’d changed into less Tatooine-styled clothes and was able to hide the weapon beneath his jacket after loosening a few straps. Ahsoka wouldn’t approve, but she wasn’t answering him. Leia needed help, and he expected trouble when he got there. This wasn’t like anything they’d ever been through before.He didn’t know where Leia or the Death Star was, but he did know that Bail and Breha would have a plan. He couldn’t bring a stranger to Yavin, so this was his next best option, and he had to hope it paid off.Luke and Han didn’t speak after Han saw the lightsaber, but it wasn’t as if they’d spoken much over the trip, anyway. Luke had overheard Han speaking to Chewbacca about paying off his debt, and Han asked why he kept using the radio. Small brief conversations were about the extent of their communication.When Luke heard the beep of the cockpit that signaled to exit hyperspace, he practically ran into the small space. Han was already there, and he scoffed at Luke’s hurriedness.Leia was still out there, still captured. It had been so long.Strangely enough, Luke felt her, though. It wasn’t merely their bond stretched over distance anymore. He could feel pure exhaustion, along with a deep sadness that he couldn’t place.He could feel Leia nearby. She was close.She-All positive thoughts ceased as Han brought the ship out of hyperspace in front of Alderaan and was immediately barraged with hundreds of asteroids.“What the…” Han muttered to himself before straightening.“Did we just come out in a meteor shower?” Luke asked. Chewbacca roared in what Luke assumed was agreement.“I don’t know, it’s not on any of my scopes!”Luke looked out into the expanse of space. Space was all he saw. He looked at the nav over Han’s shoulder, showing that they should have been at Alderaan.A horrible dread settled in his chest.“Our positions correct, but no Alderaan,” Han said impassively.In his mind’s eye, Luke could see the Royal Palace in Aldera, along with the University of Alderaan. He could see the mountains. He could see Leia running across a landing pad like she was made for the planet and hugging him when he arrived. He could see the faces of his classmates from his semester at one of the minor schools. He could see Bail and Breha.“Well where is it?” he asked Han, his voice betraying his panic.He already knew.The Death Star hadn’t blown Jedha and Scarif out of the sky, but the rebellion had said that it might have had higher capabilities. The energy readings said that it wasn’t even at full power when it decimated the former planets.Luke thought back to the quiver he felt in the force.“It’s been blown away, kid,” Han said casually as if a planet hadn’t just been vaporized. “But, I don't get it. Not even a thousand star destroyers have enough firepower for those.”“They don’t need it…” Luke felt weary.The scopes began to scream, and Luke’s dread only grew as it occurred to him why he still felt Leia. A TIE screamed over them. Chewbacca roared, and Luke suddenly wished he’d learned at least some Kashyyyk in his life.“They can’t identify us,” Luke said, grabbing Han’s shoulder. “Jam their transmissions!”“I know what to do, kid! I’m gonna get us over to that small moon. I don’t know what a lone fighter is doing out here, but-““No! No, no, you can’t! That’s not a moon!”“Well, what else would it be?” Han shouted.“Oh, dear,” Threepio muttered from behind them.Luke let go of Han’s shoulder, looking at the spherical station of mass destruction before him. Leia was aboard it. She was aboard it, and she might have had the plans to destroy it. He needed to save her.Luke kept his mouth shut while Han panicked, and when the tractor beam hooked onto them and Han couldn’t get out, he bid a silent mental apology to Ahsoka. It was a good thing he’d kept the lightsaber on his belt.He was going to save Leia himself. Maybe Han would help, but he wasn’t waiting for a rebel team to go in mostly for the plans. He knew how prioritization in the rebellion worked; hell, he’d developed much of the same mindset. However, this was his sister. He hadn’t seen her in months, but that didn’t change anything. She was in danger, and he was going to save her.He steeled himself as Han shut down the ship’s power. The Death Star was growing larger through the viewport until the transparisteel structure took up their entire vision. A chill ran across his skin. They were about to walk into the largest, most dangerous space station in known history. It had just destroyed Alderaan and decimated two planets. It held millions of Imperials.His sister was on it, though, and that was all that mattered. He could sense her; a dull star in the midst of an ocean of water. If no one got there quick enough, she could burn out.Han was letting out more curses than Luke knew in front of him.“This is different from just getting boarded, they’re not letting us go like this,” he muttered, flipping a dozen different switches as he moved around the cockpit.Chewbacca gave a lengthy response. A hangar became visible before them.Luke stood, “I have a plan.”“Thank the maker,” he heard C-3PO say from the lounge, where he and Artoo had been booted.Han scoffed, “There is no plan here, kid. We oughta eject that lightsaber before-““We’re not ejecting anything. We can get out of this.”“That’s not how this game works. We’ll be lucky to make it out alive in the next fifty years, especially if they catch you with that weapon.”“Don’t you have debt to pay?” Luke stood properly. “Jabba could probably get the Empire to give you to him! He wouldn’t be very happy then, would he?”Finally, Han stopped his frantic hurrying. He turned to Luke with narrowed eyes.“Fine, then. What’s your plan?”Luke smiled.They were on the Death Star.Luke Skywalker was on the Death Star, and he was going to find his sister. Han didn’t quite know that part yet, but he’d find out soon enough.Luke ducked lower in the floor of the Millennium Falcon as the stormtroopers stepped over it in their initial search. The Sky Walker had only been boarded by Imperials once, but Ahsoka had been prepared. She’d stowed Luke and Leia beneath the floor in the fourth, typically unused bunk and then put a panel over the door entirely. He knew how these searches went.When the initial wave of stormtroopers passed, he was the first to push the metal plate off. The technological search team came through quicker than he expected— they hadn’t done that on Ahsoka’s ship— but Chewbacca simply knocked them out. Luke smiled at the wookie while Han yelled for assistance.Luke knew that posing as stormtroopers was somewhat standard for rebels in the field, but he’d never done it himself. He was hardly considered a rebel in the field. He’d been piloting in dog fights since he was thirteen, but sneaking onto a space station wasn’t his typical work.He was nervous. Han wouldn’t admit it, but Luke could tell that he was, too. This was risky business, even for a smuggler; especially for a smuggler. Han didn’t know it, but he was working with a rebel. Luke knew how these things worked— for the most part, at least.The stormtrooper armor was lighter than it looked. The helmet was uncomfortable in a way Rex’s wasn’t, from when Luke was a child and tried it on. The armor felt as thin as it was; it wouldn’t stop any bullets from going through it.Luke felt like an imposter.Just as someone radioed into Han’s helmet, Luke tugged the droids and Chewbacca along and out of the ship. They slipped into a hallway, immediately running into two stormtroopers.Luke put one in a headlock while Chewbacca took care of the second. Really, Chewbacca probably could have taken care of both.“You’re good at that,” he said, slightly dazed. “We need to move.”They continued down the hall quickly. Threepio ducked his head into a room and announced it to be empty, allowing them all to move into it. Han was still behind, but Luke trusted that he’d catch up; or he’d mess up and screw up the whole operation, but Luke had faith that he wouldn’t. That’d mess things up for Han, too.Before Han could get in, Luke pointed at Artoo and the console at the back of the room and gave a hurried, “Find Leia.”“Who the hell is Leia?”Damn.The doors shut behind them, Chewbacca and Han suddenly standing beside each other like a unit.“My sister. She’s aboard this station, somewhere.”Han pulled off his helmet in the same fashion Luke had done moments ago, jutting his chin out and opening his mouth.“As an Imperial? Please, tell me she’s an Imperial.”“No! She’s captive, and I’m here to get her out.”“Are you kidding me?” Han grabbed Luke’s arm. “Was this all intentional?”“No, it wasn’t intentional, you buffoon! How could I have expected Alderaan to be blown into bits? I was trying to get there so I could get her help, but now we’re here, and I know this is where she’s being held captive.”“You coulda told me that!” Han let go of him, throwing his arms up instead. “Besides, if she’s here you’ll never find her.”Block AA-23. Cell 2187, Artoo said, right on time.Luke grinned at Han.“You can come with me, or you can stay and wait for the troopers.”“Oh, I’m perfectly content to wait here, but we need to get that tractor beam down if we ever wanna get outta here.”“Well I don’t see anyone else doing it,” Luke huffed, putting back on his helmet.Han grumbled something to Chewbacca, but a moment later, they both turned to Luke.“What’s the plan then, Admiral?”Luke ignored the mocking title and instead looked around the room. He felt the lightsaber bouncing against his leg from where he’d tried to conceal it beneath the stormtrooper blaster. It was a poor job, and anyone who looked too closely would see it, but he felt that he needed it in a place like this.Ahsoka had once preached that a lightsaber was a Jedi’s life, but her heart hadn’t been in it. Leia had called her on it, and Ahsoka laughed and admitted it was something Obi-Wan used to say that she didn’t exactly agree with. However, for the time, she’d reiterated it; perhaps in a brighter galaxy, they wouldn’t need it as their lifeline when they trusted in the force.Luke’s eye caught a pair of binders on the counter, and he shrugged at them.After a dicey exchange with Chewbacca, a stressful walk through the Death Star itself while posing as stormtroopers and praying no one asked them for identification, and a shoot out in the cellblock, Luke truly sensed Leia. Not the distant thread of his living sister or the vague outline of emotions from a distance, but Leia, nearby and weary.Halfway down the hallway, Han yelled that he’d have company. Luke didn’t hesitate to continue running forward. Leia was nearby. She didn’t sense him, not with his mental shields raised so high; Vader was on the same station, after all.When he got to the cellblock that Artoo told him to go to, he paused outside of the door. He hoped she was okay. Her shields were raised for the most part, but he could sense her emotions far more than she’d want. It was a testament to how worn thin she was.He opened the door and saw Leia lying on the hard, cold bench. She opened her eyes as soon as the door opened, leaning up onto her arm gracefully. She raised her eyes, opening her mouth to make some sort of remark to the stormtrooper in her cell.Luke cut her off by lowering some of his mental boundaries and pulling off his helmet.Leia’s tired, sardonic eyes widened and she stood. Luke didn’t know which one of them walked forward, but within seconds, they’d wrapped each other in a hug. Luke had been on Tatooine for two months and Leia had been on rebellion missions for four.Leia was always short, but she felt smaller. Her shoulders were too hunched together even as they hugged.Even if sneaking into the Death Star with no way out would spell Luke’s death, he was happy he’d done it, if only because he’d gotten to hug his sister one last time. She definitely needed it.“You shouldn’t be here,” she murmured into his shoulder, her voice hoarse. She pulled away first, ever the proper one.“Leia, I’m so sorry-“She turned away, squeezing her eyes shut with a sharp singular shake of her head. Luke promptly shut his mouth. She’d need to talk about it eventually, but it seemed that wouldn’t be happening now. For the sake of their survival, it was probably for the best.As if nothing had happened and she hadn’t been captured and put through the unimaginable, Leia fixed her big brown eyes on his. They were suddenly serious, and she’d rolled her shoulders back to fix her posture and make her look more formal. She looked the same way she did when she was about to give a briefing to the small groups of rebel cells she sometimes led or a speech in any politics course she’d ever taken.“Do you have the plans?”Luke’s mouth formed an ‘o’.“Uh…”“Luke?” she said, her voice suddenly much louder. “I sent them to Tatooine!”“Uh…” Luke repeated, looking around as if someone was there to save him. “I found Artoo and Threepio. They’re here.”If he didn’t have the plans, and Leia sent them to Tatooine, then they were in big trouble. The rebellion needed those plans, especially with what had just happened to Alderaan…Luke’s thoughts paused as he noticed the look Leia was giving him. Her jaw had dropped open and her face was crinkled criticizingly. It was the same look she gave him after he’d done something stupid.“Luke,” she said. Her tone was quiet but angry. “Tell me you didn’t just walk the plans to the Death Star back onto the Death Star.”Oh.Luke thought of the strangely quiet R2-D2 throughout the journey. Threepio couldn’t be trusted with plans, so it was a no-brainer as to whom Leia would entrust with the most vital information the rebellion had ever gotten.“Neither of them told me,” he said at a rapid pace.“You absolute-““How was I supposed to know?”“This is some rescue! Do we have a way out of here? Where are the droids?”“We left them in a room toward the hangar we came in on. We need to get the tractor beam down before we can go anywhere, though, but I think we might be in trouble.”“We?”“I… have a ride.”“A ride?” she said as she stole the E-11 blaster out of his hand. It was an obvious criticism of his ship falling apart, just like she’d told him it would when he'd wasted his credits on it.He followed her, looking at his stolen blaster, “I need that!”“You already have a weapon,” she pointed at his now unconcealed lightsaber. “Ahsoka’s going to kill you for all of this.”She peeked her head out of the cell before stepping out, managing not to trip on her Alderaanian dress in the process. He stepped out after her, seeing Han down the hall waiting for them.“She’ll be too busy making sure we’re alive,” he said quietly.As if his words triggered something, the door behind Han blew in. Chewbacca roared something. Han and Chewbacca both came running down toward Luke and Leia as the room and hallway exploded with blaster fire. Luke and Leia ducked behind the small spaces in the walls where the blaster doors functioned from. Unfortunately, they wouldn’t be closing the blast doors from here.“What took you so long?” Han practically screamed.Luke didn’t answer, instead opting to lean out of the way while Leia stuck her head out to shoot at the troopers.“This is your ride?” Leia shouted over the sound of blaster fire.“Hey, sister, you’re the reason he brought us in here in the first place!”Luke should have realized this was coming as soon as Han followed him to the cell block. He leaned back and stuck his fingers out to deflect several bolts away from Han and Chewbacca; Leia could handle herself.As they all leaned back for a moment of relief as red filled the hall, Luke wondered how they were supposed to get out of this. Was this it?Leia was always thinking on her feet faster than him.“If you’re not gonna use the lightsaber, I will!”Right. The lightsaber. Obi-Wan Kenobi’s lightsaber. Luke took a deep breath and set his hand on the black grips on the side, spinning it to sit in his hand properly. He set his left hand over his right and glanced at Leia. Her eyes were stuck on the red racing by, her knuckles white on the large blaster in her hands. Han was staring at Luke with concern.Luke jumped into the middle of the hall. The stormtroopers didn’t cease their fire, but he raised his chin and prayed that they wouldn’t need to.The first several bolts whizzed past him as he nearly subconsciously used the force to deflect them. He saw them smacking into him— his shoulder, his shin, his heart— but he was well-versed in using the force to dodge blaster bolts. He raised the lightsaber properly; it was just like when he practiced with a droid.The first bolt hit the lightsaber and flew into a wall far too close for comfort. He nearly recoiled, but he bent his knees and stood his ground in the center of the hallway.The second one hit the lower part of the lightsaber, near his hand, and went flying into the console in the room the troopers were holed up in. The third one deflected into the man who had shot it, and Luke didn’t have enough time to feel guilty as he continued to deflect the following bolts.“Don’t just gawk, help him!” Leia shouted across the hall. Matching red bolts started to soar toward the troopers from behind him.It felt like the world around him phased away momentarily. It was merely Luke, the force, and the stormtroopers ahead of him. Leia and Han were behind him, out of the danger area from the lightsaber but aiding him in the rapidly coming stormtroopers.Part of Luke knew that he should have charged forward and taken the troopers down up close, but he couldn’t bring himself to; not yet. Ahsoka would have already leaped toward them and started slashing, just like any other Jedi in such a precarious situation, but he kept his feet firmly planted on the ground.As he moved his hands rapidly to deflect the bolts, he heard the training holo that he and Leia used to eagerly watch. Ahsoka had somehow acquired it years ago, and it was one of the only existing holos of their father. The only time Luke and Leia had ever heard his voice.Luke heard him repeating the moves, counting up as he switched positions. One, two, three, four. Again. One, two, three, four. It wasn’t the same move each time like it was in practice, and it was much quicker, but Luke could still hear his father counting in the background.Finally, the never-ending flow of stormtroopers stopped. Luke tried to hit the last one, but he bounced the bolt into the light above them, shattering it. He dropped his stance to cover his head.Leia shot the last trooper.“And I was going to tell you good job,” she pulled herself out of the corner she’d fused into. “We need to find the droids and get out of here.”“Oh, do we?” Han threw a hand out. “I’d bet the whole station knows we’re here. If we can even get back to the Falcon, we’re not getting out of here unless someone gets down the tractor beam!”Leia turned slowly to Han, “Well. For all your obvious bravery during that fight, maybe you’d want to go take it down instead of merely yelling about it?”If they weren’t trapped on a literal Death Star, Luke might have hidden a laugh behind his hand. Leia spoke slowly, sassing Han to the highest level. Even Luke didn’t get spoken to in that tone very often.At least the alarms aren’t going off, Luke thought to himself. Leia, Ahsoka, him, and probably every other person with the misfortune of hearing the alarms absolutely hated them.“Well, Princess-““Princess?”“Yeah! Maybe you-“The alarms started to blare.Chewbacca roared something.Any sense of arguing disappeared from Leia as she snapped to attention, her hold tightening on the blaster.Han cursed in more languages than Luke knew.No stormtroopers came running from either side of the hallway, though. After two seconds of staring in suspense, Leia ran back into the control room and started pressing buttons.There was a small but subtle rock from above them, and some of the metal framings around them groaned.“I don't think is because of us,” Luke said slowly, afraid to jinx it.Leia paused what she was doing and turned to him sharply, a determined questioning look on her face, “Do you think-““I don’t sense her.”“Vader’s here, so she’d make sure no one would.”“Who?” Han shouted. “Sense? Care to let me in on the secret?”Leia scoffed, turning toward him, but Luke stopped paying attention as his comm crackled.“Luke, Artoo says the tractor beam in sector 7 has been destroyed,” Threepio said.“What?” he laughed victoriously. “Guys, we gotta go! It’s down!”“How?” Han said, looking at Chewbacca as if he’d know.Leia grinned— it wasn’t as wide as it could have been, not with everything that had just happened, but Luke was happy to see it— and smacked Han’s back as she followed Luke down the hall.“We’ve got some good friends,” she said.Han shouted another question, but it didn’t reach Luke’s ears. They took the route they came through, finding the wide hallway much emptier than it had been earlier. Those who were in it were rushing in every different direction, and most of them didn’t even notice them. Chewbacca took care of the ones who did easily enough.Luke ducked his head into the room they’d left the droids in, ready to yell at them to follow, only to find an absence of them. He made the mistake of looking worryingly at Leia while he pulled out his comm.She pushed past him into the room, checking the closet and beneath anything that lifted.“Threepio! Where’d you go?” Luke yelled into his comm.It took a moment for him to respond, and Luke shared the panic on Leia’s face.“We were discovered by stormtroopers and went to the hallway to return to the ship, but it appears that security has increased. Did you find the-“Leia had already marched over, but she stole the comm right out of Luke’s hand.“Threepio, are you secure?”“Leia! Oh, thank the maker, Artoo she's safe!”“Are you in danger, Threepio?” she repeated, her voice rising as her patience decreased.“Not at the moment, no. It appears the Imperials are waiting for you. There are quite a few.”“Maybe we’d better find a different ship,” Luke said.Han marched up to them, “No, no, no, that’s my ship, and I’m not leaving it behind!”“Is there any way around them? Where are you?” Leia asked into the comm.“Not that we can see. We’re simply standing in the hall, it seems the stormtroopers aren’t concerned with us. I’m not sure why.”“Now, now, don't take it for granted,” Luke said. From behind him, Chewbacca chuckled, and he grinned.“We’re just gonna have to fight our way through,” Han said it like it was easy.Luke turned to him, adrenaline surely the cause of the grin across his face, “Have you ever thought of joining the rebellion?”Han scowled, “I knew it. I knew you were trouble the moment I saw you.”“Luke,” Leia stopped him from digging himself into a further hole. “Do you want me to take the saber? This’ll be messy if we’re really just charging in and have no better plans.”So, she’d seen his hesitation, then. Luke almost wanted to hand it over, understanding the benefits of it, but he recalled her silence after the last time she’d used the weapon against another individual up close. With everything else Leia had just been through, she didn’t need that. He was the one who truly desired to become a Jedi, anyway. He’d need to use it sooner or later.“I got it.”She nodded, “No one has any other plans?”No one spoke.“We’ll run in with guns blazing and up onto the Falcon, then,” Han said. Luke wondered if it seemed so simple because he hadn’t grown up in the rebellion. Simple plans didn’t usually work out.“Do we have a distraction?” Leia asked.“The lightsaber will be a pretty big distraction. You two run while everyone shoots me.”“Sounds good to me,” Han shrugged.Leia gave him a stern look, “That’s suicidal. You’re coming with us. We’re just gonna run.”If they didn’t die, Ahsoka was going to kill them.“Good enough.”With their weapons in their hands and ready to be utilized, the four of them ran through the hall. Just as Threepio had said, he and Artoo were stationed at the end of one of the many hallways leading into the hangar. Han started shooting before the troopers even saw them.Luke raised the lightsaber like he’d done it a thousand times and deflected the first few bolts.Things happened very quickly, then.They were all shooting and deflecting bolts back. Chewbacca was using his impressive bowcaster. The alarms were still blaring.Across the hangar, in the opposite hallway, Luke felt a horrifyingly familiar presence begin to approach. He saw the ignition of a bright red lightsaber and felt both his and Leia’s hearts drop.There was the sudden smell of jet fuel.The sudden scream of engines rapidly decreasing in speed.All of the stormtroopers turned away from them and to the expanse of space outside of the hangar. As if out of thin air, a starfighter whipped around the corner.Luke and Leia barely had enough time to turn to each other with a smile before everything moved as a ship slammed into the wall of the hangar, an orange figure jumping out of the ship before it could explode into pieces.




Notes:

apologies for the disproportionate chapter lengths thus far, they'll even out to about 5k per chapter within the first few! also, i would like to preface that this fic won't just be a rewrite of a new hope with some minor changes to fit the au-- i know this chapter appears to be such, but i personally dislike doing that, so to anyone else who might find the thought of an almost exact movie retelling boring, there will be turns from the plot of the movies :)thanks for reading! <3

Chapter Text
“I like Alderaan. I made a friend named Amilyn, and there was a droid named Lola that came with me to class.”“Was Lola an astromech like Artoo?”“No! I… I don’t know what she was, but she was tiny and she flew with me everywhere. She kind of caught me when I fell out of a tree!”“You fell out of a tree?” Luke shouted from the other side of the couch, where he was building a toy starship he’d gotten on Tatooine. Ahsoka made a mental note to include toy ships in her budget for the kids.“Uh-huh!” Leia sat up from where she’d been laying on Ahsoka’s lap. “I climbed lots of them! Amilyn said she does it all the time. And, Ms. Breha said she grew up doing that.”Ahsoka smoothed Leia’s hair from its loose curls; the atmosphere of Alderaan did something to it, even if she still didn’t quite understand hair.She’d missed the twins.Sending them to different planets had been stressful but necessary. Initially, she’d gone with them both to a small town in the mountains on Alderaan, but she hadn’t been able to stop looking over their shoulders. The twins had felt Ahsoka’s stress.It wasn’t as if they’d never been on solid ground before. It was the fact that when they were on solid ground with a sky over their heads, Ahsoka was on alert and drilled awareness into them. The planets they did go to weren’t familiar, and they never returned. They needed some sort of solid foundation, and that included socializing with others their age. They needed to talk to more people than her, Rex, and the few others who knew she took care of them.Ahsoka sent them both to a school in Aldera within an orphanage, where Bail and his wife mostly looked after them, but Luke had been far too overwhelmed with the city. Leia was overwhelmed, but she was excited enough to look past it.Instead, Ahsoka had reluctantly taken Luke to Tatooine, where he’d thrived with his Aunt and Uncle.That had been four months ago, and they were finally back. Ahsoka had picked Luke up first before Leia was dropped off by Captain Antilles, and Leia hadn’t stopped speaking since she got back.They’d missed each other, Ahsoka could tell.“What’d you do on Tatooine?” Leia asked, overpronouncing each syllable of the planet's name.“I learned to farm water. Aunt Beru taught me how to cook, too! And, she gave me all these ships.”There was a collection of toy ships scattered across the floor.“Farm water? There were lakes in Aldera.”Ahsoka held in her chuckle, knowing that it’d set off a whole lot of questions. She couldn’t explain the humor in the seven-year-old not understanding the dryness of Tatooine or the bluntness of her latter claim.“There’s no water on Tatooine! I don’t think it ever rains.”“That’s so weird!”“There’s no water in space, either, though,” Luke held out his toy as if it was a representation of space.He wasn’t wrong, technically.Leia took the toy and turned around to show it to Ahsoka, nearly smacking her in the face with it.“Careful, careful.”“Don’t break it!” Luke reached across Leia to take it back.Even as a potential argument began to break out, Ahsoka’s heart settled. She’d been worried about them, especially separated. Technically, it was safer for them that way, but they were a unit. Even as Luke stole his toy out of Leia’s hand and she snapped the wing off, generating tears in Luke’s eyes.The ship had been too lonely without them.It had simply been Ahsoka in a ship full of children's toys, scattering the lounge with holos carelessly as she did her work. It was her usual routine, but she usually had to be a bit neater. Rebellion secrets were still rebellion secrets, and the twins couldn’t know them. She’d trust them eventually, but for now, they were seven and would run around spewing them at the first person they saw.They’d be going away again eventually. The summer on Alderaan had ended, and the new farming season on Tatooine had just started. Eventually, they’d go back.For now, Ahsoka let the twins settle across the room from each other in their respective pouts and set about fixing Luke’s toy.As Ahsoka spun her Clone War era y-wing that Rex had lent her around the Death Star, she caught sight of the hangar that she could feel the twins in. More dangerously, she could feel Vader in it.She dropped the fuel in an attempt to keep it from blowing up once it crashed and yanked on the throttle, trying to slow the ship down as fast as possible. It nearly threw her into the controls, but she’d gotten the timing right; the ship had just soared through the artificial atmosphere that was on any ship with an open hangar.She popped open the dome and jumped out, the ship crashing into the wall with a scream. In the brief second that Ahsoka was in the air, she could see Luke and Leia at the edge of a hallway, looking at each other with what Ahsoka knew was a knowing look.Of course, Luke had found his way there. It was a topic for another time; a time when Vader wasn’t beyond the dust of the explosion. She’d tried to aim the ship toward him, and she’d successfully blocked off his hallway, but he was still there.Had he found out about Leia? Luke couldn't have been there long, but the possibilities were endless. She’d trained the twins in protective force skills as much as possible, but Vader’s talents exceeded even Ahsoka’s. Their raw strength in the force only meant so much in the face of power that paralleled their own.Ahsoka’s feet hit the ground, and she cut down the several stormtroopers that hadn’t run at the sight of her ship. She weaved around the light freighter in the center of the hangar that her ship had narrowly avoided, heading for the hallway she’d seen the twins in.She could sense them moving through the cloud of dust that Ahsoka had just created. They needed to get out.Finally, Ahsoka saw Leia, a wave of relief flowing through her. She’d just sensed her, but she didn’t feel particularly okay. Physically, she was all in one piece, and that was enough for the moment.Everything about Leia’s appearance seemed to scream Alderaan, and Ahsoka’s heart crumbled at everything she had just been through. She wasn’t Alderaanian, but she might as well have been. Her hair was in two buns and her dress was one of the Alderaanian upper class. She looked like someone who had just lost her home planet.Luke appeared beside her, and both of them turned to Ahsoka. Luke was clad in stormtrooper armor, which told Ahsoka enough about how rushed his plan to get Leia had been. If he was going to be stupid, he at least needed to be smart about it.“Ahsoka,” Leia said, whirling to see her.She didn’t look right.One of her hair buns was collapsing. Her dress was stained with carbon scoring. Her shoulders were tense like she was about to give a speech, even though they were in battle. She had on her best brave face, but it wasn’t the situation for it.Ahsoka cursed herself for not being there to stop her from being captured.She stopped beside them and put a hand on each twin’s shoulder. This wasn’t the time for hugs.“You’re both okay?”They weren’t children anymore, not at eighteen years of age, but they looked like it to her. Luke’s shoulders had sagged in relief, and even Leia had let down part of her mask.They both nodded. Leia looked away, but Ahsoka saw the shine in her eyes.“Vader’s here,” Leia said after swallowing.“I know, that’s why I came to get you two out. Do you have the plans?”“In Artoo,” Luke said, giving a cautious look to Leia that Ahsoka didn’t want to know the context of.Ahsoka looked up, glimpsing the stormtroopers recovering. The dust was clearing, and a red lightsaber was visible.“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” a man with a Corellian accent shouted, waving his blaster around. There was a wookie behind him that Ahsoka swore was familiar.“Calm down, she’s with us,” Leia snapped.Luke said, “He’s our ride.”Ahsoka nodded firmly, looking at the light freighter. Luke and Leia's supposed ride shot two stormtroopers that were trying to return to guarding the entrance.“Go.”“What about you?” Leia asked as the Corellian and the wookie ran toward the ship.“I’ll find a ride.”“Vader’s over there!” Luke shouted, pointing at the mass of darkness slowly moving past Ahsoka’s wreckage.“I know what I’m doing,” Ahsoka said sternly to them both, pointing at the light freighter.She didn’t plan on fighting Vader.Leia’s hesitation was a testament to how much her time on the Death Star and the destruction of Alderaan had already messed with her. Luke had always been the softer one, but Leia touched his wrist and pulled him along. R2-D2 and C-3PO scrambled up the ramp behind them.Ahsoka watched the twins as they ran toward and up the ramp. Just as it was closing, right before Luke disappeared from sight, she saw a golden glare of light from Luke’s side.She straightened, looking to where Vader had also just seen the same thing.Darth Vader, the man who had once mockingly told her how he’d killed Obi-Wan, had undoubtedly just recognized Obi-Wan’s lightsaber. It was being carried by a random kid that Ahsoka had just openly shown affection for.The ship took off, the engines blowing air at everyone. Ahsoka took the moment to disappear into the hallway.Even if Vader hadn’t learned of Leia’s force sensitivity and connection to Ahsoka— Ahsoka had to pray he didn’t know exactly who her parents were— he’d just seen the boy who broke Leia out carrying Obi-Wan’s lightsaber. Ahsoka didn’t know what else he could have seen, but this single detail implied enough.Ahsoka didn’t think that the ghost of Anakin Skywalker would have enough of a brain to put together whose children they could possibly be, even when Leia’s big brown eyes had reflected Padmé’s since the day she was born and Luke’s resolve to do the right thing could only be attributed to one late Senator. It was still a risk.He knew who they were now, and there’d be an investigation. Ahsoka didn’t want to know what the investigation results would yield, but she’d need to keep an eye on it.She ran through the hall, appreciating the lack of stormtroopers after they’d all rushed to TIEs and the hangar she’d just destroyed when she began taking out turrets. It had been difficult to find the tractor beam and fully destroy it from the outside, but it had allowed Ahsoka to see the placement of the hangars.The Death Star was no star destroyer, but the subdivisions mostly had the same layouts. Ahsoka knew exactly what path to keep to get to a hangar that should have at least one shuttle remaining for her to steal. It wasn't as if the shuttles ever joined the fights, so they’d be open.She wondered if Vader was trying to chase her in his heavy metal body or if he was already hopping into his own TIE. She couldn’t beat him in space, but she could jump to hyperspace before he found her.As she amassed several stormtroopers behind her, she took a turn and immediately slammed her lightsabers into the door controls. When she turned around, she saw that there was a bridge that had to be extended for her to get across the wide cavern blocking the next hallway.Well, star destroyers certainly didn’t have those.Thankfully, Ahsoka didn’t need the bridge controls that she’d just destroyed. She backed into the door and ran off the ledge, jumping to the other one.She could sense Vader around the corner, nearby in another hallway.Ahsoka didn’t stop. She didn’t try to meditate and sense if there were any scraps of familiarity left in him; that was what she’d done before the truth of his identity had been confirmed, and now it was useless.She ran into one hangar and found it to be empty. Without hesitation, she turned down the hall and continued toward the next hall.She could sense Vader, but he wasn’t coming closer. He wasn’t anywhere near the hangars, from what she could sense; if anything, he was going further into the Death Star, where he certainly wouldn’t be getting out from.Ahsoka stuttered to a stop in the entryway of a hangar, a perfectly good shuttle within her vision.Vader wasn’t chasing her.Darth Vader, formerly Anakin Skywalker, was letting Anakin Skywalker’s former Padawan go. Ahsoka not only knew his identity but had already tried to kill him. They’d both failed to kill each other, really.As far as Vader had known for some time, Ahsoka had died in the destruction of the Temple on Malachor. He didn’t know that Ezra Bridger had saved her life in a turn of events in the force that even her experience on Mortis couldn’t have prepared her for. He now knew she was alive, and while this was her first time encountering him since their fight three years prior, if she’d ever known anything about Anakin Skywalker, then she knew he was furious. No one ever came out of a fight with Darth Vader, especially not knowing his identity. Based on his reputation with how he acted around clones, she could assume that he hated anyone from his past life. She had to assume she was the only living person other than the Emperor who had been close with Anakin and knew what he became.Yet, Darth Vader was leaving the Imperials whom he had to know were incompetent to capture her while he walked away. Her thoughts circled to every worst-case scenario or plan he could come up with, but the only answer was Luke carrying Obi-Wan’s lightsaber and whatever he may have sensed from Leia.Ahsoka ran to the shuttle. Her kids were going to be the death of her.It wasn’t as if they even knew who Vader was, however. Ahsoka hadn’t told anyone. She knew that it drove both twins crazy, to know that Ahsoka had been in such a serious fight and had come out seeing Vader as more than a threat. Leia, particularly, was rather outspoken about it, after inheriting so much of her father’s blunt curiosity.Once, Ahsoka had taken pride in that fact. Despite earning her appearance and finesse in politics from her mother, Leia’s personality was often a mirror of Anakin’s. Luke had his father’s looks entirely, but his kindness most often reflected Padmé’s.Anakin’s fall didn’t make Ahsoka any less proud of the twins or love them any less, but it did make her mention their parents significantly less often. She’d accidentally stopped all of her once frequent stories of the Jedi and Clone War after discovering Vader’s identity.They deserved to know, and she’d tell them one day. Ahsoka consistently felt as if she’d dug herself into a hole by spending the twins’ childhood serenading them with stories of their father, only for him to have secretly been the Sith Lord who helped to destroy the galaxy.For now, Ahsoka had kept her knowledge to herself. Not even Rex knew; she didn’t want to destroy many of his best memories. The twins’ looked up to their parents, and Ahsoka couldn’t bare to shatter that legacy yet.It was immature, and it wasn’t the adult and guardian she was supposed to be, but telling them would feel like shattering her own perception of Anakin, too. It was already dust in the wind, but a part of her had never left the clone graveyard after Order Sixty-Six, and that part kept her from revealing Anakin’s identity.She’d tell them, one day. Perhaps the day was nearing.Ahsoka was able to outmaneuver the TIEs easily enough and jump to hyperspace, her course set for Yavin.As she stared at the blue haze of light speed, Ahsoka felt her stomach drop. Vader knew about Luke and Leia. He might not know much yet, but he knew enough to ignore her in favor of researching them.It was the worst possible scenario, and it was developing before her very eyes.Leia felt like a tree without leaves, swaying in the wind so hard it looked like it’d snap and fall onto the ground below it.Physically, she was intact. She was sitting on the bench in the lounge of the ship that Han Solo had deemed the Millennium Falcon. Her shoulders were raised and her chin was high enough to portray confidence. She’d fixed her collapsing hair bun at some point, but she couldn’t exactly remember when.Her skin had begun to tingle at some point while she was running with Luke and Han. It had grown into a dull stinging, particularly on her arms and neck. Not many people made it out of Imperial torture, so it wasn’t as if there was anyone to refer to ask if this was normal.Leia could see trees swaying in the wind during the winter season of Alderaan. She could see the kind woman who tended the gardens of the home Leia stayed at, politely telling her that the tree would be fine. Sometimes, if the weather got bad enough, Leia would see stakes in the ground with some sort of bungee around the tree to keep it from collapsing. They always rose back up, and the stakes would be taken away by spring.Her mind trailed straight from the thought of the trees to the kind, loving faces of Bail and Breha. She stiffed and blinked away the tears that rose.She thought of the towers of Aldera. The mountain that she’d wanted to hike one day, even if she wasn’t the Princess of Alderaan.She thought of Ara Organa, the Princess of Alderaan. She thought of every game they’d ever played. All of the trouble they got into. Ara was the only friend who ever came aboard the ship that Luke, Leia, and Ahsoka called home. The only one who knew about Ahsoka.Leia could see herself running through the halls of the castle with Ara, a castle that was now nothing more than dust in space.She sat up straighter and swallowed.""Stop staring at me,” she said, the words weaker than she’d meant.She’d already shaken off Luke’s attempts at comfort more times than she could count. Now that he’d given up, he’d resolved to simply look at her every time her roil of emotions got through the force shields that never truly worked when it came to him.He’d resolved to sit in the corner and try to reach Ahsoka from Han’s radio. After she’d snapped at him for the dozenth time, Han had finally disappeared somewhere. Even Threepio was quiet. He’d almost walked toward her, but she’d shut him up before he could offer condolences. She couldn’t handle it.Luke continued to stare, his mouth open as if he was going to say something. Leia had a feeling there was nothing polite to be said.She rolled back her shoulders for the thousandth time and shut her eyes, blocking out images of Alderaan and instead picturing a mural of Padmé Amidala. She’d been a Queen at fourteen, sitting on her throne during the Invasion of Naboo, and her posture had still been perfect. Her people were being attacked over a mere tax dispute and the Republic was doing nothing to help, and she’d still been the perfect picture of elegance, all while solving the problem.Leia wondered if this was even a fraction of the pain that Ahsoka still lived with.A culture, gone. A planet, gone.She wasn't sure if it was cruel to even compare the two. What had happened to the Jedi was awful and unimaginable. Leia had never even thought that she’d be able to understand the pain Ahsoka and the few other survivors lived with, and that wasn’t a fact she’d ever been disappointed over.Staring at the wall with her prim posture, vaguely aware of how out of place she looked yet holding onto her politeness like a lifeline, Leia couldn’t possibly imagine how Ahsoka had taken her and Luke in.The comm Luke had been incessantly fiddling with suddenly broke out in static. Leia instinctively turned toward it, straightening her posture even further.Even if she felt too much of a mess to be checking the radio with Luke, she was worried for Ahsoka, too. She’d only fought Vader once before, and things had shifted after. It wasn’t as if Luke or Leia had ever been near him before, either.Leia could still feel her own dread the moment she heard the mechanized breathing after the Alderaanian ship she'd been aboard was captured. She could feel a dark satisfaction around him, the consistent hatred so strong it felt like it’d strangle her into oblivion. Leia had read countless reports about Vader, but nothing compared to having him up close.She’d shoved every lick of knowledge about the force and her own abilities as far down as she could. Somehow, in an act she didn’t think she could ever replicate, she’d kept her shields down to hide their existence while concealing her abilities in the force. Vader had only seen her fear, but he hadn’t known what the largest culprit of it was.She wasn’t even sure if it had worked.“Ahsoka?” Luke said into the static, tuning the radio slightly in an attempt to clear it out.“Codenames.”He looked back at Leia, his concern outweighing his ability to think, “Huh?”“Codenames,” Leia repeated loudly.“Oh-““Red 5?”Suddenly, both Leia and Luke were alive. Leia stood and rushed beside him, looking at the radio that Ahsoka’s voice had just filtered out of. It was like they were children again and she was on a dangerous mission, except Rex wasn’t behind them as their babysitter listening with just as much anticipation.“Affirmative,” Luke stuttered. “Are you safe?”“Affirmative, heading to base. You all make it out in one piece?”All to conceal the fact that they were twins; two siblings, two people to be at risk of being discovered. This was the first time that all said over a transmission actually applied to other people, even if Ahsoka didn’t care for Han and Chewie.Leia eyed the hallway and saw Han Solo standing there, watching them with a raised eyebrow. She wanted to smack the look off of his face. She also wanted to collapse into a ball on the floor and never get back up.“We did. We’re heading to base, should we not?”“It’s up to you if you think it’s safe or not.”Luke looked at her, but Leia didn’t look away from Han. He scoffed and turned around, walking back into the hallway.“We’ll meet you there, I guess.”“Good. Fulcrum out.”Luke frowned at the short transmission, but this was protocol. The fact that Ahsoka hadn’t been using a voice modulator said more than she could have over a transmission; she was on a stolen ship, and she was taking it to the base. They had one more stolen Imperial ship to use.“So, that’s the lady who nearly killed us all back there?” Han had appeared again, it seemed.Leia didn’t think she typically had a short fuse, but she was beyond her limit. Atop every other awful thing that had just happened, she didn’t need some callous pirate making their lives more difficult.She whirled around to face him, “That lady just saved your ass back there, so you’d better show her some respect.”“I coulda gotten myself out of there, and we wouldn’t have been there if you didn’t make your brother come save you!”“Believe me, I didn’t make my idiot brother run onto the Death Star without a plan!”“Uh…” she saw Luke open his mouth out of the corner of her eye but ignored it.She lowered her tone and stepped closer to Han, “That lady who just saved us all is going to be the only reason you and your disgusting ship aren’t thrown into a cell when we land.”“Oh, yeah,” Han scoffed, “the rebels! They’ll save us all, surely!”“Is your memory too short to recall the Imperials who were just ready to blow your head off?”“My memory is long enough to remember the seventeen thousand credits that I was promised for coming all the way out here, and now look where you’ve got us!”“If money is all that you love, then that’s what you’ll receive.”She turned away from him slowly, giving Luke a searing look at the hefty price that he’d promised a pirate. She wasn’t sure how they were supposed to pay it when Alderaan and the funds they’d been able to provide were space dust, but she couldn’t force herself to think about it yet.She rushed past the droids and into the cockpit, uncaring of what Han Solo thought of her being in the cockpit. For a short moment, tears pooled in Leia’s eyes, and she thought she was going to break down right there.Miraculously, she pushed them down and sat firmly in a seat. Artoo visited her for a short amount of time, and she checked that all of his databanks were secure. The plans were there, and they were about to bring them home. She was now more certain than she was when she was captured that the Death Star absolutely had to be destroyed, no matter the cost.She didn’t move from her seat until she felt the calm allure of Yavin. Everyone came rushing in shortly after.Han barked something at Chewbacca— he was kind, Leia wasn’t sure how he tolerated Han— and Threepio was anxiously talking about how they shouldn’t have trusted Han. Luke sat beside her, giving her a look equivalent to a tooka who didn’t have dinner. She ignored it.The stars moved back into place, and Leia looked wearily at the forested planet before them.“Quite a place for a secret base,” Han murmured.“If you tell anyone-““I’m not gonna tell anyone, calm down, kid. I think it’s suicidal to fight the Empire, but no one really likes them, anyway.”Leia appreciated Luke saying it so she didn’t have to. Besides, Han’s response took away the sad tooka expression he’d had, and she didn’t want to look at it anymore.Luke directed Han to the central base that they always went to. Leia knew Bail wouldn’t be there, she knew that he’d been going to Alderaan, but part of her still looked forward to seeing him when she walked in.Rex would be there. Mon would be there. Bail and everyone else who had lived on Alderaan wouldn’t be there, and it broke Leia’s heart.Was Ahsoka there yet? She’d see through Leia’s facade instantly, but Leia wouldn’t even mind. She wanted to hug her and never let go, to be able to fall asleep with her in the lounge of their ship like she had when she was little.They neared the ground, and slowly, the Temple that they used as the central base came into view.“We have to tell them it's us,” Leia leaned in the center of Chewbacca and Han, pressing buttons until she found the comm.“Watch it!”She ignored Han and radioed in, “This is Leia Naberrie coming in on the Millennium Falcon Corellian light freighter.”“Naberrie?” someone shouted in reply, a sudden wave of static coming over the comm.Leia held out her hand for Han to stop and nearly bit off a remark, but the static paused and a wave of background noise echoed throughout the cockpit.“You have permission to land. Welcome back, Naberrie.”A wave of comfort fluttered off of Luke, but Leia only felt closer to breaking down.The unfamiliar ship landed in a sea of starfighters and rebel ships. Many of the fleets and cells were still scattered throughout the galaxy, but Leia had a feeling that could come to an end soon.Luke sighed sadly at the sight of the starfighters, “The jawas took my ship for spare parts.”“Why would you let them do that?” Leia asked glumly, unable to mock him the way she’d sworn she would when the foolish purchase inevitably fell apart.“I was a bit urgent.”Han laughed, “You’re not getting that money back.”“Yeah, yeah, I know.”Threepio was the first one through the lounge and down the ramp, shouting about how happy he was to be back. Leia shrugged him off, keeping Artoo close.She was about to head into the base, but she saw an achingly familiar ship settled toward the edge of the base. Beside it was a stolen Imperial shuttle.Leia sensed Ahsoka before she saw her. She turned to the Temple and spotted the togrutan woman walking out of the structure, ignoring everyone in her way. Beside Leia, Luke brightened.Within moments, outside of the secret rebel base, Ahsoka had an arm around both Luke and Leia. Leia leaned into her immediately, burying her face in her shoulder as if there were tears to hide. For this short moment, before they handed over the plans and the galaxy began to burn, Leia wanted to hold onto Ahsoka like she was still a child.Ahsoka pulled back quicker than either of them would have, keeping a hand on each of their shoulders. Leia was thankful that they were in a somewhat secluded part of the base.“Are you both okay?”Luke nodded, and Leia pursed her lips. Her nod was must more hesitant; lying would have been easy, but Ahsoka would see through it anyway. She didn’t feel alive enough to give a believable performance for someone who would immediately doubt it.“Are you okay?” Leia asked. “Vader-““I didn’t fight Vader.”“What?” Luke voiced both his and Leia’s thoughts.Ahsoka took her hands off their shoulders and raised her posture, making her seem even taller than them. The dread within Leia only doubled. She looked around cautiously, and Leia caught sight of Rex standing by the Sky Walker. They hadn’t seen him or the ship they called home in far too long. At Ahsoka’s gaze, he headed into the ship.“He was more focused on other things, from what I could tell,” Ahsoka said tersely.“Than to fight you?”The dread tripled.Luke suddenly looked down, but Leia kept her eyes in front of her and saw what Ahsoka now had in her hand. Luke bringing Obi-Wan’s lightsaber had saved them all.“He saw this as you were getting away,” there was worry visible in Ahsoka’s tone, and it was horrifying.Luke’s jaw was hanging open, and Leia was just as speechless. They’d been a very well-kept secret for their entire lives, but this had always been inevitable. Leia understood the gravity in Ahsoka’s tone, but she couldn’t help but think that it tied back to the truth about Vader that they didn't know. There was no… reassurance or plan from her yet, and it was odd.“Didn’t we…” Leia nearly whispered, “always know this would happen eventually?”And, they had. It was why Ahsoka had taught them how to shield their abilities in the force as well as she had. So many of their lessons had been in preparation for the day, if they chose, that they publicly used their abilities against the Empire or anyone else. Many of those lessons had started after Ahsoka's fateful fight with Vader.Ahsoka turned her head to Leia, “Did he find out anything else? Did either of you use the force, or… by other means.”“I don’t think so, but I can’t be sure.”A sliver of the tension in Ahsoka slipped away, “You’d have known if he did. Vader saw Luke with Obi-Wan’s saber, and with your friend shouting about how you’re siblings, he may have already put the pieces together. Him choosing to pursue you two instead of me is… the worst case scenario.”“How would he know whose lightsaber it was?” Luke asked.Leia’s gaze flicked back to Ahsoka’s eyes. This had to be about Vader, too, just like everything else always seemed to be.It was also about them being in danger, she knew, but Vader had a part in it.“It’s Vader. He’s the Jedi killer. Believe me, he’s more thorough than he seems.”“No…” Leia said, the word slipping out before she could stop it.Ahsoka raised her brow bones, but Leia didn’t say anything else. She didn’t want to start an argument, not with everything that had just happened. She wanted to lie down.“We need to get the plans to command,” Leia said, raising her tone and finding that it was still hoarse.“Took you long enough,” Han said from behind them, strutting down with Chewbacca, Threepio, and Artoo. It seemed their droids had made some new friends. “You’d better have my reward somewhere ‘round here.”Leia felt Ahsoka’s eyes on her, “You’ll get your reward. Have patience.”“I better!” he looked at the three of them and stopped his gaze at Ahsoka. “So, you’re their mom? You coulda just said that.”All three of them collectively straightened, seemingly proving Han’s point of their relationship. Ahsoka wasn’t formally their mom, not with Padmé Amidala a known figure in their history, but it wasn’t as if they called Padmé mom, either.“We need to get to command,” Ahsoka said, turning.Artoo was at her side in seconds.Leia still felt like she was going to crack at any moment, but that wasn’t important. Vader knew that the two children of Ahsoka Tano were possibly force-sensitive and knew how to use a lightsaber, and somehow, it wasn’t even their greatest concern.The Death Star was still out there, and it had to be destroyed. There’d been enough fuss to get the plans and bring them back, and now, it was time.

Chapter Text
For as long as he could remember, Luke had loved flying.He’d grown up in a ship with the sight of hyperspace his visual lullaby. He remembered the first time Ahsoka had gotten in a dicey space battle, and how he’d watched in awe as she steered them away from the danger while shooting back at the opponentsHe hadn’t understood the loss of life and risk that came with it, then. Even when he did begin to understand it, his love for flying didn’t diminish. He’d been stealing the controls from Ahsoka since he was seven, and she’d taught him with caution; Luke piloted without caution, usually.When Luke was ten he’d been with Rex, walking along the sandy streets of Tatooine. It was Luke’s third time there, and this time, Rex had visited.Luke had grown to enjoy Tatooine. He’d adapted to the garish living conditions and learned how to farm with Uncle Owen. He adored spending time with his only living biological family— his mother had family on Naboo, but it was too risky to meet them— despite their lack of true knowledge about his parents. They had few stories to tell, but Luke loved them for more than their stories.Despite his developed liking for Tatooine, Luke still enjoyed the skies far more. He’d been walking with Rex, pointing out the type of each ship that came through. Rex had asked how his piloting skills were developing and promised to teach him some of the clone’s tricks some time.Then, Rex had chuckled and said Luke was just like his father.Ahsoka had never commented on Anakin Skywalker’s apparent love of flying, nor his impassable talent. Upon realizing his cluelessness, Rex told him several stories of Luke’s father's most incredible feats in the air.Luke was accustomed to being compared to his mother, and that was a fact he held dear to his heart, but learning that he shared his love of flying with his father only made him love flying more. Perhaps one day he could match his father's skill, too.Now, sitting in rebel command after handing over the plans to the Death Star, Luke’s leg bounced as he knew the flight of his life was coming up. This was the battle for the sake of the galaxy, to keep more planets from befalling Alderaan, Jedha, and Scarif’s fate, and he got to be a part of it.It wasn’t that he was happy anyone had to fight against a planet killer and the Empire itself. Yet, if it had to happen, he wanted to be on the front lines. Being able to be flying in the front lines was simply an extra benefit that he looked forward to.Toward the front of the crowded room was Ahsoka, her hands clasped behind her back. She was staring at the displayed plans, nodding along to General Dodanna. Rex was behind her, doing the same. There were no ground troops for this fight, and Rex didn’t fly, but Luke knew him well enough to know he’d always be there for the briefing. If Dodanna wasn’t as seasoned a general as he was, Rex would probably be giving him pointers.Leia was further back than Luke, considering that she was merely there to see the plan. She wasn’t going to be piloting, so she stood with the other members of high command. She didn’t have an official title, but she’d acted as a Fulcrum agent several times and was on the same level as every other politician or former politician that they had in the room, even if it had never been safe enough for her to really become a politician.Luke recalled the news that had come in only hours before he’d heard Leia was captured; the Senate was devolved. It wasn't as if they actually had any power, but the facade of a galactic republic was gone and war would begin soon.He focused on the plans and the orders given to the pilots. He felt Wedge nodding beside him and saw Biggs nudging other pilots’ shoulders when the speech fell toward them.It was going to be difficult. It was a one-in-a-million shot into the reactor, but once they made it, the whole thing would be gone.A single one-in-a-million shot would take out the entire Death Star. Luke thought back to his own piloting skills, and naturally, the precision that the force gave him. There was a reason he knew where to aim before the targeting system told him.They could do this.He could do this.Before long the briefing ended and the base moved into action. The starfighters were pulled out of the hangars and fuel lines were detached. Astromechs were being lowered into ships at every corner, and a whole lot more orange uniforms were seen around the base.Luke didn’t have his personal fighter anymore, but it wasn’t as if rebellion pilots ever had designated ships anyway; they suffered too many losses for that. Ships got traded around frequently, so there was a spare one for him.When he walked back into the main command room, he found Leia and Ahsoka beside each other. Leia looked as resilient as ever, but Luke wasn’t sure how she was still standing.He held out a gold and silver lightsaber hilt to them both, unsure who’d take it. There was no point in bringing it in the air.Ahsoka’s face softened out of her battle-hardened expression as she turned around. Leia, however, was the one to grab the lightsaber.“You’re taking this back when you return,” Leia said.Luke knew that she had even more questions about the Vader situation. He had questions, too, especially about how Vader would recognize Obi-Wan’s lightsaber so quickly, but it didn’t drive him crazy the way it did Leia. As soon as Ahsoka said Vader saw it, Luke had known Leia had questions she was dying to ask. This merely confirmed it.Unfortunately, Ahsoka wasn’t exactly privy to answering anything about Vader. It was one of the only things she refused to speak about.“Maybe I could make my own, instead,” he said, rocking back and forth on his heels as he sent a questioning glance to Ahsoka.Even Leia’s eyebrows shot up.“It’ll still be hard to find a crystal. What’s the rush?” Ahsoka asked gently, not asking him to change his mind but giving a rational question.“Just… with Vader knowing about us, and all, maybe I could start actually training? Like… Jedi training?”Leia tensed, but Luke wasn’t sure why. He’d admitted to her multiple times that he wanted to train to be a Jedi eventually.Ahsoka smiled, “That can happen. We’ll talk about it when you come home safely. Be careful out there, Luke. Don’t get ahead of yourself.”“I would never,” he smiled, but at the serious tilt of her head, he nodded. “I promise, I’ll be careful. And I’ll come home.He looked at Leia, who reminded him of cracked glass, ready to shatter at any moment. He hoped someone kind was there when it happened.“Han is joining you, apparently,” she said, likely sensing his thoughts' direction. “Hopefully he’s as capable as he thinks he is.”“Really? That’s great! Do you think he’ll actually join up?”Ahsoka crossed her arms, “From what I could tell, he has no idea why he’s even going. But, I wasn’t part of the conversation.”“I knew you were listening,” Leia turned to Ahsoka, the hint of a smile showing on her tired face. “I’m not sure if his possible joining is a good thing or not, but I wish you both the best of luck up there. If he gets in your way, maybe shoot him out of the sky.”“Leia,” Ahsoka said sharply. Leia merely shrugged.“I’ll try not to. Thanks, both of you. I’ll see you soon. Love you.”“You too,” Leia said. “May the force be with you, Luke.”“Be careful,” Ahsoka reiterated.He nodded, and then he was off. Sure enough, the Millennium Falcon was among the other rebel ships, and the fact almost excited Luke. After a brief exchange with Biggs and Wedge, Luke found himself pausing before he headed to his new x-wing.“Didn’t think you’d be staying long!” he shouted to where Han was pulling out fuel lines.Chewbacca said something, and Luke made a mental note to learn shyriiwook sometime.“Me neither! I’m here to make sure all those bastards who tagged my ship aren’t gonna do it again.”Han was the average pirate, Luke supposed. He was more in it for himself than he was for the galaxy. Still, he didn’t exactly believe Han’s excuse. No one was so willing to join what Han might’ve called a suicidal battle just for the sake of their ship being tagged.“I wouldn’t expect anything less,” Luke wasn’t sure why, but he grinned. “Good luck out there! Have our backs when we’re in the trenches.”“I’ll try,” Han bit off, a somewhat nervous feeling about him.Luke raised an arm and ran off to his own ship, finding Artoo already being lowered into it. The atmosphere before a large battle was always tinged with nervousness, but there was also a strange excitement, and Luke could feel it. He smiled as he hopped into the small seat of his ship and started up the engines.“This is Red 5, checking in,” he said, testing his comm into the main channel.A dozen others were doing the same thing.“Red 3, here. Ain’t this just like Beggar’s Canyon on Tatooine, 5?” Biggs said.Luke laughed, “Maybe we could get something easier for a change!”“If you’re here for an easy fight, you’d better give a better pilot your seat! Red 2 is here!” Wedge yelled, a smile visible in his tone.Luke grinned as the ships around him began to take off. He waited until the path was clear, but they were moving fast. He lifted off with the rest of Red Squadron with the knowledge that many of them wouldn’t make it out of this-- if any. They’d go out fighting and quick, at the very least.Luke steeled himself as he saw the sight of the planet killer up ahead, floating in space and looking as harmless as a moon. A chill ran over him.For the most important battle of the galaxy, it started just like any other. They all stood by until their orders were given, and just like they all had many times before, they jumped into battle.It was immediate chaos.The Death Star’s minor turrets certainly weren’t those of a star destroyer, especially when they were in ships small enough to weave around them. Getting so close to the surface made it look even bigger, and Luke had already been in the damn thing. While the pilots were usually accustomed to the formation of blockades and outer defenses of star destroyers, this was foreign.If he didn't hear his friends and fellow pilots dying, Luke might have been excited for the new experience.Luke heard Porkins go down, and for the first time, doubt crept in.“Luke, trust your feelings.”If Luke hadn’t been weaving around turret fire, he might have looked around the small cockpit for where the voice had come from.“Huh?” he said aloud as he blasted a turret, but the voice didn’t respond.Luke couldn’t dwell on it as TIEs showed up. He listened as fighters in red squadron went down, and he felt fighters from the other squadrons go down.They made it into the trench, but three TIEs went with them.One of them…Time was ticking until Yavin would be destroyed, so Luke steadied himself. He did well until he caught sight of the three TIEs following them and destroying his fellow pilots.One of them had a unique design, and Luke could sense strong darkness from within it. Quickly, he realized that the feeling was mutual. He’d also been sensed.It was clear when the unique TIE turned his targets onto Biggs, instead of either of them, and Luke knew that Ahsoka was right. He felt Biggs go out as much as he saw it on his scopes.Quickly, Luke switched his comm to reach the base, “Vader’s here! In a TIE!”It was purely meant for Leia and Ahsoka. The other rebels might take it as a breach of protocol, but he felt that it was more urgent to tell his family. He didn’t dare leave the trench, but as the solo fighter remaining, he felt boxed in. Luke looked into his computer, but he wasn’t sure how much he could do.“Don’t let fear distract you,” the mysterious voice said again. “Use the force, Luke.”Luke looked into his targeting computer and out the viewport rapidly.“Trust me. Let go.”Luke could have refused or questioned the mysterious voice, but instead, he put away the scanner. He could feel Vader behind him, but he let it all fall away as he focused on his instincts.One of the TIEs nearly got him, but the Millennium Falcon swooped in first. Luke smiled to himself, but he didn’t let himself get distracted.He fired, and the shot went in.Luke pulled up hard enough to slam himself into the seat, pulling on the engines to go as fast as he could. Three seconds passed, and for a short moment, he thought he blew it.The Death Star exploded.Usually, Luke cheered after a great victory, but he simply relaxed into his seat and readjusted his steering for Yavin.They’d done it.What had happened to Alderaan, Jedha, and Scarif would never happen again.He still sensed Vader, but for now, they’d won. A surreal wave of victory passed over him as Han congratulated him. Scarif had been a huge win for the rebellion even as they’d lost half the fleet that went, but this was even bigger. They’d just destroyed a huge space station that the Empire had been pouring funds into for years, and no matter how much the Empire tried to cover it up, people would learn.They’d lost people. Biggs was gone. Others were gone. It wasn’t the drastic, major loss of every battle they’d ever had, though. For the first time, the Empire had lost more than the rebellion, and it meant that the war had officially begun.Luke landed his starship with the others, already spotting Leia waiting for him across the hangar. Suddenly, Luke’s surreal relief rose to the same elation that everyone around him had, and he was hugging Leia and Han in a hangar full of cheers.“Am I missing something?”Ahsoka looked up from where she’d been staring out of the viewport of the Sky Walker. She'd grown to dislike her ship's name, but it wasn't as if she could change it.“They’re kids. I’m letting them celebrate. We have to evacuate soon, but they can have fun doing it.”Rex leaned off of the wall and walked over, slowly sitting in the copilot’s seat. They were both getting old, but he was the one who aged twice as fast.“Why wouldn’t they have fun with you there?” Rex asked, and Ahsoka could only sigh as she thought up a response. “Why aren’t you happy?”“I could ask you the same thing, you know. I am happy. The Empire will never destroy another planet like Alderaan or Jedha or Scarif, and this is a big win for us.”He raised his eyebrows, “Why do you look like the twins just went away even though they’re right outside, then?”Ahsoka’s lips quirked up before she could stop them at the analogy. He wasn’t wrong, she supposed.“Vader knows about them. Luke, at least. Probably Leia too.”Rex didn’t know Vader’s history, but he did know that Ahsoka knew it and had chosen to keep it concealed. He’d pushed, but her refusal to tell him was enough for him to stop asking eventually. She didn’t like lying to him, but she didn’t want to see his reaction that the General whom he still looked up to was the same man who helped destroy the galaxy. Rex didn’t deserve that.Ahsoka continued, “He saw Luke with Obi-Wan’s lightsaber, so it’s not even like he’s a random Jedi survivor or Padawan trained by a survivor. He knows Luke and Leia are connected to me, along with Obi-Wan.”Unlike Leia— and Luke, when he wanted to— Rex didn’t push to find out everything about Vader. Ahsoka sometimes wondered if he already knew, somehow. She realistically knew that he didn’t, but Rex was no fool.“You trained them for this.”“Not well enough. He’s a Sith Lord,” she met Rex’s eyes. “Luke wants to train as a Jedi.”“Hasn’t he always?”“He wants to train as a Jedi now. He told Leia and I before going up there. I think it’s because I told them Vader knew about them. I just don’t want him to rush if it’s not what he’s ready for, or if he doesn’t want to.”Seeing her guilt laid out before them, Rex sat up with a sigh. He was essentially a glorified babysitter for the twins, but he was also her closest friend.“It’s Luke. If he told you, I’d bet he wants to. Was Anakin any different?”For Rex’s sake, Ahsoka forced a small smile onto her face. It was difficult to lie to him, but she knew how to when it truly counted.“They’re similar in the way that they’ll both do something if it means they can help people before they question if they really want it,"" talking about Anakin while knowing what he’d become was nauseating.“And Yoda would tell him that, right? I know we’ve got our problems with the Jedi, but he wouldn’t lead Luke down the wrong path, do you think?”“No. He wouldn’t,” Ahsoka was assured of that fact, considering that Yoda knew how it had hurt Anakin. He’d be careful. “You’re right.”Rex smiled, “I do that, sometimes, you know. Are you sad to see him go again?”“Not as sad as I am worried about what he’ll do once he’s trained. I don’t want him thinking he can fight the whole Empire himself.”“Well, he wouldn’t think he could fight them all himself. Leia would be with him, of course, Jedi-trained or not.”Ahsoka’s genuine smile returned, “That’s not a comforting fact.”Before the conversation could delve any deeper, there was a crash and a pair of loud voices from the corridor. Ahsoka slowly turned to look down the hall. She couldn’t see the twins yet, but they’d arrived.“Did they have drinks out there?” Rex asked.“They’re supposed to be packing up the base before the Empire gets here any moment now, so they better not.”Unfortunately, as Ahsoka watched Leia storm into the lounge with a crate, she recalled that this wasn’t a joyous victory. Alderaan had still been destroyed. Leia had still been through Imperial torture. Vader still knew about the twins.Unlike usual, the voices down the hall weren’t laughing. They weren’t even the normal sibling bickering that drove Ahsoka mad. Both kids were exhausted and worn through, and one of them was going to break soon enough whether she expected it or not. It was how these things went.Leia saw Ahsoka watching her, “We’re about fifty percent done. I don’t think we’ll be able to get above sixty percent of the things on the base, but they aren’t worth the extra time it’ll take.”Ahsoka did help, originally. The cargo hold was packed with every crate she could find.She nodded, “This is the best possible way to leave a base, so I’ll take it.”Luke walked into the lounge behind Leia, pushing two crates stacked atop each other with a dozen things in his arms. He’d overpacked them, it seemed.“We also loaded a bunch onto the Falcon. Han’s coming with, I guess.”Leia rolled her eyes, but Ahsoka had seen the way the three of them had been celebrating. Ahsoka cast Rex a smile.Luke was the first one into the cockpit as Leia attempted to organize the crates stuffed into the lounge.“Hi,” he said happily to Rex, falling into the seat behind him.“Hey kiddo. Good job up there.”Luke smiled, lightly shaking his head, “Thanks. I did just as much as everyone else.”He could modestly deny it all he wanted— he was so much like his mother— but he’d been the last fighter in the trench and the one to deliver the final blow to the Death Star— so much like his father, too. It was undeniable.“You did good,” Rex patted his shoulder.Leia walked in and slowly sat behind Ahsoka. Ahsoka wondered how much pain she was in from the aftereffects of Imperial capture.“He’s hearing voices,” Leia said bluntly.Luke sat up, looking at her sharply. He opened his mouth as if he was going to yell at her, but he was smarter than that. Instead, he slouched back into his seat and looked at Ahsoka nervously.“What?” Ahsoka asked both of them. Rex looked far more amused than she felt.“Uh… yeah. During the battle. It… I don't think I’m losing my mind, okay? It felt peaceful. Calming. I think…”It wasn’t as if this was unheard of within the Jedi. Ahsoka knew well that nothing was impossible.What if it was somehow Sidious? Or even Vader, if he’d grown that powerful?“What did they say? Can you describe it at all?”“He knew my name. He was telling me to use the force and trust my instincts. When I put my computer away, when command yelled at me for that, he told me to use the force. And… to trust him. To let go.”Rex’s subtle cheeky smile only grew. There were few things more Jedi than what Luke was describing, but it was still possibly a trick. Ahsoka couldn’t rule anything out.“Can you describe the voice?”Leia was staring at Luke, and Ahsoka wondered if somehow, despite her lack of true knowledge of the force, if she had any of the same worries as Ahsoka.“It was… a core accent. Very core, actually. Coruscanti, even.”Rex’s smile finally broke into a laugh, “You’re kidding.”Ahsoka pursed her lips, but she knew exactly what he was thinking. She couldn’t process it. Coming back after death had to be impossible, yet… the Jedi believed that no one ever truly died. Why wouldn’t they be able to return?“What? Who is it?” Luke sat up eagerly.Rex looked at Ahsoka, waiting for her to say it.“I wonder if using his lightsaber somehow triggered this,” she said quietly, unwilling to fully consider it.It took a moment, but both of the twins’ eyes widened simultaneously.“I heard Master Obi-Wan?” Luke shouted.Leia’s jaw dropped, “How is that even possible?”Ahsoka held out her hand, “We could be wrong, but… based on what you said and the accent, there’s few Jedi I can think of who talked like that and had such a Coruscanti accent. Having his lightsaber almost makes it make sense. The Jedi always believed that no one truly dies, so even though I’ve never heard of this specifically, it’d make sense.”Luke stared at her with huge eyes momentarily, before he looked at Leia with the same expression. She sighed disbelievingly, but a small smile appeared on her face.“We shouldn’t even be surprised,” Leia said.Luke turned back to Ahsoka, “Well, what do I do if I hear him again? How can I respond?”“By speaking, I’d assume. If he’s… part of the force,” her forehead wrinkled in thought, “then he can probably sense how you feel, too. I’d say if you hear him again listen to him, but even Obi-Wan was wrong sometimes.”Rex chuckled beside her. She knew that he loved hearing about Jedi or force topics; it reminded him of the old days.“So…”“Trust your instincts. Obi-Wan wouldn’t lead you in the wrong direction, and he knows what he’s talking about, but don’t let him be your only sense of guidance.”“Of course not. You taught us better,” Luke looked at Leia, but her smile seemed less than real.“We’re all packed up. We can depart. You know the location, I assume?” Leia asked, sitting up promptly.Ahsoka nodded and looked at Rex, “You’re coming with us?”“If my room is still open.”“Who else would take it?” Luke said.Ahsoka motioned to Luke to prove that he was right. Rex laughed, “I guess I’m with you all.”They dispersed relatively quickly, after that. Luke and Rex jumped into a conversation about the previous battle, and Ahsoka set to entering the coordinates. Leia had asked if she knew where they were going, but she’d made the checkpoint herself years prior. It was in a secluded part of space away from any systems of major trade routes, and even the hyperspace lane was finicky at best.Luke moved his fighter to be docked on the Sky Walker after Rex reminded him. They’d connect to one of the larger ships once they got to the checkpoint— or they’d land in a hangar if they had room for an extra small freighter— but he needed to bring his own fighter. Ahsoka was curious as to what happened to the fighter he’d spent so much of his credits on.The rebellion didn’t have a central base anymore, and Ahsoka wasn’t sure how well that’d do for them. Leia sat with her as she took off amidst the squadrons of ships evacuating. It was only a matter of time before the Empire arrived, and they’d come in force. She hated to think of everything left behind for them to dig through.For a former Sith-built temple, the structures of Yavin were incredibly calming. Ahsoka was sad to see them fall into the Empire’s hands. Perhaps one day they could be restored for the Jedi.Leia tried to get up once they were safely tucked into hyperspace and on their way, but Ahsoka shut the cockpit doors before she could leave.Leia sighed in irritation. An old, traitorous voice in Ahsoka whispered that she was so much like Anakin, but she shut it down.“You need painkillers. You’re moving slowly.”“If you open the doors, I could get them,” she huffed, even as she fell back into the seat behind Ahsoka.She was still in her Alderaanian clothes, and Ahsoka wondered if she’d ever take them off. They were muddy and stained, and the bottom looked as if it had been put through a shredder. With the day she’d just had, it may have been. Leia pulled her legs up to her chest, propping the heels of her boots on the edge of the seat. She used to fall asleep like that when she was smaller.Ahsoka turned her chair to fully face Leia, “You’re not okay.”Leia leaned her ear against her shoulder, “Can we just wait until the rebellion gets situated?”Ahsoka didn’t think she was very good at the tough love thing, even for someone who was so battle-hardened. Rex was much better at it than her, but Rex wasn’t the primary caretaker of her kids. She wanted to give Leia a hug and tell her they could go huddle on the couch and watch holomovies until everything healed, but that wasn’t how things worked, and there was a rebellion out there. That didn’t mean that Leia could ignore what had just happened.“And then what?” she asked softly. “Then there’s a battle, and we have to wait, and then we’re swept apart again and we’re waiting until after. If you ignore it, then somewhere during all of this you’re going to break. It won’t be pretty. I’ve been through this, remember?”It wouldn’t have helped her, and it probably didn’t help Leia, but she wanted to offer support. Leia’s gaze was stuck on hyperspace outside.“Did you break?”Ahsoka didn’t waste a second before nodding, “Yeah. When I walked on this ship and set you and Luke down on the floor.”Leia looked at her sharply, her whole head turning. Ahsoka tried to give a small smile. The twins knew the broader details of the horrific events of her life— leaving the Temple, Order Sixty-Six, and some others— but never the specifics. They merely knew the historical facts, and Ahsoka didn’t burden herself with telling them more unless the situation called for it. Now, the situation called for it.“Then what’d you do?”“Try to make myself stop crying because you and Luke felt it and suddenly I had two wailing newborn humans in front of me,” Ahsoka cracked a smile.Leia’s smile was thin and frail, but Ahsoka savored it. She didn’t know how many of those she’d see after the recent events. For a moment, Ahsoka thought Leia was going to start crying as her smile faded and her cheeks paled, but it seemed that she decided this wasn’t the moment.“What am I supposed to do?”“Listen to your body. Pay attention to your emotions. Don’t stuff it all down; let it up sooner rather than later.”“When? There’s a war, now. There’s always been a war, but now it’s real.”Ahsoka set her hand on Leia’s like she had when she was little and crying over something. Back then, she’d never have guessed she’d want Leia to cry.“Honestly, I know it doesn’t seem like it, and everyone around us would disagree, but there’s more free time in war than you think. It’s strange, and it’s not always pretty or private, but it’s there. There’s so much waiting, and sometimes it’s horrific, but I’m sure that time will come soon, and you’ll be able to breathe again. The galaxy lies in wait now, and we wait with it.”Leia blinked at her for what felt like a long time. Down the hallway, Ahsoka heard Threepio talking about something being preposterous as Rex and Luke laughed. The blue of hyperspace illuminated the small cockpit.“Were you this wise when we were little?”Ahsoka laughed, “No clue. Don’t even ask me how I got here. Did you hear anything I just said?”Leia’s smile was still frail, but it was real, “I did. Thank you. Was that old Jedi wisdom or Ahsoka life experience wisdom?”Ahsoka looked up in thought, pursing her lips in a smile, “Maybe both? Maybe some Obi-Wan wisdom mixed in with Fulcrum wisdom. It sounds like something Obi-Wan would’ve said.”“Maybe you two could talk about it.”Ahsoka tried to keep her smile solid.“I don’t think he’ll be visiting me. It might just be awkward. He’s got better things to do.”Leia’s smile lessened, “Do you think any ghosts would visit me?”“If you need them.”Her lips tugged downward.“I feel like all-knowing ghosts would be nice right now.”Ahsoka squeezed her hand, “You don’t need ghosts if the living are around to provide you more comfort than the dead could.”Leia nodded, but it was clear that she wasn’t entirely convinced. Luke had always been gifted with the force, but Leia was slower to latch onto it. She could beat Luke in a saber fight or out-debate him for hours, but somehow, the force always seemed to matter more.“You wanna go join them?” Ahsoka asked.“I want to sleep.”One of Leia’s buns was falling down, and Ahsoka smiled at it.“Want me to fix your hair first?”“I’m not a child.”“I could do the sleeping braids. You know the one on the top of your weird flat head, and then the others hanging down so you can still lay flat.”Ahsoka thanked every force that existed for the upturn of Leia’s lips. Figuring out hair was a struggle— especially when it needed a trim— but by the time Leia was five they had three hairstyles that Ahsoka was relatively sure Padmé used to wear. She certainly didn't do them as accurately as Padmé, but she’d wanted to give Leia some of the luxuries that her mother had. On Alderaan, she learned how to do her own hair much more elegantly, but it was a memory that Ahsoka held onto.With a huff, Leia spun around in her chair. She let one of her legs hang above the ground, kicking it back and forth. Ahsoka wondered when the next time they’d have a moment like this would be.With only little trouble, she pulled out Leia’s fragile buns. There were pins and hair ties in every direction from when Leia had frantically fixed them throughout the day. Leia complained more than a few times out Ahsoka pulling her hair, but she wasn’t frowning anymore.Ahsoka wrinkled her forehead as she braided Leia’s hair into sections, tying the upper ones into a circle that reminded her of one of Padmé’s headpieces. Headpieces would’ve been easier for Ahsoka to handle, but they wouldn’t fit most of their disguises. Besides, they seemed painful. She let the other braids hang low in two strands, where they wouldn’t bother Leia and would give her as peaceful sleep as possible.Leia spun back around and touched the top of her head delicately once Ahsoka was finished. It never looked perfect, but it was one of Ahsoka’s finer hairstyles. Ahsoka brushed down some of Leia’s smaller hairs, letting her hand remain on the side of her head momentarily.“Don’t hold everything in. It’ll only be worse later. No matter what’s happening, I’ll make time for you with all that has just happened. I always will.”Leia looked far too old for her age.“I know. Thank you.”“Goodnight, Leia.”“Night,” she stood. “Love you.”“You too.”It was dangerous for a force user to love, and it was against everything Ahsoka had been raised on, but it was one of the small pleasures she had in life; to simply admit something so strong. Ahsoka wished that the twins wouldn’t claim it so casually, not with the risk that came with it, but she wouldn’t deny what was true. She loved those kids.

Chapter Text
It took four months for the rebellion to reorganize to a level of equivalence to how they’d been on Yavin. They took stock of what they had and didn’t have even while fighting in constant battles. The battles weren’t simply for the sake of relief or recruiting more people anymore; they were for the sake of winning the Galactic Civil War.Leia had been named a Commander and often found herself in a control room, watching with bated breaths as pilots and ships went off the scopes and battles were won or lost. She gave advice and battle strategies, slowly getting a proper grasp on wartime.Luke left three days ago.She didn’t know where he went; she wasn’t privy to that information. It wasn’t safe. Luke and Leia had always been somewhat aware of someone hiding out there to train them as Jedi if they wanted, but that was as much as Leia had ever known. She didn’t even think Luke knew the name of the grand Jedi survivor he was trying to find.“And usually you’re the one telling me to pay attention.”Leia wasn’t sure if she’d ever met anyone more infuriating than Han Solo. She wasn’t sure why he was still sticking around, but his piloting skills were good for the rebellion, so it wasn’t as if she could tell him to leave. Right now, it was damn tempting.She swiveled toward him, the briefing around them not relevant to her, anyway, as she opened her mouth to give a retort.“Leia,” a familiar sharp voice cut through the air. “Mon Mothma requested to speak to you about the files you recovered.”Leia’s grimace only grew as she and Han both turned toward Ahsoka, standing only meters from them. Her hands were behind her back and her chin was high, her brows raised expectedly. She looked between the two of them three times, and Leia didn’t like the small smile beneath her formalities.“Guess your mom is calling,” Han said, and Leia wanted to punch the grin off of his face.She didn’t give him the luxury of a response and walked over to Ahsoka, holding her datapad close to her side.Once Han wasn’t in earshot she said, “Since when were you a messenger?”“I’m not, but I was with Mon when she said she needed you, so I volunteered. How are you?”Leia knew that was why she was here. It wasn’t as if she didn’t see Ahsoka frequently in the halls, but it wasn’t often that they got a moment to speak. Ahsoka still managed to ask how she was doing a dozen times a week.“Fine,” she said tersely.“How have you been sleeping?”Leia was accustomed to knowing that Ahsoka knew everything, but it still irked her. She was sleeping horribly— she preferred not to, considering the nightmares— but Ahsoka didn’t need to know that. She was busy enough.“Fine.”Ahsoka conveniently stopped walking as they reached an empty part of the hall, “Leia. What did I tell you?”“I know what you told me, and I’m fine. Does it look like I’m falling apart? You’re treating me like I am.”“You’re angry.”Ahsoka didn’t need to continue to tell her how dangerous that could be for a force-sensitive person. It wasn’t as if Leia was particularly gifted in the force in the first place, though, so she wasn’t particularly worried.“I’m fine,” she tried to walk past her, but Ahsoka stepped in front of her.Ahsoka was sad, “You can’t ignore this, Leia.”Leia wanted to scream at her. Just like Ahsoka thought, she wanted to scream and cry and fall to the ground. She wasn’t sure if she’d ever get up, though, and there wasn’t time for that. She had to be there for the rebellion.“Mon is waiting on me. You know how busy she is.”“You’d rather speak about recovered files from Bail Organa’s office than speak to me about this?”“At least one helps the rebellion. Isn’t that the priority?”“Every second you ignore your feelings you can help them less. But that’s not what’s important-““Is ignoring your feelings not what you did? I’d say you helped the rebellion a lot.”If Ahsoka had been about to say something else, her mouth snapped shut. Guilt pooled in Leia’s stomach, and she knew Ahsoka felt it, but she didn’t have the energy to apologize.“Do you want to have dinner together later? There’s no battle in this sector, so we should have the chance.”It was a nice prospect, but it’d only be filled with more of Ahsoka’s probing.“I have work to do. We can find another day.”Leia didn’t watch to see the look on Ahsoka’s face. Ahsoka was a spy, so she’d handle it. Leia trekked down the hallway, casting idle glances at the rebels around her.She went to the meeting with Mon. She spoke politely and kept the sob that seemed to be permanently lodged in her throat down and hidden, and when she walked out, she didn’t shed a tear. She went to her office, in desperate need of a break from everyone, and found Rex sitting across from her seat at the desk.Leia had been raised kind enough not to kick him out. She even managed a small smile, always happy to see Rex.“I didn’t expect to see you back for months,” Leia said as he turned to smile at her.She sat at her desk across from Rex and set her datapad into the drawer. She had more work to do than the galaxy had time for, but it could wait a few minutes. She took a sip of her caf.“I didn’t expect to be back for months, but the operation on Ibaar is finished.”“Finished?”Rex smiled, “Done. We have some troops still there, but most of the Imperials have pulled out.”Leia couldn’t remember the last time she’d heard such good news.“That’s incredible. Good job.”“Thanks. Not sure how many ground missions I’ve got left in me, but I’m happy to help where I can.”“You’re a huge help. Don’t strain yourself,” Leia wrinkled her forehead.Rex aged twice as quickly as everyone else. He was technically elderly, but for most of her life, Rex had been like any other adult. It felt weird talking to him in such a way.Her mind felt as if it was acting on autopilot, lately.Rex laughed, “I heard Luke finally went off to Yoda?”“Yoda?”Leia supposed that if any Jedi survivor would train them, it'd be the fabled Master Yoda.“Huh. I thought Ahsoka woulda spilled that truth since Luke just went there?”“She didn’t tell either of us. It’s part of the training, I think.”Leia smiled. Luke was walking into a whole lot more than they’d thought, based on what Leia knew about the Jedi Master.Rex chuckled, “Well, you’ve got a leg up now.”“Luke will tell me as soon as he gets back, anyway.”As if he was able to sense how tense she was, Rex sat up.“He’ll come back. It might take some time, but it won’t take forever.”“I know that,” her voice was much firmer than she intended, and she shook her head lightly in an attempt to tell him that. “I still don’t really agree with him leaving in the middle of… all of this.”Rex nodded in understanding, “That’s fair. He’s doing what he needs to do, and you’re doing what you need to.”It wasn’t as if they weren’t frequently apart, but this time felt different. They’d just been apart for months before everything happened and the war began, and now there was a real war, and they were apart again.“I know. How’s Ahsoka?”Unlike usual, she didn’t think before saying it. She mentally cursed herself and took a sip of her caf, needing it to kick in quicker.“She’s okay. As good as anyone, I’d say.”Leia nodded, tensing as she met his eyes, “I’m sure she told you about me.”“I’m not here to berate you. I agree with Ahsoka, but if you don’t bring it up, I won’t. I just wanted to say hi.”Leia needed a nap. Unfortunately, a nap would only plague her with nightmares, and she’d wake up feeling worse than before.“Sorry. I… things are a mess.”“I know. But, we’re at war, so I took the small chance I have to say hi.”“Ahsoka said there was a lot of free time in war,” Leia murmured, recalling the other part of that conversation.Rex chuckled, “Free time, sure, but not good free time. And that is only useful for us if you’re with the person you want to speak to, and trust me, you’re usually not.”“I’m not an expert quite yet, I suppose.”“Hopefully, you never will be.”She smiled, looking at the files scattered across her desk. She needed to clean, or Ahsoka would have her head for the mess.“So,” Rex’s grin grew into something much cheekier. “I heard about this new guy, Han Solo.”Leia’s gaze flicked up to him, but she shrugged.“I’m honestly surprised he’s still around. He’s just some hotshot pilot smuggler with a debt to Jabba the Hutt.”Rex nodded exaggeratedly, “He’s been under your command a lot, I’ve heard.”Leia narrowed her eyes, “No one else wants to have to control someone like that, so I get sacked with him.”“His friend, Chewbacca, seems nice too.”“What are you trying to say, Rex?” Leia straightened.He stuck his hands out in peace, “I’m just making an observation. Ahsoka noticed him first, really.”Leia had figured as much, considering that Rex had just gotten back. She bit her cheeks and prayed she wasn’t blushing.“Solo is more irritating than a bantha in a snowstorm,” she said slowly, over-pronouncing her words. “You and Ahsoka must at least notice that, too.”Rex smiled, a knowing wrinkle on his cheeks. It was the same smile Leia had seen a thousand times before.“You could convince the whole damn Imperial senate that you hate him with that speech.”Ah. So she’d just reminded him of her mother, then.Ahsoka was better at hiding it when Leia or Luke showed signs of their parents, but Rex always smiled the same way. Leia had begun to recognize it and pointed it out to Luke when they were teenagers. Ahsoka didn’t usually say anything, but Rex was much easier to figure out. Sometimes, Leia wondered if he lived in the past when he was with their small family.“You should go find Ahsoka,” she said softly. “I… well, I may have hurt her feelings since I denied eating dinner with her. If no one eats with her, she’ll just work forever.”Rex stood with a nod. Leia knew she was being callous and foolish, but there wasn’t time for her to have a breakdown that she wasn’t sure she’d recover from. It simply wasn't an option. She couldn’t stand Ahsoka’s smothering about her well-being, but that didn’t mean she wanted to hurt her.“I’ll tell her you say hi. Make sure to eat.”Leia smiled and watched as Rex walked out, flashing a characteristic smile her way as he did. He probably had another job to run off to soon.It was times like this that Leia wished she was still a kid being babysat by Rex. That had always been so much easier.Three days ago, after crashing in the foggy swamp of Dagobah, Luke had exclaimed:“You’re Yoda!”“Yoda? Hm? Who is this?”Three days passed, after that.Luke would have left or asked Ahsoka for guidance, but his ship sank and Artoo didn’t have enough signal to reach Ahsoka across the galaxy.Yoda still didn’t acknowledge who he obviously was. Luke almost doubted it.He hadn’t known whom he was going to Dagobah to see. Ahsoka had merely given Luke coordinates and the name of the system, and he’d gone without any other knowledge. That had felt like something a Jedi would do. To jump into the wild headfirst, led by a trusted mentor but trusting the force to guide him.He had no clue what he was doing.Yoda consistently told Luke that he was impatient, too rash, reckless, and a dozen other things. Luke wanted to believe that this was training, Yoda trying to teach these attitudes out of him, but he was beginning to doubt if this was even whom he thought.He’d heard stories of Yoda. He was incredibly old and powerful. He taught every Padawan, at one point or another, and Ahsoka trusted him enough to send Luke to train with him. He hadn’t known what he was going to see, but he’d recognized him immediately. Once, when her montrals were shorter and her lekku didn’t reach her waist, before her facial markings had stopped shifting to fit her face, Ahsoka had laughed as she told Luke and Leia about Yoda’s small appearance. It was the only basis Luke had for whom he was speaking to, but he was sure that he remembered correctly.He wasn’t so sure anymore.Luke tugged on the rope that he’d secured to a tree and to the ship. There were several other ropes, all tied to move in unison with each other. It was a complicated contraction. He’d been hoping to use the force to give him further strength as he tugged on the ropes, but he’d had little success in pulling his ship up.He pulled hard, but the ship only groaned. He had to get out of here somehow.“So desperate to leave, are you?”“I came here,” Luke tugged, “to be trained by a Jedi Master,” he tugged again. “If the Jedi Master isn’t here, then there’s a war out there and people that need me.”“Hmm,” Yoda shook his head. “So simple-minded.”Luke dropped the rope and ran a hand through his hair, resisting the urge to pull it out.“Yeah, well, sorry, but it’s hard to think about things other than my friends dying.”“That is your problem, then. See the galaxy as life and death, you do.”Luke wracked his mind for the few Jedi beliefs Ahsoka had passed on, but he couldn’t recall anything about life and death. Based on the voice of Obi-Wan that hadn’t visited him since the Battle of Yavin, the Jedi didn’t die in death. His friends fighting in the war weren’t all Jedi, though, and their lives meant something.“The galaxy’s at war, so, yes.”He sat firmly on the dirt as Yoda moved toward him. Unexpectedly, Yoda actually sat down beside him. From across the bog, Artoo beeped.“You’re not even a Jedi Master, are you?” Luke stared at the ground. “Just some guy living in a swamp that I’ve convinced myself survived the Purge.”Yoda chuckled, and Luke took it as a yes. He groaned into his hands.“Too old. Too impatient.”Luke sighed.“He’s stayed longer than I would have,” a third voice said.Luke jolted up and raised his head, looking around. The voice was the same one he’d heard during the Battle of Yavin, and that meant it was Obi-Wan Kenobi.Sure enough, next to Yoda, in a blue haze that Luke felt he had to blink at to fully see was a human man. He had a reddish beard and short, graying hair. He wore robes that Luke had only ever imagined, although there was a strange haze around his torso.“Ahsoka’s child, he is certainly,” Yoda hummed.“Ahsoka wouldn’t have stayed this long, either.”Luke looked with wide eyes from Obi-Wan to Yoda, “You are Yoda! You did know!”Both figures turned to look at him, and Luke suddenly felt as if he’d done something wrong.“Want to train to be a Jedi, you do?”“Yes! I came here to find you to do just that!”“More to being a Jedi than training, there is!”“I’m willing to do it all! I… I want to help people. I want to learn to use these abilities like my father and… and you, Obi-Wan! And all the others! So that I can help people.”The two Jedi Masters shared a look.Yoda clicked his tongue, “Raised by a Jedi, you were not. Need to learn if a Jedi or a light side force user you want to be. Know the difference you do not!”Luke couldn’t argue with that. He knew well that Ahsoka wasn’t a Jedi, but she’d also been raised by them. Many of her beliefs still aligned with theirs— or so he’d always thought. He didn’t know that there was such a sharp divide between a Jedi and a light side force user.“Then tell me! I truly want to learn.”“Oh? Tell you, I am supposed to? You want me to simply tell what Jedi learn over a lifetime, hm?”Luke leaned back again, wincing at his brashness. It wasn’t very becoming of a Jedi.Who was he kidding, all he seemed to know about Jedi was what he’d learned from stories.“Please, Master Yoda. I’d greatly appreciate it. I want to see the Jedi thrive one day again, and I want to bring light back to the galaxy.”Obi-Wan disappeared, but first, Luke saw a smile on his face. He wasn’t like what he’d expected him to look like.“Teach you I will. Patience you must have!”Luke didn’t realize it at the time, but his frantic questions were useless. Yoda had already begun to train him from the moment he’d landed. The first three days had been beyond frustrating, but he could almost see why Yoda had done it. Luke had stayed, and it was the most important test of his life.Or, Yoda had spent eighteen years alone in a swamp, and it had gotten to his mind. Luke wondered if Ahsoka ever went through an equivalence of the test Luke had just been put through by the Jedi.Just like that, Luke went from flying in the rebellion and counting crates for inventory to swinging across the swamp with Yoda on his back. As much as he did physical training, he also sat in Yoda’s hut with a bowl of his disgusting stew and listened to lectures on what the Jedi truly were.Ahsoka sprayed some antiseptic onto the wound and then applied a bacta patch one-handed, squeezing Luke’s hand with the other.It was simply a minor wound, but it still hurt him. It caught her off guard.They’d been on Bith. Ahsoka had been hoping to find old Republic military supplies from the Clone War, and they’d unexpectedly found a group of battle droids. She’d only taken Luke and Leia because she felt it was safer than leaving them alone on the ship, and Threepio had repeatedly been reminding her that they had to go outside eventually.It hadn’t been hard to find the old base. Ahsoka had been packing everything she could into crates and loading them on a speeder she’d managed to fire up while telling Luke and Leia about Anakin and Obi-Wan’s adventures in this base. She hadn’t been there, but she recalled some stories.Her eyes had left Leia for two seconds, and suddenly she heard the telltale roger, roger of a battle droid. She’d almost thought she was dreaming.Her immediate shout to get out of the way hadn’t been quick enough as the battle droids fired. One bolt hit the speeder's engine, and the other skimmed Luke’s leg. The others missed, and Ahsoka took out all six droids in the blink of an eye.Now, Ahsoka was sitting on the floor of the lounge with two weepy kids, a frantic Threepio, and far fewer supplies than she’d intended to get. She’d passed along the location to one of her rebel cells for them to get the supplies since she’d had to run out and tend to Luke’s wound.In reality, Ahsoka knew that they were incredibly lucky that the bolt had hardly skimmed Luke’s skin. She recalled her first time getting shot, and she’d gone into shock and tried to keep fighting. Luke was only eight.“I’m sorry,” Leia murmured for the umpteenth time.Luke merely sniffled.“It’s neither of your faults,” Ahsoka repeated. “We just have to be cautious about these things.”“How?” Luke murmured, leaning against her as she finished patching his leg.He didn’t move or straighten his leg despite being able to painlessly, and Ahsoka understood the sentiment.“Caution. Finding cover, ducking, running. If you keep moving then most people wouldn’t be able to shoot you.”The clones would, but the clones were decommissioned. Stormtroopers were nothing like them.Artoo rolled over and opened one of his hatches, revealing two candy bars. Ahsoka pointed at him, getting both of the twins to see the candy bars. Leia immediately grabbed both, handing one to Luke so he wouldn’t have to move.When the twins turned two, Ahsoka had practically demanded Bail for droids. Balancing the rebellion and twins at once was more difficult than she’d have expected, especially once they started walking and speaking. She’d promptly been delivered Artoo and Threepio— one of which she was much more excited to see than the other.“Thanks, Artooie,” Ahsoka said quietly. “Say thanks, both of you.”“Thanks,” they both said in unison, their voices slightly less dreary than before.“Can I walk?” Luke asked.“You can, but I can carry you for now if you want. After you sleep you’ll feel better.”“We were gonna play dejarik after homework, though,” Leia pouted.Ahsoka raised her brows at them. This was the most seriously either of them had ever been injured— Leia once shocked herself on a wire and Luke toppled crates onto himself, but those were different from blaster bolts— so she wasn’t sure how strictly she was supposed to play it.It was one of the biggest struggles of taking care of two kids that were not her own after she’d been raised in a Temple. When she had to decide between their well-being or their emotions, to comfort them or be strict.“Did you do your homework?” she asked with a smile, already knowing the answer.Leia bit her lip before looking upwards and falling against the couch, “Technically.”Against Ahsoka, Luke smiled. She resisted the urge to sigh in relief.“Now, when would you have had time to do that?” Ahsoka smiled.“We,” Leia dragged the word out, “did it yesterday. And the day before. You saw us.”It took everything in Ahsoka not to giggle. She knew well not to outwardly show her amusement when Leia tried to work her way around something, but it was difficult when she was so damn funny.“Oh, so I guess every time I tell you to do your homework you’ve already done it? Is that how it works?”“Yeah!”“No,” Ahsoka leaned over to her to smooth her hair, pulling her against Ahsoka in the same way Luke was. She smoothed both of their hair. “You can play dejarik tomorrow after you do your schoolwork. Neither of you has to do it today.”“Yes,” Luke hissed with a smile. He and Leia clapped.Ahsoka rolled her eyes. Luke had been supposed to go to Alderaan with Leia in a week, but Ahsoka wondered if they had to delay it. His wound was merely a scratch, and she knew that even she was overreacting, but one of the twins being touched by a blaster for the first time startled her. She wondered if she needed to start training them with blasters or sabers soon.In the corner of the room, Threepio said something about training to Artoo. Ahsoka pursed her lips. She didn’t exactly want to begin training eight-year-olds and continue the cycle of fighting in a war young, but she didn’t know how much of an option she had.She thought of the gold, silver, and black lightsaber that sat in a drawer beneath her bunk. The twins would inherit it before they ever got the chance to build their own— if they decided to. She liked to think that Obi-Wan would be proud of them.The twins bickered before her, and Ahsoka leaned her head against the wall. There’d probably be more blaster shots, with the galaxy the twins were being raised in. She simply hoped she’d be there for them when it happened.

Chapter Text
Before Luke left, he’d spent much of his free time sitting in Leia’s office. It was the only way he’d ever catch up on rebellion files, considering that if he didn’t huddle himself in the chair in the corner he’d be in the hangar messing around with the other pilots.Leia now eyed the empty chair, and then looked at where Han sat across from her. She’d told him a dozen times to get his feet off of her desk, but somehow, he kept putting them back up.At least he was quiet. Luke was hardly quiet. She'd be lying if she said she didn't miss his constant background rants, however.Leia mentally slapped herself and willed her eyes to focus on the documents before her. She pulled one up on the holoprojector, watching footage from Sullust of the Imperial occupation.“That’s not a good look,” Han said with a grin that made Leia want to slap him.“Get your feet off my desk.”“Oh, I’m sorry, am I distracting you, sweetheart?”Leia didn’t look at him, deciding to ignore him. Chewbacca was much better company than Han, but Chewbacca didn’t like her office. Leia would even take Threepio over Han.He had a soft spot, though. That much she could see. Otherwise, there was no reason he’d still be sticking around— especially with all of his debt to a Hutt.She holoprojected a scene of Imperial occupation on yet another planet, watching it with a frown. Han looked up at the sudden noise, his eyebrows furrowing.“What is it?” Leia asked.“The voice talking about Imperial occupation… where is that?”“Bespin, in a city called Cloud City.”Han finally took his feet off of her desk, sitting up.“I know a guy in Bespin.”Leia sighed, “I wish we could send aid, but we’re stretched too thin right now. They’re lucky to only just now get occupied, so we can only hope it won’t get worse until we get enough forces to send people there.”Han stared at the holo with furrowed brows as if it’d suddenly grow more clear.“They’re under occupation?”“It’s starting, yes. Only small waves of stormtroopers now, but that’s how it always starts. The main leaders are being kicked out of the capital, from what this holo says.”“Lando’s probably being kicked out…” he murmured.Han looked down with a scowl on his face. Leia watched with raised brows as he seemed to argue with himself, the facade he put on and the goodhearted man within him at odds.He looked up at her as the goodhearted man trumped the scoundrel, “I’ll go.”“There’s no one to go with you. You can’t go on an unsanctioned-““Then you come with. You can’t stay here forever, can you? Luke got out.”A million corrections to Han’s sentence appeared in her head. Luke didn’t get out, he went to train as a Jedi. She wasn't trapped in the rebellion, as he seemed to imply. None of her corrections were worth voicing.“I have work…” Leia looked at her desk.She didn’t have much, though. Reviewing files only did so much good when they didn’t have forces to send to them. She looked between the desk and Han and wondered if she'd regret this.“If we can get it approved.”Han laughed, splitting his face into a grin, “I’ll tell Chewie to fire up the Falcon!”""Not yet, first, we have to get it approved,” she walked around her desk and opened the door, walking out while looking back at Han.The door slid open, and Leia turned around to see a blur of blue and white as she nearly ran into someone. Ahsoka made a sound of surprise.“Ahsoka!” Leia said, pulling away from her and retreating back into her office. Han’s eyes were wide behind her.“Leia,” Ahsoka said calmly. “Sorry. In a rush?”“No, uh, I wanted to ask permission for a mission to provide relief. What were you coming here for?” she tried to smile, recalling the tenseness of their last conversation.Ahsoka was still visibly worried for Leia, but it didn’t seem to be her priority.“I’m being sent out, so I wanted to say bye before I head off for a bit. I was going to take the Sky Walker, if you don’t need it.”“Oh,” Leia recovered from her shock quickly. “Of course, take it. Where are you headed, if you can say?”Ahsoka glanced at Han, and Leia took the hint. He did too, thankfully.“I’ll go wait on the Falcon. Tell me if you get clearance, I’m going no matter what.”He shuffled past Ahsoka and Leia before hurrying down the hall. Leia let Ahsoka fully in and shut the door behind them, leaning against the wall.“Naboo,” Ahsoka said tensely.Leia leaned off of the wall in shock. Her heritage lay on Naboo, but it had always been off-limits. She wasn’t sure if Ahsoka had ever even been there, and if she had, it was certainly before the Empire. Leia even had the option to go there once as an Alderaanian student, but it hadn’t been deemed safe.“Why?” was the only word Leia could say.“I can’t say exactly. I’m following a possible lead about Sidious. My spies started it, but I’m going to investigate for myself. It might come up dry.”Leia felt a lump in her throat that she had a hard time willing down.“Be careful… We need you back here.”It was Leia’s way of keeping Ahsoka from prying into her emotional state while still telling her that Leia and Luke needed Ahsoka. No matter what she thought or how they treated her, she was their only living parent, and Leia couldn’t imagine walking through this galaxy without her.Naboo was a beautiful planet that Leia had longed to go to more times than she could count. Yet, suddenly, she’d never wanted her family to be so far from it before.“I will. You be careful, too, on this mission. Take care of yourself, please.”Leia nodded stiffly. She and Ahsoka stood like that for a moment, wondering if the other would say anything else. When no one did, Leia lunged forward and hugged Ahsoka.Oh, how nice it would’ve been to be a child again.Ahsoka hugged Leia the same way she always had, with her hands pressed onto Leia’s back and a hold so familiar it could only be described as home. Leia leaned her head on Ahsoka’s shoulder, and for a short moment, she thought she’d crack right there.She didn’t. She pulled away, instead.“Love you.”“You too,” Ahsoka turned to the doorway before looking back at Leia with a grin. “Good luck on your mission with that boy.”She was gone before Leia could defend herself.Leia bit her cheek for a moment before walking back out, Ahsoka already halfway down the hall.Getting to command wasn’t difficult, but it did take some time to get their attention. There were always battles going on; therefore, someone always had to observe something, and couldn't respond to Leia's every beck and call.Leia smiled as she walked to the Falcon with clearance to get to Bespin. She wondered if Ahsoka had said anything.The Falcon wasn’t very large compared to some of the other freighters they had in the hangars of their flagship, but it was huge compared to the several starfighters beside it in the hangar. Leia walked over and tossed a hand up at Chewie, who was working on something atop the Falcon. That ship always seemed to need something worked on.Chewie said something that Leia loosely registered as a greeting and a shout for Han. Her knowledge of shyriiwook was vague at best, but she’d been attempting to study the major terms and vowels— along with battle terms, since it had to be most of what Han and Chewie talked about.“Leia, would you like me to accompany you?” came a mechanic voice from behind Leia; she sighed deeply before turning around.“I thought you’d have gone with Ahsoka,” she told Threepio.Ahsoka never said it, but it was easy to see that the droids were largely to keep Luke and Leia safe. It seemed that hadn’t changed even though they were adults, and she doubted that leaving Threepio behind was accidental. Luke had Artoo to keep him from throwing himself headfirst into danger, and now, Ahsoka made sure Leia had Threepio. She sighed again.“I didn’t even know she was leaving. Oh, please, you can’t leave me here all alone!”“Han might try to take you apart, but you can come. I know Ahsoka told you to.”“Why, I have no idea what you could mean.”Leia walked up the ramp of the Falcon, tossing the bag she’d brought onto the game table. The ship was as messy as it ever was, and if Leia cared more, she’d clean it herself. For someone who loved the ship as much as he did, Han sure let it fall into ruins consistently.“Does it even have a hyperdrive,” she muttered to herself.“Why don’t you stay and find out?” Han snapped from behind her.“I don’t even know why I asked command to get this approved.”“Ah, sure you don’t, princess.”Leia wasn’t sure where he’d gotten any ideas of her being a princess from, but he’d latched onto the nickname early on. She shoved past him and into the cockpit, walking in just as something sparked.“Don’t mind that,” Han shouted from the lounge. “Just a blown fuse.”She murmured to herself for the second time, “A blown fuse on the ship I’m about to be stuck in.”She needed to stop talking to herself.Han barged back into the cockpit, “What is the golden one doing here?”“Ask Ahsoka. She’ll kill me if he doesn’t come. And, he’ll get anxious staying here with none of us around.”“Why, we can’t have that, can we?”Leia sat in what had become her designated seat in the Falcon and ignored Han, pulling out her datapad. She needed to figure out the exact situation on Bespin so she could know what they were walking into.She’d never been to Bespin; she’d hardly even heard of it. Han never mentioned having friends, but Leia was cautious about anyone who chose to be his friend. Someone being a leader on Bespin and friends with Han Solo felt like a mismatched combination, unless the organization on Bespin was a criminal one, of course.From what she gathered while Han and Chewie fixed up the ship enough to fly— she hoped that they’d never have to do that in a precarious situation— Bespin wasn’t associated with the Empire or the Mining Guild. They had a mining operation, so for them to somehow dodge the Empire’s eye and avoid being forced to join the corrupt Guild was surprising. It meant that it was either very small, or something very bad was going on.Based on the Empire suddenly appearing and their call for help, it was a small operation that managed to avoid Imperial attention until now. Still, Leia wondered about the legitimateness of Han’s friend.“Who is your friend?” she asked when he finally walked into the cockpit. She’d seen several names that would fit the position Han described, but she wanted to be sure.“Honestly, friend might be a nice way of putting it.”Chewie said something in agreement, and Leia picked up the sound of the shryiiwook word for credits.“Well that was a long time ago, I’m hoping he’s forgotten about that.”“About what?” Leia snapped. “What’s his name? Are we walking into two hostile situations?”“No, no. He won’t be hostile. His name’s Lando Calrissian, and if he’s running a place like this then either he’s really cleaned up since I knew him or…”“He’s running a giant scam.”“Pretty much,” Han directed them out of the hangar and into light space.“Lovely.”“Yeah, well, if he’s running a scam then it’s definitely more my speed of things, and I don’t think he’ll hate me enough to make me run into an Imperial confrontation. If it is legit, then it’s your grounds. Perfect fit,” he grinned.Leia stopped her lips from turning upward. Something about this damn pilot always had her smiling, but she didn’t need to give him validation.“Perhaps we could turn around so I could stay at-“ Threepio’s nervous voice cut off as the stars blurred into hyperspace.“You’re the one who wanted to come,” Han said, and Leia smiled.“So, can you tell me anything about Ahsoka, since you trained all the younglings?”Luke took a bite of his disgusting stew and was able to swallow it down. It was worse than ration packs or anything they had in the rebellion, but just like he had with ration packs, he was getting used to it.He was also getting used to Master Yoda.He was strange and old, and the eighteen years of exile may have made him somewhat kooky— or maybe he’d always been like that, but Ahsoka never mentioned that part— but he was still the wise Jedi Master that had always been described to Luke. He was difficult and his consistent teachings were exhausting, but Luke was appreciative.“Nosy, you are. Ahsoka tell you to ask this, she did?”Could he really blame Luke for being curious?“Well, no, but… I imagine she’s not the same way now she was as a Padawan or youngling. I’m just curious.”Yoda shook his head.“Focus too much on the past you do. Ahsoka too!”Luke paused in the bite he was about to take. Ahsoka had superiors in the rebellion, but no one ever treated her as such. How could they, after everything she’d done for the rebellion? Even when they were giving her orders it seemed that they were on the same level. Hearing Yoda speak of Ahsoka as if she was younger or less knowledgeable than him was jarring, but Luke couldn’t deny his words.“What do you mean? It was a better time, for you and Ahsoka especially. How can we fight the Empire without seeing the past mistakes?”Yoda chuckled the way he always did when Luke said something that he was about to correct.“Exist the past does. Ignore it we do not. However, dwell on it you should not. No past or future there is, only the force. What is important is now.”Luke opened his mouth, but there was nothing to argue about. He leaned his head against the wall and tried to think. Yoda was undoubtedly right, but it was a complicated concept. How was he supposed to learn from the past if he didn’t think about it?“So… we help people now. With the guidance of what we know of the past?”Yoda’s expression didn’t change, but Luke felt something akin to appraisal in the force. He couldn’t help but smile.“Good! Now, come, much training you have.”Luke looked down at the stew he’d hardly touched, “But we just paused!”Yoda ignored him and continued walking out of the hut. Luke reluctantly took a large bite of his stew and followed Yoda. His ship still remained in the bog, along with his failed rope contraction to pull it out. It may have worked, and Luke was admittedly curious if it would've if he’d continued trying, but he hadn’t touched it since Yoda admitted to his identity.Luke wasn’t sure if he was supposed to, but he found that he liked his Jedi training. He didn’t like all of the physical and mental strain, but he loved when one of Yoda’s points clicked and Luke saw the reason to it.Yoda had been right; Luke had always known he wasn’t raised by a Jedi, but somehow, he'd figured he knew more. He’d noticed multiple times when Yoda taught him a lesson that Ahsoka still silently followed, but she hadn’t passed on many Jedi lessons. She’d raised him and Leia, not trained them to be Jedi. There was a stark difference.He was beginning to think that he actually knew the difference between a Jedi and a light-side user, and he was almost confident that he wanted to be a Jedi.Luke understood wholeheartedly why Ahsoka wasn’t a Jedi. He only knew the vague story of why she’d left the Order, but she didn’t seem made to be a Jedi anyway. Perhaps it was because he hadn’t been alive to see her as a Jedi, but he couldn’t imagine it. In the kindest way, he didn’t think she’d be a very good Jedi.He wanted to be a good Jedi, though. The Order had been flawed, and even Yoda didn’t deny that, but that didn’t mean the Jedi themselves were too flawed to be reborn. Luke wanted to help people around the galaxy using abilities that his parents had passed onto him and talents Ahsoka and now Yoda gave him. Even after the rebellion, he wanted to help people. He wanted to see other Jedi thrive and do the same.When Luke looked up from his thoughts, he shuddered. His eyes were drawn to the dark expanse of trees that had haunted him since arriving on Dagobah. He knew it was alive with the dark side, and Yoda had steered clear of it. He didn’t know what it was.“Allured you are?”Luke looked at Yoda as if he’d been shocked, “Ah, sorry, I just suddenly felt it. Have you ever been in there?”Yoda hummed and looked at the haziness of the trees sadly. Luke watched him, feeling as if he was looking at something he shouldn’t have. Despite repeatedly thinking of it throughout his time on Dagobah, he recalled that Yoda had been through Order Sixty-Six and the rise of the Empire. He couldn’t imagine what he’d gone through in the haze of the dark side.“Go you want to?”“I don’t want to…”“Live by emotion a Jedi does not, but ignoring emotions leads down a bad, bad path. Go. You must.”Luke looked at him, ready to protest, but found that he had no words to say. Yoda was right, after all. He turned toward the haze and took a breath.Yoda thumped his cane, “Your weapons. You will not need.”Luke felt at his blaster and, more prominently, Obi-Wan’s lightsaber on his hip. He’d been training with it, too. He looked back at the haziness and felt fearful; what was he supposed to do without a weapon?Reluctantly yet knowingly, Luke took off his bandolier and set it atop Artoo, who let off several cautious beeps. He'd watched Ahsoka walk into battles without lightsabers multiple times, and he knew that the force was his biggest defense.Luke stepped into the mist.It looked just like any other part of the swamp, at first. The path felt tight and secluding, only made worse by the sudden chill of the dark side that rushed over him. He moved his hands to his elbows for warmth before straightening; he couldn’t fear it. Ahsoka had long taught him and Leia not to fall prey to their emotions— as Leia had noticed, she’d put much more emphasis into it after her fight with Vader— and to push them aside when they could be a risk. Yoda had only reiterated it. He couldn’t ignore them, but he could release them when the time didn't call for them.This situation shrouded in darkness couldn’t possibly require his emotions; it only felt dangerous.A sudden gust of wind rushed around Luke, whistling in his ears and obscuring his vision. He bent his knees and grounded himself, looking back to where Yoda’s hut was now out of his sight.Quiet, vicious voices sounded. Luke’s head snapped back ahead of him, and he saw two hazy figures. They were turned toward each other, weapons extended. He couldn’t see anything more than a haze for each one, but as the voices got louder, they got clearer.They weren’t holding just any lightsabers, Luke realized. The figure with her back to him had two bright white rays of light in her hand, and the bulky form across from her had a single red ray.Luke’s blood went as cold as the air around him felt. The voices became loud enough to recognize.“-You. Not this time,” Ahsoka’s voice said through a haze of wind and blurriness.“What?” Luke whispered, looking around.Somehow, he knew that he was seeing the past. He panicked for a moment that he was having a vision of Ahsoka fighting Vader now, but he had a strong feeling that this had already happened.“Then you will die.”Luke grasped instinctively for his own weapon, his hand hitting a metal hilt. He took it off of his belt and looked around, unsure what to do as Ahsoka charged at Vader.How was this possible?Why was he seeing this?Part of him whispered that he could watch the fight play out. He could learn and investigate and figure out what had truly happened at this fight to change Ahsoka the way it had; to take away stories of the Jedi and bring on extra alertness and training, and most significantly, her fear of Vader.Luke clasped the lightsaber hilt in his hand and stepped forward.Suddenly, Vader was before him. He looked around, but Ahsoka was gone, and he stood in her place. The haze felt stronger, and everything seemed to move in delay. Luke knew he was as awake as could be, but he felt like he was in a dream.He backed up, a sudden wave of fear crashing over him. Vader scared Ahsoka, so how was Luke supposed to stand across from him?Luke swallowed.He was a Jedi. He had his father’s blood in him and all of the will that Ahsoka had passed onto him. He’d spent months being trained by Yoda and a lifetime being taught to manage his emotions.He shoved his fear and sadness and perhaps even anger down, releasing it into the force and setting it aside to process later.Vader struck, and Luke blocked his red blade with the blue one in his own hand.There was a sense of phantom strength in Vader’s blade. He moved in the same rhythm  as the holo Luke had grown up watching of his father, and Luke could almost hear the counting in the back; one, two, three, four. Again.Luke kept his emotions down and blocked each strike rhythmically. Slowly, the unsureness in his hands faded away into strength on the hilt, and he began to take the offense. It was for the good of the galaxy.When Luke looked back at Vader’s face, he staggered back and lost his stance. Suddenly, instead of fighting Darth Vader and his ominous mask, Leia’s face was within the mask.Luke stared at her emotionless eyes and expression and watched as she raised the red lightsaber back up, attacking him.Was it a trick? He knew that it had to be, that Leia would never be in such a position, but he wasn’t sure he could raise the blue lightsaber against her.Wait— blue lightsaber? He’d left Obi-Wan’s lightsaber with Yoda.Luke blocked the red lightsaber, and it occurred to him all at once that his emotions were getting the best of him. Leia would never be in Vader’s suit, so it was a trick of the dark side.He struck back, and the rhythm of his father’s holo broke as their moves became too fast for Luke to hear the counting.This was Vader. Luke shoved his emotions down and into the force the same way he’d been taught, the same way he had to in order to fight the Empire. The dark side would trick him in unthinkable ways, including using those he loved against him.Luke blinked, and suddenly, Vader didn’t dodge the red lightsaber in Luke’s hand.Leia’s expressionless eyes went wide and pained, and Luke backed away as his suited sister fell. Before he could stop it, all of his emotions rushed back, and the haze of the dark side felt colder than before.Leia’s eyes were wide open on the ground.Dread grew in Luke’s gut. He’d done something wrong. He looked away before the sight could destroy him; panic was rising in his chest and air was getting harder to grasp as he imagined the image of his sister’s pained and then lifeless eyes. He staggered back in the direction of what he hoped was Yoda’s hut.That hadn’t been right.Luke emerged from the haze and saw the light in Yoda’s windows. The darkness vanished partially, but Luke still shuddered as he saw Leia’s eyes.He reached out instinctively to their bond. It wasn’t the light tap in the force to ensure she was alive, but he shut his eyes and took deep breaths and felt her life-force across the galaxy. After a moment, he felt her recognition and connection as they acknowledged each other even from so far away.It had merely been an illusion. She wasn't dead.Luke took a deep breath. When he opened his eyes, Yoda was sitting on a tree branch beside Artoo. There was a somewhat disapproving feeling emanating in the force, but his eyes were trained on Luke’s side.Luke reached to the metal hilt that he couldn’t recall bringing into the haze.When he removed it from his belt and looked at it, he saw that it wasn’t Obi-Wan’s at all. It was nothing like his. There were black grooves along the bottom half, but the rest was silver. At Yoda’s strong gaze, Luke ignited the weapon.A blue blade lit up the dim space in front of Luke, and a simultaneous wave of light and darkness came over him.“I did something wrong,” Luke said with heavy breaths, his eyes stuck on the blue blade.“Yes,” Yoda nodded. “Think in right and wrong you still do, that is the act of wrong.”Luke unlit the saber and lowered it, furrowing his eyes at Yoda, “I don’t understand. I… I tried to keep my emotions down, but instead I attacked Vader and then Leia. I listened to my training and didn’t fight with emotions and tried to think logically but instead I went too far. I thought I was doing what I was supposed to?”Yoda hummed and patted the space beside him. Luke walked over, glancing back at the haze behind him. Somehow, it felt worse than before he’d gone in. Luke patted Artoo as he sat between him and Yoda.“I attacked Vader. I tried to be emotionless. But, he turned into Leia, and I still tried to keep my emotions down to prioritize the situation and not use the dark side and I ended up attacking her because of it! I don’t understand.”“Simple the force is not. Have compassion a Jedi must to help anyone.”“But… Ahsoka taught us to control our emotions. The dark side-“Yoda clicked his tongue, “See it differently Ahsoka does. Wrong she is not, but release all emotions you should not. Be selflessly compassionate you must.”Luke ran his hand through his hair, his head hurting just from trying to process it.Before Luke could wrap his mind around it, he heard a metal swoosh. When he looked beside him, Yoda was holding the mysterious lightsaber.“Find this in the cave you did?”“Yeah… it just kinda appeared. Have you seen it?”“Hmm. Many times I have. Brought it with me I did!” Yoda hopped off of the branch, and for a moment, Luke thought he’d play dumb and change the subject to something ridiculous. He did that sometimes. Luke wasn’t entirely sure if it was an act or not, but it sure was frustrating; he was trying to be more patient, though.“Do you know whose it is?”Yoda turned to walk away with the lightsaber, but he stopped in his tracks. Artoo beeped about Ahsoka.“Built this lightsaber Anakin Skywalker did, after losing his first.”Luke looked at Yoda for a short moment before the fact hit him, and suddenly he was off of the branch, too. With wide eyes and an open jaw, Luke looked at the metal hilt.“My father’s? No way!” he wanted to take it back, but he knew better than that. Instead, he tried to calm himself down and think logically. “Wait, why doesn’t Ahsoka have it?”Yoda looked at the saber with carefully guarded emotions and a gaze Luke couldn’t place. Jedi survivors all seemed to share that look, Luke thought. Ahsoka got that way, too, if they were talking about the past.As Luke looked at the saber, he found that he vaguely recognized it. He recalled seeing the black grooves on his father’s lightsaber in the training holo Ahsoka used to let them use, but he’d never paid enough attention to truly see it. He recalled back to the vision-like haze of the dark side, and the way the lightsaber had turned red.“Too perceptive she is,” Yoda murmured, tossing Luke the lightsaber. “Be careful with that, hmm!”Luke caught the cold metal in his hand and sat beside Artoo. Yoda was off in moments, leaving Luke alone to his thoughts. Luke knew well that Artoo hadn’t been memory wiped and must’ve recognized the lightsaber immediately. He’d only ever projected one holo from the past before Ahsoka must’ve forbid him from doing it again, but it confirmed that he’d never been memory wiped.Luke smiled at the memory. He missed his family.“Hey, pal, can you show me that one holo?”Artoo had dozens of holos saved of their small family, even if Ahsoka didn’t want him to for safety reasons. Yet, there was one specific one that he’d once played when Luke and Leia were eight before being forbid from ever showing more from before they were born. Since they’d already seen it once, he always played it for them if they asked.Artoo gave the droid equivalent of a sigh.Regardless, a holo that had grown blurry with age projected in the swamps of Dagobah. Yoda would probably berate Luke for it, but he needed a taste of home, even if this wasn’t exactly his home. He could practically feel Leia beside him, taking in every detail of the holo that same way he did.A human woman with dark curly hair was illuminated in front of Luke. Her eyes were soft and her clothes regal, but her shoulders were relaxed and her lips upturned.“Rex and the boys offered to make you a gift,” a deeper voice said before the holo glitched and he appeared.Luke looked at both of his parents in all of their glory. Now, he could recognize his father’s lightsaber on the belt of his armored Jedi robes. His hair barely covered his ears and scratched his neck, but he looked as happy as Luke’s mom.“Ahsoka too,” Luke’s dad said again, moving closer to his mom.“What about me?” a vaguely familiar voice said.As always, Luke watched as his dad physically startled, his head turning sharply and his shoulders raising enough to glitch the holo as he jumped. Beside him, his mother also startled, but only because of his reaction.Ahsoka appeared in frame, but not the Ahsoka who Luke was accustomed to. She was much shorter, and her lekku and montrals were smaller than he could ever remember them being. There was a string of beads between two of her lekku and one unfamiliar lightsaber hilt on the side of her belt. She walked lighter than he was used to; Ahsoka was still agile, but something about it was more relaxed than he could ever recall.Luke’s mom and Ahsoka both burst into laughter at the sudden reaction of his dad.Luke smiled in the quiet of the bog, hearing Ahsoka’s young laughter and his mom’s unfamiliar giggles. His father blushed and started to defend himself, and then the holo was gone.That probably wasn’t something a Jedi was supposed to do, but Luke felt somewhat better. He glanced at the hut and found that Yoda wasn’t budging; it seemed their training for the day was finally done.Luke thought back to Yoda’s point about a Jedi needing selfless compassion. If he laid down to think about it, he’d end up falling asleep.“Thanks Artoo,” Luke said as he stood, walking over to the flattest ground he could find.In true rebellion fashion, Luke started doing pushups to calm his mind and process Yoda’s point enough to implement it in his own actions.

Chapter Text
Leia spent most of the trip researching Bespin, but she hadn’t paid attention to the scenery or infrastructure. She’d seen multiple articles raving about the beauty of the city, but they were all made for tourists and people looking to move there; that wasn’t what Leia needed to know.As Han pulled them into the atmosphere and pink-tinted clouds surrounded buildings soaring up around them, Leia thought that perhaps she should have paid attention to why everyone was raving about the planet’s beauty. It was gorgeous.Her jaw must’ve accidentally dropped because when she had seen enough to look away from the viewport, Leia found Han looking at her with a smile that was uncharacteristically soft. He scoffed as their eyes met, the smuggler half-grin returning to his face as he shook his head at nothing. Chewie looked strangely at him.Leia returned her gaze to the clouds before them. There was a large structure that seemed to be in the center of the world. Leia already knew about the large singular floating building that made up the city, but it felt smaller than described. Both the Empire and their contact were in there, and they were walking right in.She touched her blaster at her side and wished she’d made Luke give her the lightsaber before he left. She could handle herself without one, but it was certainly a trustier weapon than a blaster— besides, she’d be lying if she said she didn’t enjoy using a lightsaber, it was simply the truth of killing someone so close that startled her in the past.Luke was probably getting better use of his lightsaber in Jedi training, she thought dully. She was happy that Luke was getting the training he was made for, but a too large part of her wished he was there with her and the rebellion. With so many people gone and Ahsoka, Luke, and Leia separated again things felt disjointed. Leia blinked to herself and swallowed.She activated the external comm, “This is the Millenium Falcon here for a return shipment of tibanna gas, code twenty-eighty-three.”A tibanna gas mining colony didn’t need shipments of it, but the Imperials monitoring the channels wouldn’t notice that. They’d only hear a word commonly used in their transmissions and a code that they wouldn’t know had been given to the rebellion to use if they showed up.“This is my ship, you know,” Han said once Leia had clicked the comm off.“If I may interrupt,” Threepio interrupted before Leia could respond, “are the Imperials in the building we are currently requesting to enter?”“Well, yeah, that’s what the SOS said, genius.”“Unless the SOS was a trap made by the Empire to lure us in,” Leia said smoothly, staring at the building ahead as they waited for a response. It was taking too long, confirming that Imperials had taken control of the transmissions.Three heads turned to her with shocking speed. Leia smiled thinly to herself without looking at any of them.“Relax,” she said. “Our people would have caught it if it was a trap. Have more faith in us, all of you. Especially you, Threepio. At least these two are new here.”Chewie was the first one to snicker, and Leia turned her smile in his direction.There was still a gaping hole in her heart that seemed to darken everything, but she needed a sense of enjoyment. It didn’t feel like much, and it didn’t feel like it would have before, but her smile didn’t pain her.“I hate it when she jokes like that,” Threepio said in the direction of where Artoo would usually be.Han was still staring at her, but one side of his mouth was cocked in a grin. Leia raised her brows at him to challenge him to say anything, but both sides of his mouth upturned instead.“Affirmative, Millenium Falcon. You may dock on the lower east side landing pad.”The eye contact between them was broken as Han turned back to the controls. He sped up fast enough to push Leia against her seat— she was more than accustomed to it— as he swerved around the large structure. Leia simply took in the beauty of the view.The architecture reminded her of Alderaan.The thought was like a punch to the gut. Leia leaned off of her seat and looked at the console rather than the viewport, suddenly unwilling to look at the curved white architecture. She could only see Aldera in her mind, and with that came Bail and Breha and their daughter and everyone else.“Leia-“ Threepio started, but she straightened and fixed herself physically before he could go on.Han landed the ship. He gave her and Threepio a strange look, but she only raised her brows expectantly. For the miraculous third time since leaving hyperspace, he kept his mouth shut,As soon as they touched down Leia zipped her jacket. It would undoubtedly be cold in the city in the clouds. It wasn’t her most glorious outfit, but it was made for walking around the halls of a rebellion flagship and for all of the possibilities of combat that her job brought. She was lucky that Rex didn’t make her wear armor.“Would you wait up?” Han shouted from the cockpit as she marched toward the ramp.The images of Aldera were still in her mind, and she was determined to distract herself enough to get them out. She patted the braided loops her hair was in and took a deep breath as Han, Chewie, and Threepio all walked in behind her. Han came first, rushing with Threepio close on his heels. Leia could have sworn she saw Chewie roll his eyes.Leia smacked open the ramp and walked down. Somewhat surprisingly, there was no one there. It wasn’t as if she’d expected a full landing party, but someone there to meet them after going through the trouble of getting a transmission to the rebellion was admittedly expected.Doors that she hadn’t even noticed opened, and four men walked out. Leia would bet good money that the one in front was Lando Calrissian. With nicely fabricated, non-uniform clothes and an extravagant cape that even Imperials would stick their noses up at, he seemed like the type of man she’d read about.“We’re with the rebellion, my name is…” Leia started to introduce herself, but the man in front wasn’t paying attention to her.Beside her, Han stepped forward and clapped his hands. His face was tied between a grimace and a smile, and Leia almost regretted letting him come.“Well, would you look who it is, I knew it as soon as I saw the ship!” Lando— Leia had no doubts about his identity anymore— said extravagantly.“Look at me?” Han pointed a finger at his own chest. “You’re the one running a colony out here!”“And you just came with the rebellion! You’ve either cleaned up a whole lot or you got yourself in some massive trouble,” Lando laughed as both men walked closer to each other.Leia didn’t sense any hostility from any of the men. They were cautious, and they all seemed fatigued, but they weren’t going to attack.Chewbacca said something, and Lando looked at him.“Chewie! Ey, are you making sure this bastard takes care of my ship?”“Your ship?” Han asked, and Leia couldn’t resist raising her eyebrows at Lando’s implication. She’d never asked how Han got a hold of the Falcon. “I won it fair and square!”“Oh, yeah, with that scam you pulled last time!” Lando’s voice grew angry, but she felt that he was still humorous. “Don’t think I forgot about that!”Han’s smile dropped into something that was almost fear, and if Leia didn’t have a gaping hole in her chest and wasn’t on rebellion business, she might have burst out laughing. Chewie was chuckling from beside her.Before Han could get any words out, Lando burst into laughter and the two men hugged.“Oh, thank the maker,” Threepio said from beside her, and Leia merely shook her head.The action seemed to distract Lando, because he looked back at her and straightened.“Well, well, what were you saying?” he lowered his voice and took her hand.Men on Alderaan used to do the same, and Leia merely cocked a smile. She was here to help this man’s colony, not be wooed by him. Han’s frown returned from behind Lando as she smiled.“Leia Tano. We were told Imperials are here? Not listening, I hope,” she took her hand back in case anyone opened fire.She didn’t miss Han’s surprise at her chosen surname for this mission. It wasn’t as if she ever used her real one, even if Vader now knew that she and Luke existed. That was half of why she was bold enough to use Tano— usually, that was only their cover if Ahsoka was with them when they were kids.“No, no, they think we’re just bringing in a shipment,” his voice kept the same lusciousness as he turned to Han, and Leia truly raised her eyebrows. ”Do you happen to have any crates?”Han crinkled his nose, “Matter o’ fact, I do. Threepio, get them!”“Oh, my, I am a protocol droid-“Leia turned to him, “Threepio.”He turned with quiet mumbling that Leia was sure were complaints about his treatment. It was times like this that she was thankful for growing up with a fugitive, considering that it meant she knew they needed the crates for a cover. They couldn’t come in to deliver things just to walk in with laughter without any crates.Leia knew this from using covers for the rebellion, of course, but she also knew it from watching Ahsoka be forced to act like the criminal she technically was. Han sure as hell knew how these things went, and considering that Lando had suggested bringing the crates, he did too.“You two may follow me. We have much to discuss,” Lando kept the luscious tone in his voice as if they were about to discuss their favorite alcohols, but Leia could see the tenseness in his jaw.They walked into the large white curved structure that Leia saw as Aldera when she blinked. Thankfully, the inside didn’t remind her of the comfortable interiors that Alderaanians filled their homes with. The furniture was all regal and white, with a rare spot of green poking out in the shape of a plant.Leia eyed every inch of the ceiling for monitoring devices, but it was difficult without any proper corners in the ceiling. If she was sure there were no cameras she’d start feeling the walls for anything, but she couldn’t do that.Who was she kidding, if the Empire had cameras installed they’d already recognize her at this point. Her stealth was gone.“There’s no monitoring devices here, that’s why we chose this corner,” Lando said as he and he swept toward her and Han.Chewie was also eyeing the room, and Leia nodded at him. She wished Artoo was there.“Good,” Leia turned to Lando. “So, what’s your people’s situation?”“Now, who are you exactly? I know Han, and I don’t know how he got in the rebellion but I know him, so who are you?""Leia sighed heavily and looked at Han, who merely shrugged.“As I said, my name is Leia Tano. I’m a commander in the rebellion and a former participant in the Alderaan legislative program. I’ve been involved in rebellion affairs my entire life and have been a spy more times than I can count, and I know how little time your people have before the Empire fully takes over, if it hasn’t already. You’d be smart to start talking so we can start moving.”At the very least, Lando’s suspicion of her identity meant he cared for his people. They stared at each other for a long moment as if testing how much they could trust the other.Lando nodded and stepped back, sighing in relief.“Thank you. They arrived two days ago with just a small force. Only a few stormtroopers and an officer claiming more of them were coming. We’ve been lucky enough to avoid the Empire since we’re such a small operation, but it was always a chance that they’d show up. I thought they’d just take over the mining details, which wasn’t ideal but is tolerable for the people, but now they’re establishing curfews!”It was the same story Leia and every other rebel had seen and witnessed uncountable times. The Empire started small enough for people to be complacent, assuming that they were simply the next government body that may or may not be irritating.It never stayed that way. That was why there was a rebellion. Their arrival was always a sign of trouble to come, especially for those in less than ideal circumstances. From what she’d read, Bespin was known for its political freedom and distance from the Empire. That was all about to change.Leia nodded, “That’s how it usually happens. How many people are in your city?”“Six million. The only other large station on the planet is purely for work.”Six million. Leia turned away from Lando, slowly walking around to think for a moment. Han was watching them, clearly out of his depth as he pretended to lounge on a couch. Chewie had left to keep an eye on the Falcon, and Threepio was sent to join him after grabbing the crates.“Usually, I’d say we have two options here,” Leia kept her chin high and her voice formal. She thought of Queen Amidala. “The rebellion could usually send forces to fight the small Imperial force here, but it would only expand the Imperial forces. More would come, bringing harsh regulations on your people. Even if we were to win, it’d be a hard wartime, and your people would suffer anyway.”When she looked back at him, Lando’s eyebrows were drawn together. It was a tough decision, but it wasn’t even viable, and she hated to have to tell him. Realistically, she shouldn’t have even framed it as an option. It had worked in the past, though. She thought of Lothal and the other rare planets that had been freed entirely when the rebel forces grew too big for the Empire to hand and the planet was deemed unnecessary.“Why do you keep saying usually, then?”Leia frowned, “I hate to say it, but the Rebel Alliance is drawn too thin. We have people across the galaxy on hundreds of planets trying to fight the Empire. Even if I could get together enough troops to send here, the Empire would send more than we can handle when they see how thin we are.”“Then what are we supposed to do? I’ve heard that even if the rebellion isn’t here the regulations will grow, and they already have!”Han moved as if he was going to stand, but Leia shook her head without looking at him. There was nothing he could do here. He was a hell of a pilot, and she’d admit he was a good rebel, but he wasn’t diplomatic in the least.“Circumstances will grow worse, yes. The only viable option I can give is to evacuate your people.”Lando stared at her for a long moment, but it was Han who spoke first, “Evacuate six million people?”“I’m not sure that’s possible,” Lando shook his head.Leia gave Han a harsh look, “We’ve evacuated a planet of eleven million before, and that’s only one I can remember off the top of my head. Your population is small compared to other planets, as I’m sure you’re aware. It won’t be easy, but we have locations for them, and at least they won’t have to live in submission.”Lando once again turned, looking up toward the ceiling and sighing. Leia didn’t envy him. She’d led people before, but she wasn’t what anyone would call a leader, and certainly not in the way Lando was. She couldn’t imagine holding an entire population of people’s lives in her hands and having to make a decision for them.Of course, it was up to the individuals entirely. No one could force them. The sad fact of the matter was that to anyone that wasn’t rich, likely human, and in the Empire’s pockets, this would be a threat and detriment to their lives; especially if they enjoyed moving freely and denied what the Empire wanted, as anyone should have the right to.“I need to speak to my people. I can’t make a decision like this myself, it isn’t fair.”“Just make sure the Empire doesn’t overhear. That would make this significantly more difficult.”Lando turned to the only one of his people who hadn’t left the room. He had a mechanism on his head and over his ears that Leia couldn’t imagine the use of, but Lando seemed to trust him. In a quiet tone he started talking and the two swept out of the room.Leia turned to Han, who was already staring at her with a look she couldn’t decipher. Instead of trying, she walked over to the window and looked at the clouds. It was a lovely view, one that she was happy to be able to appreciate.“So, how long have you been doing stuff like that?”Leia heard Han walking over but kept her eyes on the clouds. A cargo ship flew by.“What do you mean?”“Telling people there’s no good options and all their people have to be miserable. I mean, really,” he smirked from beside her.It was hard to smile at such a sentence, but somehow, she did.“I’ve only done it myself a few times. Ahsoka has been with me before, or…” she took a breath as Han glanced at her, “Bail. Or others from Alderaan. Luke was only with me once, and I think he almost cried.”“‘Course he did. This whole speech to leaders, really? That many times?”“It’s never the same, trust me. Always a different situation, but always the Empire taking over. Or regulations getting worse, or a million other cruelties. I watched Bail give this speech to a whole council of leaders once.”“Bail… Organa?”Leia straightened her posture and resisted the urge to wince as Han’s forehead wrinkled.“Yes.”“You said your last name was Organa, once. To the guy on Dantooine, when we were with Luke that one time. Now it’s Tano, huh?”“I was wondering when you’d mention that,” she smiled thinly.“Yeah, well, it’s weird. All the rebels just call you Leia. Commander Leia and all that. Same with Luke. Why?”Leave it to Han Solo to be the least subtle person in a room, she supposed. Then again, they were the only ones in the room, and she was the one who’d been raised in the rebellion. Of course she’d be more subtle.“We were raised by a survivor of the Jedi purge, Han. Of course we don’t give our real last names.”Han scoffed the way he always did at the mention of the Jedi. He’d made it clear he didn’t believe in the force, and Leia was tired of arguing about it.“So, what is it, then?”She looked at him with raised brows, tearing her eyes away from the lovely pink clouds.His grin only grew, “What, you don’t trust me enough yet?”Leia shook her head and looked back outside, her voice suddenly quiet, “Naberrie.”Blessedly, Han shut his mouth for a moment. She wasn’t sure why he seemed surprised. It was still a risk for the Empire to know who her birth parents were, but she felt it was only a matter of time. Vader knew about them and their possible association with Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka kept her secrets on what exactly that meant. Besides, Leia did trust Han.“‘That your mom’s real last name, too?”He never called Ahsoka by her title or Fulcrum, and Leia always rolled her eyes. Now, she just let herself smile as much as she genuinely could anymore.“Our birth mother's, actually.”Han looked at her, surprised yet again.Leia said, “The name has no real meaning to anyone anymore. She was a prominent figure on her planet, but she used a separate surname at all times. Still, I guess maybe some people could recognize it, so it’s a secret.”Han looked away from her and huffed a laugh, “And I thought my family history was a mess. You’ve got an adoptive Jedi-something mom and some mysterious famous birth mom.”“She’s no mystery to Luke and I. Ahsoka made sure of that.”Another ship went by outside, and Leia’s eyes followed it. The Empire hadn’t halted business yet. Han was quiet yet again, and Leia could only imagine what was going through his mind. She thought she was usually pretty good at telling someone’s character, but Han Solo continued to surprise her. She had no idea how his brain worked.Initially, she’d thought he only cared about money, as most criminals did. Then, he’d joined the rebellion, where there was certainly no profit to be made. Now he was helping out a friend with pure intentions and listening to her story about her surname, a story which he'd prompted. She couldn’t figure him out, but part of her knew that she wanted to.Just when she’d thought his silence had stretched on for too long, she felt a beam of panic from him. She turned to him quickly to find that his head was following the incoming ship, however he was watching it much closer than she had.“Han?”“I knew my luck would run out eventually,” he muttered as he hurriedly pulled out his comm. “Chewie, scan that Firespray ship that just came in to see if it’s who I think it is.”Leia looked back out the window and vaguely recognized the ship model as the one Han had named.“Han? Who do you think that is?”“Not a friend, that’s for sure.”“And?”He huffed and patted his vest, “Boba Fett, a bounty hunter. Unfortunately for me, he works for Jabba.”Han was right, but Leia should have seen it coming. They all should’ve prepared for when his luck ran out. He may have joined the rebellion and been acting as honorable as he must’ve always been, but he was also Han Solo, a criminal and smuggler. And the criminal known as Solo owed Jabba the Hutt a debt larger than anyone ever wanted to owe.Leia wanted to hit something.“Will he recognize the Falcon?”Han’s comm chimed and he lifted it up. Chewie said something in rapid shryiiwook that Leia couldn’t keep up with, but she did see the way Han’s face fell with dread.“Keep the engines hot,” Han said. “It’s Fett all right, and he just circled around twice to get a good look.”Leia stared at Han and debated shouting at him for a moment, but she took a deep breath and released as much frustration as she could. She knew she was holding in a lot of negative emotions, so she’d do the best she could to not overflow.“You go. Take the Falcon and get out of here, I’ll call in help.”His gaze snapped to her, “What? No way, I’m not leaving you here! You’re coming with.”“In case you forgot already, I have made a promise on behalf of the rebellion to Lando, your friend, and his people that I don’t intend to break. I'm going to help them, and I can’t do that if you’re getting dragged around in an attempt to make you pay your debt.”“You can help them another day, Princess. Right now, we gotta get out of here.”Leia didn’t even open her mouth to retort before the doors slid open and Lando, walked in, immediately raising his eyebrows at Han’s words. Han saw him and stuck out a peaceful hand, but Lando’s people had already readied their blasters.“Excuse me?”“I have no intention on leaving you in peril-“ Leia started.Han said, “I got myself in hot water with Jabba the Hutt and one of his people are here.”Lando didn't waste a moment, “And here I thought you turned over a new leaf!”“Hey I’m trying here, but I’m sure you know old dealings always come back to bite you in the ass!”“Well sure, that’s why I don’t deal with Jabba the Hutt!”“Enough,” Leia pushed Han back from where he and Lando were getting increasingly closer to each other. “Arguing like children isn’t going to solve anything! Han, you leaving makes the most sense, and it’ll get Fett out of this equation. I’ll call for backup, and you go back to the fleet.”“I don’t know why you think I’m just gonna leave you alone here, you’re underestimating Fett by thinking he’ll just follow me and that’ll be it! He’ll get Jabba’s goons all over this place.”“And maybe by the time they get here we’ll have found a solution to the Imperial mess and won’t have to deal with your mess.”“I’m not leaving you here alone,” he pointed a finger in her face that she whacked away.“That’s unlike you, Han,” Lando said, the urgency still in his voice but a different tone evident as he stared at Han with something Leia couldn’t pin.Leia wasn’t sure if she was dreaming or if Han’s cheeks pinked.“It’s Boba Fett, you gotta know how much of a threat he is, Lando.”“Yeah, which is why you’re such a fool for getting in trouble with him. Leia here seems perfectly capable of defending herself, though.”“I’m no coward, Lando.”“Han, you’re being ridiculous and you’re putting the people of this city at risk. We can’t openly defend ourselves from Fett without alerting the Imperials, if he hasn’t already done it, so the best thing to do is draw him out.”“But-“Leia was ready to slap him, but Lando cut in this time.“I might have a better idea. We don’t have to be the ones to fight him, maybe.”Leia tried not to wrinkle her face as she looked at Lando incredulously. Even Han, who seemed to think Leia was fragile, looked like he was going to laugh. It was Han’s debt that he was going to get in trouble for, so it seemed ridiculous to think anyone else could do their work. Leia wouldn’t want to put that on anyone.“What crazy scheme are you thinking up, Lando?” Han asked.“Oh, no, no crazy scheme. I happen to have a Mandalorian friend in town right now to purchase a hefty amount of tibanna gas. She’s not paying out of her own pockets, but she’s a good one, like Leia, so I imagine she’ll take any excuse to use her people’s credits for better things.”“A Mandalorian?” Leia asked, not quite understanding.“Fett’s a Mandalorian,” Han said.Suddenly, Leia understood some of the fear that Fett seemed to give everyone. Mandalorians weren’t to be messed with.“To fight fire with fire,” Lando smiled. “She’s actually the one who told me how to contact your people. She’s camped on Lothal, so this is a one time offer, otherwise you're on your own. It may be good enough of a distraction for you to help us at the same time.”Leia heard what he was saying, but the mention of a rebellion-associated Mandalorian woman on Lothal was enough to divert her attention. She’d cocked her head to the side at the mention, that of which Han had certainly noticed.“Was she actively in the rebellion a few years ago?”“Oh. Do we have a mutual friend?”Han looked between them, “What? I’m confused.”Leia and Lando shared a smile. If he was indeed talking about Sabine Wren, as she was sure he was, then Leia trusted her abilities against the bounty hunter.“Deal. Can you get her up here without alerting the Imperials?”“The Imperials don’t even know she’s here. Lobot will call her up.”Leia had only met Sabine Wren and the Spectre Cell once. She used to hear Ahsoka transmit missions to them all of the time, but they made too much noise for Leia and Luke to really be able to work with them. When she had met them, she’d been there on Alderaanian business.Lando was right. If they had to tackle two enemies at once, they might as well fight fire with fire.

Chapter Text
The force on Dagobah was light.Unlike the rest of the galaxy, it wasn’t entirely affected by darkness. It wasn’t safe from the darkness, either, but it was lighter than many places. The business of millions of lifeforms wasn’t filling the air, leaving it peaceful and desolate. It was teeming with life as much as any other place, but it was more serene.Any place would probably be this serene if Luke focused more often. He could feel the force around him and the water in the bog. He could feel how it flowed around his starfighter and how Artoo moved over the uneven ground. He could even feel Yoda, slow with age but wise and kind.Far, far away, Luke felt like he could feel everyone. Ahsoka. Leia. Han. Wedge. Beru. Even Biggs, who had died. They were all intertwined. He’d always been taught it, but now he felt it.All over, Luke could feel people dying. He could feel the pain, just as he could feel the light. Unfortunately, they were not at balance or at peace.Luke fell hard onto the dirt, the floating stones around him doing the same. He winced.That had been a good meditation session, though, even if it didn’t end peacefully. He felt lighter than he had before. Luke still felt the pain, however.“Master Yoda, I have a question.”Yoda told him questions were good, and Luke had been full of them. He had all sorts of ethical questions about the force and how a Jedi should handle things. He avoided making up hypotheticals after Yoda yelled at him for it and made him figure out why it wasn’t very becoming of a Jedi.Yoda didn’t answer from where he sat on a log with his eyes closed. Luke brushed the dirt off of his legs and winced at the pain still lancing through his backside as he stood, walking over to the Jedi Master.“What am I supposed to do if I can’t meditate in a situation?” he sat beside Yoda, who was now looking at him.“Hmm, more hypotheticals?’“No! This is a real question! There’s a war, and I definitely can’t meditate in a cockpit in the middle of a battle as my friends are dying. I understand meditation now, and it really does help, but what do I do if I can’t? It’s a hypothetical, sure, but it’ll happen.”Yoda sighed heavily, “War. No place in a war a Jedi has, but I understand. Remember your training. Hone your emotions! Depending on any one method, you will not. Do not fear death.”“You say it like it’s easy,” Luke leaned his cheeks on his hands.“Oh!” Yoda shouted suddenly, hitting Luke with his cane.“Ow! What was that for?”""You forget I fought in a war! Ahsoka, Obi-Wan, all of the Jedi! Easy it was not! Our path, it was not. Joined the conflict swiftly we did, and pay for it we certainly did. Understand I do that you must fight, but peacekeepers we are, not soldiers.”“I can’t leave them alone to fight,” Luke said quietly, thinking of Ahsoka and Leia and Han and Chewie and everyone else who was out there fighting. He couldn’t leave them alone.“Tell you to leave them alone I did not.”Luke opened his mouth to ask for more guidance, but instead, Yoda whacked him with his cane. It hurt, and Luke was sick of it, but it was Yoda’s sign that they were going to train. Luke realized that he walked himself into this; Yoda tried to get him to focus and reach into the force while multitasking, particularly with the force, and that was essentially exactly what Luke had been asking about.Minutes later, Luke was upside down in a handstand with Yoda atop his foot and a dozen rocks— and Artoo— floating around them. Luke had dropped poor Artoo more times than he could count, and he was sure the troublesome droid was going to tell Ahsoka and Leia.It was easier than it had been the first ten times, at the very least. Luke shut his eyes to keep off distractions and reach into the force, straying his attention from the task he was holding while still feeling in the force.“Don’t forget his questions about the past,” a sudden, core-accented voice said.Luke opened his eyes and saw Obi-Wan Kenobi floating not far from him. Two of the stones collapsed, and Luke felt extra pressure on his boot from Yoda.“Concentrate,” Yoda said.It took a moment, and Luke felt like he was going to collapse, but he kept everything else in place. He looked back at Obi-Wan.“Not important. Only a distraction it would be.”“There’s not much entertainment here. Let him indulge a bit, Master. Think of how many of us would have been losing our minds.""His mouth was curved in a playful smile and his eyes were crinkled, but there was a touch of sadness in them. There was a gravity in his voice toward the end of his sentence that Luke didn’t know the context of. There were things about Obi-Wan Luke didn’t know, perhaps that Ahsoka didn’t know, either.Yoda sighed.“The most reckless Master was Obi-Wan, hm.”When Luke looked back to Obi-Wan to catch a reaction, he was gone. Luke grew unsteady again as he recalled that Obi-Wan was in fact dead. It was easy to forget when he popped at random and often bickered or joked with Yoda, but Luke tried not to forget it. He’d died a horrible death just like the other Jedi, but Luke had a feeling something was different for him.“Passed onto his Padawan and Grandpadawan, this recklessness was.”Luke’s arm rocked slightly from where it suspended him and Yoda. His muscle was starting to burn.“Always reckless Padawan Ahsoka was, however.”Three more of the stones fell, and Artoo let out a loud beep. Even now, as they answered his questions, they were testing him. Thankfully, Yoda waited a moment before going on.“Chosen by a master, Padawan’s often are not. An accident Ahsoka’s instance was! Meant to be Obi-Wan’s Padawan she was— as requested by Obi-Wan. More of a test for Skywalker it was.”Luke truly wanted to stay up, but as soon as Yoda mentioned Skywalker, he and everything else toppled over. Artoo screamed, Yoda shouted, and Luke remembered how hard the ground hurt.“Master Yoda! Tell me more, please!”However, Yoda was already straightening himself on his cane and heading toward his hut.“Patience.”Laying on the ground covered in dirt, sweat, and bruises, Luke realized that while telling him about the past Yoda had also taught him more about Padawans. He’d wondered about that, after all. He figured Yoda was his Master, but he’d never been called a Padawan and Yoda never labeled himself as such.He’d never actually known that. Surely Ahsoka knew if Luke’s father wasn’t the one to choose her as his Padawan. Luke supposed he couldn’t know every little thing, but he found it curious. It felt like a big deal, yet it had never been mentioned.Luke flipped onto his back on the dirt, “What do you think, Artoo? More workouts or a snack?”In an irritating fit of spite, Artoo didn’t answer his question as he let out a dozen beeps about dropping him on the dirt.“Yeah, yeah, I’ll clean you up later. You always get dirty again as long as we’re here.”Upside down, Luke looked at the tip of his ship visible from the bog. He wondered how long it’d be before it couldn’t even fly. He wasn’t trapped, of course. He could always reach out to Ahsoka or Leia enough for them to know he needed help and they’d come. Besides, Yoda didn’t seem concerned about the ship, which made Luke hope he had some way to get it out— he’d knocked down Luke’s rope contraption early into his training and said he needed to trust the force more.Luke missed flying. He loved Jedi training in a way he never thought he would, despite the immense difficulties, but his place was often in the air. Luke had been grounded for roughly five months; without Leia, Ahsoka, or even his rebel friends or Aunt and Uncle. He was thankful for Obi-Wan’s contribution to his training.He wondered how Leia was doing. He felt bad for leaving after such a catastrophic thing had happened, but he doubted Ahsoka would let her struggle for too long.Hopefully, he’d find out soon. He couldn’t remain on Dagobah forever,“How is this going to work?”Leia turned slowly to face Han. He was pacing in the center of the room they’d been taken to on Cloud City, just as he’d been for the past hour. Leia had outlined the plan she’d gotten from Lando, but Han didn’t seem convinced.For someone who’d been so nonchalant about his debt previously, he was suddenly worked up about it. It wasn’t as if he’d turn himself in, and he certainly didn’t have the money to pay it off, so his only option of choice was to ignore it. Now, he couldn’t ignore it.Leia knew Han was a good man, but part of her was still shocked that he hadn’t run. It would have saved his ass. Yet, he’d argued for her safety, and she knew that he wanted to help the people of Bespin. He could help the people of Bespin, and they both knew it, but he wouldn’t leave. He was prioritizing her over anything else, and she didn’t think it was a good thing.Much to her irritation, a small part of her felt warm at the motion. She thought back to Lando’s sudden light look while Han and Leia argued over him leaving or not.Currently, she was more focused on not shouting at him. He was driving her out of her mind.“I’ve explained it twice already, Han. You know how it’s going to work. If you want to avoid getting captured, I’m going to need you to have some optimism.”“Oh, you’re going to need me too, huh?”Chewie shouted something in which Leia recognized the shryiiwook syllables for Han.“We’re all going to die,” Threepio muttered as Chewie shouted over Han’s protests.Leia had half of the nerve to yell at them all to be quiet as they waited for Lando and Sabine, but for a rare instance, the voices were overwhelming her. Threepio was speaking of their doom beside her, and all Leia could see was everyone who had already died. Even Han with all of his stupid confidence and admittedly attractive bravado was scared. Chewie was trying to talk sense into him, but Leia could sense his worry, too.For a short moment, Leia’s eyes began to sting and she found oxygen difficult as her mouth widened for a sob. Her legs felt like clouds and she wanted nothing more than to call on Ahsoka for help.Leia briefly saw Han’s eyes meet her’s, but then she heard the door swish open and felt a briefly familiar force signature with Lando. It was enough to push Leia back up. She swallowed and blinked furiously, breaking eye contact with Han even as he tried to walk past Chewie toward her. By the time he got close enough to open his stupid mouth, Leia was walking toward the door with raised posture.Sure enough, beside Lando was Sabine Wren. Her partially purple helmet was tucked under her arm, allowing Leia to see just as she felt that this was indeed the Mandalorian she’d met once before. It wasn’t as if they’d talked much, but doing an operation for the rebellion and fighting for your lives together made it hard to forget someone.Leia had also listened in to a dozen of Ahsoka’s transmissions to Sabine's rebel cell, in which Hera Syndulla mentioned Sabine and the rest of the crew more than enough times for Leia to remember some details.“Leia?” Han asked, but his voice was already drowned out as Lando swept toward them.Sabine either didn’t hear him or chose to ignore him as she strode toward Leia.“Leia,” she smiled. “Or is it Fulcrum?”They clasped hands in greeting, “It’s hardly ever Fulcrum. It’s good to see you, Sabine.”“You too, especially with everything going on. I’m so sorry about-““It’s fine,"" Leia stepped back and gestured her arm toward Han. Behind Sabine, Lando chuckled. “This is Han Solo, the reason we’re calling you in here today. Han, this is Sabine Wren, one of the heroes of Lothal.”Sabine’s cheeks pinked slightly at the mention, but her chin rose. Leia never got a chance to figure out the full story, but she knew that Ezra Bridger was the one who sacrificed himself for Lothal, so Sabine probably didn’t agree with the title. Leia didn’t care. Han, who Leia knew had heard the story of the first truly liberated planet, nodded at her in what Leia assumed was restrained respect.“Oh, you’re the one who managed to get Boba Fett after you? I don’t know how you managed it.”“It’s not Boba Fett specifically,” Han’s face wrinkled, and Leia resisted the urge to smile. “I have a debt to Jabba the Hutt-““Oh! Even better,” Sabine turned to Lando, Han, and then finally Leia. “I hate these types of people. If Lothal didn’t need tibanna gas, I’d never have come here.”Leia could sympathize with that, especially since she could see the smile on Sabine’s face. In the early stages of the rebellion people like Han and Lando were half of who they dealt with, so Sabine couldn’t possibly be intolerable of them. It was just fun to say it.“I don’t blame you, but I’m happy you are here. I assume Lando filled you in on the plan?”“I helped make it, so yeah. We know where Fett is?”Leia and Han looked at Chewie, who nodded.“Got it. I’ll go get in place, then.”“Lando, stay outta the way,” Han pointed at him before he could leave. “You’ve got people depending on you.”“Don't take me for a fool, Han. I don’t get involved with criminals.”Han opened his mouth for a retort, but Lando was already walking out, so Leia watched as he simply barked a laugh instead. They were extremely fortunate no one had bugged the room.Leia hoped that the rebels she’d contacted about evacuating the city would be on their way soon enough. Through protocol they’d send a squad of larger, civilian-prepped ships to wait somewhere nearby. When she gave the signal, they’d exit hyperspace.Lando had already begun quietly informing his people. While they dealt with this squabble, the rebellion would be working.“You could go help Lando, you know. Fett knows about Chewie being with me, but now he’ll put you on his list too.”“Han,” Leia walked right before him, looking up at him but raising her chin enough to make her seem taller. “I can take care of myself, and I know what I’m doing.”Han sighed and ruffled his own hair, “I know that, but it doesn’t mean you have to.”“I don’t have to do a lot of things, but I’m still here,” she smacked his chest and turned toward the walkway, “Don't go soft on me, flyboy.”She didn’t stick around to see the look on his face. Instead, she grabbed one of the large crates that were merely filled with oxygen and walked onto the walkway. Chewie moved out behind her. It might take some time, but Fett was definitely watching. They had to make sure this didn’t turn into a chase through the sky— if Fett was stupid enough to think he could beat Han in the sky, however, then he wasn’t possibly the bounty hunter everyone seemed to think he was. A dogfight would ruin the rebellions evacuation, though.“I hate these plans,” Threepio said quietly as he pushed a crate beside Leia.“We came in for a shipment, we get a shipment, Threepio. Easy as that,” she said roughly, pushing one of the crates toward the ship with movements that were much less formal than she usually used.As she walked back toward the room that the other crates awaited in, passing Han as he moved another crate toward the Falcon. Leia didn’t change her movements as she dipped into the force, although she did slow down slightly. She felt for lifeforms around, a task that she knew would be much easier if she had more training. Instead, she depended on being Anakin Skywalker’s child to give her enough strength in the force and found that she couldn’t sense anyone particular nearby.Leia’s nerves rose slightly more as she pushed another crate onto the walkway. Han was talking with Chewie loosely as Chewie moved the crates onto the Falcon. It was important that Han never boarded it.“Luke’s fine, wherever he is, pal! Probably having a hell of a lot better time than us!”Leia pushed another crate up the ramp but refrained from going up. Just as she and Han were about to turn back, Han opening his mouth to start some useless conversation, Leia felt a spark of danger.In a glaringly familiar moment, Leia saw a condensed stun bolt slamming into Han’s chest before anything moved in the air before them. It was the same thing that had happened the first time Luke ever got shot, when she’d accidentally woken up some battle droids, and the same thing that had happened a thousand times before.For a brief moment, at least some of her confidence in her abilities of the force were restored.Then, she looked in the direction of the bolt to keep her cover and grabbed Han’s waist, throwing him onto the ground with her entire weight. They both toppled down flat, Chewie doing the same on the ramp.Going flat wasn’t much use if there were no explosions and they had no cover.“Found him,” Han groaned as he and Leia both scrambled up, limbs overlapping in the pile she’d thrown them in.Before either of them could overthink it, Leia stood and pulled out her blaster. Instead of firing, she honed in on the sense of Boba Fett that she now had enough information to track down. He was tucked behind a satellite above them on the dome, in a rather creative hiding spot.Leia pulled out her comm, “Behind the-““I see him,” Sabine responded, and sure enough, a purple haze flashed through the air.There were few spots for Fett to hide in, so Sabine had been much higher on the dome. Now, she could simply drop on him.Fett had no fight with the Empire or rebellion, and Jabba the Hutt wouldn’t involve himself in the war. He was aligned with the Empire, but even that was testy at best.Leia raised her comm, “Rebel evac squad, come in. Sectors 3B, 8B, and 3C are most populated and most ready for you.”She took a deep breath and mentally thanked Sabine a dozen times over. Several layers above them on the dome Sabine and Fett were now engaged in a testy Mandalorian fight.Han, Leia, and Chewie ran onto the Falcon, useless crates be damned. The Empire would be too busy trying to see what was happening with Sabine and Fett, and by the time they realized whose ships were coming out of the sky, it’d be too late. They’d be able to get a good amount of the willing civilians out by the time the Empire was able to call in a viable amount of backup.Leia practically swung into the cockpit behind Han and Chewie, who were starting up the engines in record speed. She was hardly in her seat by the time the ship was thrown into the air.Sabine would take care of Fett for them. She’d also get a whole lot more tibanna gas than expected, even if the stores for it were about to be abandoned. That was the deal.Without civilians, there were two possibilities on Bespin. The Empire would abandon it, having enough access to tibanna gas on other planets and hopefully underestimating Bespin itself. Without anyone to control, it’d be hard to efficiently gather all of the gas they could. Despite their vast power, most of their resources were going to the war.If the Mining Guild came in, they’d supply workers, but they liked to cut costs. They wouldn’t do that without any ready slaves available on the planet already, especially not with expenses going higher as the war waged.The other possibility was that the Empire would abandon the planet. They’d probably leave some sort of monitoring devices for activity, but the rebellion could come in and quickly install defenses. Eventually, after a likely battle over the territory, the civilians could come home and resume their lives.As Han circled around the station, Leia pulled up her datapad. She’d already put things together for the planets they’d transport the civilians too— they’d be split amongst four planets far in the Outer Rim. The rebellion had them in circulation for years, and now they were being put to use. Hopefully, it was only temporary.“Oh, why can’t we just leave,” Threepio said, putting his hands over his optical receptors.“Don’t pretend like you don’t know the plan,” Leia lightly hit his arm.They got close to the part of the dome the Imperials had taken over when suddenly and inevitably a scream of TIE engines cut through the unbreathable atmosphere behind them. Leia took half a second to groan and resist stomping her feet in frustration before she was up and running to the gunners seat.She’d never used the weapons seat in the Falcon, but she’d be damned if she couldn’t fire a few shots. She’d done it a thousand times before in the Sky Walker. Han yanked the ship hard enough to slam her into the gunners seat, but she continued to reach for the comm and adjust it to fit her correctly.“If you could hurry up, that’d be nice,” Han said as soon as her comm came online.Leia readjusted her seat and switched on the controls, “Maybe if you hadn’t thrown me into the wall, I would’ve moved faster.”“I can arrange that!”Leia scoffed and grabbed the firing controls. She leaned forward in her seat, but Han had them at a terrible angle. She could only assume that he had the ship angled for him or Chewie to shoot at the TIE, forgetting that she was here now.“I can’t do anything if you don’t give me a shot!”Something incomprehensible was shouted into the comm, followed by Chewie saying something that Leia hoped was on her side. A moment later, the ship angled upward and the TIE showed up in the scopes and the viewport.Leia didn’t hesitate to angle herself to be facing it, trusting the gut instinct that she knew was more than that. She didn’t even wait for the scopes to focus, hearing Chewie protesting through the comm before she shot.The TIE blew up.Han let off a victory shout. It was such a small occupation that there weren’t many TIEs considering the lack of extended hangars. TIEs couldn’t simply park on the landing platforms consistently; nor did they have hyperdrives, and there wasn’t even a star destroyer here yet.Yet. One could very well emerge.The sensors went off as several large ships emerged from hyperspace above the atmosphere, but Leia merely smiled. The rebels were here. She was already hopping out of her seat by the time Han landed the Falcon right next to the Imperial stronghold.They were going to send out alarms to other Imperials, anyway, so they might as well try to attack the preexisting squad. When more would be arriving, then all of the damage they could do meant something.Leia converged with Han and Chewie in the lounge. Chewie had already pulled out his bowrifle, and Leia and Han were both grabbing their blasters.“Luke needs to start giving the me the lightsaber,” Leia muttered as she walked off of the ramp with her blaster raised.“Yeah, then you can both chop people’s heads off,” Han said, shooting much more frivolously than Leia.She’d be the last one to admit she frequently liked Han’s jokes, but she frowned at that one. Her first time using the lightsaber on a real person had been horrifying, and it wasn’t something she satisfied; but, that fear didn’t mean she’d shy away from using the better weapon. She was over it. Nonetheless, the joke wasn’t very funny.Leia turned back momentarily, “Stay on the ship, Threepio!”Leia sidestepped the few bolts coming their way and threw a cautious glance beside her to make sure Han was doing the same. Stormtroopers didn’t have very good aim, but they got lucky sometimes. Leia saw a phantom of a bolt scratching Chewie’s arm as he raised his bowcaster and flexed her fingers slightly, watching the incoming bolt whizz past him.“Now!” Han shouted.Chewie roared and raised his bowcaster, shooting the wall above the doorway that the troopers were firing from. Immediately, the doorway collapsed. They were close enough to the top of the dome that it didn’t cause any significant infrastructure problems.The three of them ran across the walkway before a TIE or anyone else could show up to attack them. Sabine was out of sight, but when Leia reached for it she could feel her life-force. She was still alive, and she’d remain that way. Chewie grabbed pieces of the collapsed wall to heft them out of the doorway to enter while Han and Leia gave them cover.After three seconds of Chewie chucking rubble off of the large structure, Leia took a breath and swung her hand to the side. With much more mental strain than either of her companions saw, the rubble moved enough for them to slip in through the side.Chewie chuckled, but Han’s eyes were as wide as saucers. He scowled.Leia flashed a cocky smile at him and stepped through the walkway with her blaster raised. The initial room was empty, showing how truly small this Imperial unit was. They’d arrived on a shuttle with two gunships worth of stormtroopers and set things up. It was a a true confirmation that even the Empire was stretched thin if they didn’t arrive with a star destroyer. Perhaps they underestimated the population— or they hadn’t read the news of how Bespin centered around political freedom. They were never going to be content with the Empire taking over their home.Leia was thankful that this wasn’t an Imperial base itself, but it did mean she didn’t know the layout or the checkpoints for troopers. She slowly rounded a corner and found three troopers standing ready. As she ducked behind the wall, Chewie shot once from his bowcaster and took care of them.It didn’t take long to get past the measly amounts of troopers and to what Leia assumed was the main control room. It had two officers, a colonel and a lieutenant. They couldn’t even bring in a general for such a small operation, it seemed.As soon as they walked in both officers put their arms up, knowingly outnumbered. Leia shot the comms, even thought they’d undoubtedly already been used to alert the Empire. The fact was evident in the way the colonel’s lip turned up even as Han pointed a blaster at him.“You’ll never get away with this, rebel scum.”Leia ignored him in favor of booting up one of the systems to see how many transmissions had been sent out and what they outlined.“What do you think we’re getting away with?” Han scoffed.He shouldn’t have even asked.“Committing treason and defying the name of our glorious Emperor-““Oh, shut up.”Leia rolled her eyes and mentally took stock of everything she’d need to report back to rebel command.Suddenly, an alarm went off in her head. Before she could see anything, she spun around and flicked her hand, sending the blaster that the lieutenant had been pulling out flying. He stared at her, but the colonel suddenly pulled out his own small blaster.Han shot him as his bolt merely slammed into the wall. The lieutenant continued to stare at Leia from where he’d pressed himself against the wall.She didn’t usually use the force so much, but the Empire would find out she had it sooner or later, if they didn’t already know. Instead of scowling at being proven that the force does in fact exist, Han grinned and cocked his head toward Leia while looking at the lieutenant. Leia rolled her eyes much more lightheartedly this time and shut off the system.She tuned into her personal comm on the rebel channel and heard that the evacuation had begun. Then, Han got Lando to send his people up to take care of the Imperial. He was in their hands now; the rebellion didn’t have a prison system.Once again, they ran back into the Falcon. When they got back to the platform, Sabine was the only one there. Leia and Han looked at each other with brows raised.“Either he’s dead or I’m gonna walk out and get arrested,” Han said, clearly doubting Sabine as Han landed the Falcon near her.Leia didn’t know exactly how talented Sabine was in a direct fight with another Mandalorian, but she did know that she’d never betray the rebellion, and therefor Han. Somehow, she’d beaten Fett, though Leia was curious as to what means.“I trust her,” Leia stood and threw her previously discarded jacket back on. It hadn’t been needed while they attacked the Imperials, but the Bespin air was cold. She patted her braids and found them all in place.“Who is she, anyway? You know her?”“Hardly. She was part of a rebel cell Ahsoka advised. I did one operation with her team.”Han nodded exaggeratedly, “Right. So… that makes you trust her?”“Ahsoka trusts her, and she’s no fool. Sabine’s a good rebel. I wouldn’t trust her with… my surname, or training Luke to be a Jedi, but I trust her enough. Besides, she had two Jedi on her crew.”“Is that supposed to mean anything to me?”“Well, you can’t exactly deny them anymore.”“I’d hope not, since Luke’s been off with them for months.”Leia scoffed at his specific wording and how little he knew about the Jedi. If he was really sticking around with her family, then he’d learn it all soon enough.They stepped off of the ramp to where Lando was now waiting beside Sabine. He had Lobot and his team with him, but they’d all hung back. Higher up, Leia could see the evacuation ships making their way around. They didn’t have long.“Maybe you are good for something, Han,” Lando shouted as they walked over.Chewie said something in response that Lando chuckled at.“I never said I wasn’t! Mando, what happened with Fett?”Lando checked the datapad in his hand for the second time; he was stressed for his people. Leia pretended not to notice and decided to make this a quick goodbye.“My name is Sabine, sleemo. We fought a lot, came to a stalemate, and then I chased him away when he saw the rebel ships. Jabba the Hutt would be in a whole lot of trouble if his people got caught on the rebels side of the war. Nobody wants to be seen associating with me.”Leia smiled at her final statement; it was a sentiment Leia shared, although to a slightly lesser extent. Sabine was part of the team to liberate a planet, which made her quite lethal in the eyes of the Empire.Lando whistled and Han scoffed with a nod, “Well, thanks. I don’t owe you anything, though, since you get the gas.”“Don’t worry, I wouldn’t want you to owe me anything.”“They’re loading your tibanna gas onto your ship right now,” Lando said. “Be careful transporting it.”“Oh, I will.”Lando smiled and turned to Han, “Thanks for coming, you bastard. You almost screwed this up, but somehow it worked. Leia, I appreciate you immensely. This is hardly ideal, but it’s better than the alternative. I hope the rebellion can work with us in the future to get these people home.”Leia shook the hand held out to her, “I’m happy to be of help. These things aren’t ever easy, but you’ve been more cooperative than most.”“That’s surprising. Han, you’re still a son of a bitch. Stay safe fighting in this rebellion, and keep my ship intact. I need to tend to the evacuation, now.”“Yeah, yeah, be careful yourself here. I know you can fly, so if you ever get bored with whatever scheme you have here, come join us. It’s fun.”Lando turned with a laugh, “Keep dreaming. It was nice meeting you, Leia! Thank you, Sabine. Give the Governor my regards.”Sabine tossed out an arm as Lando walked away, but she rolled her eyes facing Leia, “Lothal's Governor would hate to know who I’m getting this gas from. He doesn’t even ask anymore.”Leia smiled, “Well, I hope it helps you all. We need to depart, but thank you for the help, truly.”“Of course, I’m always up for a good fight. Tell Ahsoka I say hi,” Sabine’s smile grew into something slightly more playful. “You know, when Lando first said that you, one of Ahsoka’s people, needed a favor from me, I got scared it was Jedi stuff. Like, Vader or something.”“Vader?”“Oh, yeah, don’t worry though. I did some digging before I agreed. He’s on Naboo last I saw, so we’re all fine.”Han scoffed to agree with Sabine’s statement, but Leia’s blood ran cold.Without saying a word, she focused on the force and tugged hard on the connection that had always bound Luke and Leia together. She tried to push all of the panic at the revelation toward him for some miracle that he’d understand and join her.Vader being on Naboo at the same time as Ahsoka wasn’t an accident.Leia felt Luke’s worried acknowledgement, but the force wasn’t like an actual conversation. She’d have to comm him.“Isn’t… Vader being in the mid rim a good thing?” Sabine asked only after Han had looked at Leia and grabbed her shoulder.Leia blinked out of the slight stupor she’d put herself in trying to reach Luke. Ahsoka wasn’t safe. She was in huge danger. Whatever lead she was following— whether or not it was a trap, though Leia felt that it had to be— was dangerous. No matter how strong she pretended to be, Vader scared Ahsoka. That was enough to say that them being on the same planet put her in extreme danger.She needed to talk to Luke.“For the rebellion yes,” she cleared her throat. “I’m sorry Sabine, I need to go. It was good seeing you.”Leia turned and walked back to the Falcon, ignoring Han and Chewie’s protests.Ahsoka needed help.Vader was the one thing that she’d been firm in never revealing things about without a real reason, and the single fight between him had somehow changed every interaction with Ahsoka since.Leia didn’t care about safety. She didn’t care about all of the times Ahsoka had saved Luke and Leia or how capable she was on her own. All she cared about was the obvious fact that she couldn’t handle Vader herself, and that she was in immense danger.Leia was going to get Luke, and they were going to save Ahsoka. They had no choice.

Chapter Text
Padmé missed her handmaidens. If for nothing else, because she really did not want to be in this particular meeting. Her back was sore, and she really needed to find a refresher, but couldn’t afford to miss the rest of this council session on the off chance something important happened. Handmaidens solved this problem, and many others. She tried to console herself with the thought that they were all well (as well as they could ever be without being together) and performing roles that they chose throughout the galaxy. Distantly, Aavi Ioka kept speaking, the latest in a series of monologues demanding changes in hyperspace lanes for the convenience of the Chiss. As much as Padmé knew it was going to be a struggle to do anything about it, she could recognize that it would be an advantageous move to begin making. If the Chiss could not make it to Coruscant without difficulty, they’d be less likely to continue attending the (endless) senate meetings, councils, and political parties that were required for a Republic ally. There were others who would be willing to make the trip to Csilla. Many others. The only reason Padmé hadn’t spoken to Senator Ioka yet was because she wanted to be sure she truly had something to offer, before running off and promising the Republic’s time and energy to building a new hyperspace lane, purely for the Chiss to use. She’d mentioned it to Bail, handed the information to Versé, and tried to let the urgency of the situation slip from her mind. Even so— it was one of Aavi’s top concerns. “You claim that it is fair to be penalizing us for missed meetings, Councillor?” She had moved to addressing an unofficial Twi' consultant, who had been looking less than pleased with the proceedings for several minutes. Padmé sighed, knowing she’d need to intervene soon. “My planet is buried in the unknown regions, with no hyperspace lanes reaching us. We must navigate the whales, and asteroid belts, and moons that have yet to be discovered and recorded, while you sit here on your gilded throne being hand-fed piatii berries! You declare meetings less than two full rotations before they begin, knowing that I am still several days from arriving, and then blame it on my inability to keep a schedule?” Padmé sat up incrementally more (as if there was much room to slouch in this dress. Rabé had insisted on the bulletproof ribbing, and ignored the accusations that it was a ploy to correct the posture she was always hassling everyone else about) at this, watching the Twi’lek shift their weight. 

“Yes, I did hear about that. And I’d appreciate if you kept your comments on my wardrobe to yourself— I understand that you hail from a warmer planet, Councillor, but I must be dressed for Csilla’s windchill just as easily as a hastily-planned high-rise dinner party.” Aavi narrowed her eyes at the Human senator accompanying the Twi’, and everyone knew it was a jab at the party he had hosted last week in an attempt to catch only those who were native to Coruscant and the inner rims. Most people leave between sessions— returning to home worlds to discuss, making diplomatic visits, or checking on whatever spies they inevitably have nestled around the galaxy. Even Padmé hadn’t made it to that party, but Senator Ioka, who didn’t have the time to make it to Csilla and back before the next session, was one of very few off-worlders who made it. Padmé starts mentally rearranging her schedule to make more room for this new hyperspace lane. She’s admired Aavi for longer than they’ve known each other, and known her longer than they’ve gotten along. This kind of move is not only an attempt to gain political favor, but a gift for a friend who misses her home. Padmé understands that. At the thought of Naboo, that dull ache where her handmaidens should stand reappears. She adds a side-note to check when Sabé is supposed to be on-world again. Inhaling carefully, Padmé leans forward and presses on the lever that will pull her platform forward in order to speak. If she does not step in now, the Chancellor will be forced to, and as much as anyone loves to hear him talk about himself, Padmé would rather make it out before sunset. “Senator Ioka, Naboo recognizes your concerns, for they are ours as well. Even the Mid Rim struggles to keep up with the busy schedules of many senators on Coruscant. I’m sure that Councillor Gesa and Senator Tejunt,” Padmé nods towards both of them as she speaks, “Had only meant to find time for a gathering when there was little to be had. Even I struggle to find the time to meet with my close friends, these days,” There is a light-hearted and placating smile added to the end, meant to settle the argument and appeal to all sides. Anakin frequently complimented Padmé’s ability to solve all sides of an issue at once— making Aavi feel seen, acknowledging her anger and the anger of many others here, without giving enough of an insult to hurt her reputation with Senator Tejunt. Or Gesa, for that matter. Councilors are as effective spies as a bug slipped into a datapad. “And I’m sure, as well, that there will be other parties in the near future. It’s not as if it’s hard to catch everyone on the same planet at the same time,” She gestures around the room, earning a small laugh echoing throughout the chamber. “Regarding the issue of the hyperspace lanes, would you be able to contribute any kind of maps or documentation to the most common obstacles on your usual route, in the case that the resources were found?” A silent promise is forged here, the slightest hint that it’s already in the works. “Our pilots generally keep very good records of-” Aavi starts to speak, and cuts herself off as Chancellor Palpatine’s stand floats towards the center again, propelling her back towards her dock. She shares a look with Padmé— the incessant exhaustion of being silenced by everyone in this Senate. Padmé nods, hopefully Aavi gets the message to find her later. Padmé adds a reminder to contact Aavi in a few days if she doesn’t receive the maps to the list. “Thank you for your opinions, Senators Ioka and Amidala,” Palpatine begins. Padmé leans back again, knotting her hands in her lap and gnawing slightly on the inside of her cheek in an imperceptible display of annoyance. “But unfortunately, it is time to concede the session. I know that there are many here who wish to catch the shuttle off-world at 21, so we really mustn’t run much later. Motion to end session,” A wave of vote lights appears throughout the chamber, and Padmé grits her teeth as she agrees to end. “Unanimous. Have an excellent evening, everyone, and don’t forget that we already have a session scheduled for next month. Information will be sent soon,” Palpatine’s own stand docks again, and the chamber fills with the sort of delicate small-talk that comes as everyone peels themselves from their seats, not quite able to discuss the day’s events yet. “Would you like assistance, Senator?” Gregar asked, nearly under his breath, as Padmé hesitated before getting up. Padmé considered for a moment, the ache in her back and neck, and the fact that she hadn’t eaten in over six hours (a consequence of such sessions, and one that would have to be quickly remedied if she wasn’t going to collapse during her evening work) before nodding, once. A carefully perfected routine that even Quarsh Panaka couldn’t get just right, Gregar stepped up next to Padmé and acted as if he were leaning in to tell her something, placing his hand on her back and grabbing the anchor strap hidden as a belt— another gift from Rabé, and a very useful one, as they all are. “One,” Padme pulls herself together, bracing to stand. “Two,” She nods, as if receiving some kind of instruction. “Three,” Gregar pulls her up as she stands, and the two of them steer her quickly around their seats and into the small, airlock-like space between rooms. An awful lot of effort just to hide the fact that Padmé can barely turn her head in this dress without breaking it. The effort of maintaining that Amidala look, she decides. “Thank you, Gregar, if you’d see me to my rooms you can be dismissed for the evening. I’m sure that Ele has missed you,” Padmé teases. “Threepio, time to go,” Threepio snaps awake all at once, realizing that the meeting has ended. “Excellent work today, Senator. You’ve received four messages from your wardrobe mistress, one from Senator Organa, and three from my maker. Would you like to hear them?” “From Rabé or Dormé?” Padmé takes a water bottle and a nutrient bar from Gregar’s hands, opening both. “Rabé. She wishes to discuss changes to two of your headdresses, and needs updated measurements from Dormé for a new dress that she has begun to plan. Would you like me to inform her that you’ve been notified?”“Yes please, Threepio,” Padmé replies, holding a hand over her mouth as she tries to eat the nutrient bar. Gregar waits patiently by the door, ready to open it as soon as she’s done. “Forward my messages from Senator Organa to my personal datapad, and I assume that you have repairs tonight?” “Yes, ma’am. I believe as soon as we arrive.” “Alright, I have to speak to Aavi before we go home, but that should be all for tonight. Gregar, do you know where—” “Right here, Senator,” Gregar steps aside, revealing the trash chute so that Padmé can dispose of the wrappings for her hasty snack. A desperate attempt at reducing the amount of times that she faints on her way out of a session, apparently a notorious problem among Human senators. You’d think that would lead to a change in the policy for the length of a session, or the policy on food in the chamber, but no. And who is Padmé to argue with that, she rolls her eyes bitterly. “Any crumbs?” “No, sir,” Gregar replies. “Part of your collar isn’t sitting correctly, though. May I?” Padmé shifts her head slightly in response. The annoying part of picking the costume as part of her image is that she has to maintain a costume as part of her image. Officially, Rabé and Dormé are the managers of her wardrobe— Rabé mostly operating from Naboo, occasionally coming to make alterations and finalize the fittings for new outfits, but Dormé is the one who assists with the day-to-day, also acting as a decoy when necessary— but really, anyone who spends any manner of time with her as a friend ends up assisting. Gregar straightens her collars, helps her ensure that her sleeves drape appropriately (always asking before making such adjustments, and only ever doing them out-of-sight as well) and reminds her to shift certain ways to show off the draped jewelry most outfits feature.   “How do I look, Threepio?” Padmé asks the droid, turning towards him. He starts, raising his hands. 

“Exquisite as always, Senator. I’m sure that there will be no negative comments on your state of dress tonight.” He says with finality. High praise, from a droid. “Alright, out we go then.” As Gregar opens the door, the noise from the hallway envelopes the group. Padmé steps forward, knowing that Gregar will fall in behind her and ensure that Threepio doesn’t get lost, as well as act as a boundary to ensure no one steps on her skirts— intentionally or otherwise. The dress she’s wearing today isn’t quite as extravagant as the Amidala dress (as she’s taken to referring to the elaborate red dress and matching headset that she wore to her first Senate session) but it is definitely close. This one is a darker red, meant to compliment Padmé’s skin, but it shimmers in such a way that means that you can’t quite pin what color it really is. This was Rabé’s idea, and it was designed to become known as Padmé’s favorite dress. Because of how the fabric shifts, it means that it is harder to quite pin down the color of Padmé’s skin. This means easier transition to decoys, as well as an ability to hide if she spent a weekend on a Nabooian beach or hidden in an underground bunker. The square neck barely shows her collarbones, and the fitted nature of the torso (designed to appear made flattering for Padmé’s thin body) is smoothed out by the bulletproof corset built into the inside. The skirt flares around her hips, allowing freedom of movement in her lower body so she can run if needed, and drapes into a small train. The matching headdress is simpler than many that she wears, but it essentially locks her head into place, forcing excellent posture. Another defense against attack (it’s nearly impenetrable from the back), as well as against endless Senate meetings. “You can’t slouch if your dress won’t let you” is what Rabé had said. Ignoring the side eyes she was getting from many other Senators, Padmé makes her way across the hall, closer to Aavi’s exit, in the hopes to find her. Nearly halfway there, she hears someone calling her name over the buzz of the crowd— a side effect of thousands of senators in a small space— and she has to nearly spin around to find Aavi walking towards her. “Senator Ioka!” Padmé says, leaning forward in the mimed cheek-kiss they always exchange. Aavi takes her hand and leads her out of the hallway, both sets of attendants and guards falling back to the standard ‘respectful’ distance as they use the walking speed to arrange the finery of a Senate-appropriate outfit without tripping each other. Padmé is always jealous of the coats that Aavi wears, and how warm they look. Not to mention lighter.  “I appreciate you defending me today, Senator Amidala,” Aavi says carefully. There are ears everywhere. “And I’m sorry for dragging the session on for so much longer than planned, I’m sure that many others are quite cross with me for that,” She adds with a laugh. “Oh, it’s my pleasure, I had just hoped to end another argument before it sprung up. You’re absolutely right, on all accounts, but there is only so much lecturing that can take place before people stop thinking with logic and start thinking with annoyance.” Padmé replies lightly. “And with the Senate you can never tell which is which,” Aavi nods in agreement. “I know, I know. For someone who started after I did, you’ve always been better at this than me.” “I wouldn’t phrase it as better, Senator. I doubt I will ever perfect the art of the glare of disapproval.”“Ah, well, that just comes from having children. I’d hope you wait at least a little bit longer before learning that particular skill,” She looks off into the middle-distance, and Padmé is bracingly aware of the lines in her face. Aavi has children, Padmé knows this. She doesn’t talk about them, either. Padmé stops their procession towards the personal offices and puts a hand on Aavi’s arm. “We appreciate your work here, Aavi. I’m sure that they will too, even if they can’t understand what you’re working for yet.” “That’s actually part of what I hoped to speak with you about, I was wondering if you might have time tonight for a meeting with an old friend?” “You could wake me up in the middle of winter hibernation and I’d have time for you, of course. Would you like to meet in my office, or yours?” “I think yours is closer, and I know that I definitely would rather sit down sooner than later,” Padmé nearly forgets her professional laugh at Aavi’s pinched expression as she rolls her shoulders. “I understand completely, follow me, Senator,” Padmé opens the door to her office receiving room— left unlocked at all hours— and continues on to her personal meeting room— left unlocked exactly long enough to get the door opened and closed— directing Aavi inside and locking out both sets of guards and attendants. “Can we speak freely here?” Aavi asks without pretense, nearly flopping onto a couch. Padmé nods, sitting down as well, and pulling her shoes off with her heels. “I’ve had several Jedi and my personal security team check the room, it’s secure. The door is soundproofed and no one but myself knows the entry key. We could insult Palpatine from in here, and no one would ever be the wiser,” Padme reaches up to undo part of the stiff backing for her headdress, knowing she’ll have to ask Gregar or Aavi to fix it before walking the rest of the way home, but not bringing herself to care. Especially not as Aavi also shrugs out of her coat and pulls her gloves off as well. “I’m thinking of resigning,” Aavi says, not meeting Padmé’s eyes. Internally, Padmé’s stomach rolls. The thought of anyone replacing Aavi, even in purely the political sense, makes her extremely concerned. She doesn’t show this, however, employing years of training and careful emotional management to keep her face even. She nods, encouraging Aavi to continue. “I miss my children, Padmé. That’s really all there is to it. I’ve been working ever since Kjii was born, and she’s nearly starting school. My other children don’t remember when I was home, and as much as my wife loves our children, she didn’t sign up to raise them on her own, you know?”Padmé nods again, thinking on this. “This is why you’ve been pushing so much for the hyperspace lanes,” She says, not even a question. Aavi nods tiredly. “I thought that maybe if I had a way to get home faster I could be there more often, but even if I got them to build the lane, it wouldn’t be completed for at least another year. I’m tired, and I’m not as young as I used to be, and I want to go home.” Padmé sighs, nodding in agreement. “I understand, completely. I was waiting until I had more details, or more of a promise, at least, but I’ve been trying to work on getting permission and plans for the lane. If you were to resign, I would be willing to continue to push for it in your absence, with whoever your people choose to replace you. Regardless of a mother’s desire to be with her children, it is entirely unfair that the Senate expects someone at all the sessions while not giving Csilla any kind of travel assurances,” “Thank you, Padmé,” Aavi says, trying to find the words, “I… I’d appreciate that, very much. I’ve discussed with some advisors at home, and we have picked out who my successor would be. She’s very young, and inexperienced, but I think she’ll learn quickly. I didn’t want to ask you, to put that pressure on you, but I’d appreciate if you’d…guide her, in the Senate. In politics. In all the things that you’re skilled at that she won’t understand yet.”Padmé pauses, considering this for a moment. This would be… a big undertaking. She wants to do it, to help Aavi as a friend, and to help Csilla as an ally. Tutoring a new Senator is a big undertaking, though. It’s also proof of trust, of an alliance. For Aavi to ask as a friend for Padmé to watch over a young senator is one thing, but for Senator Ioka to ask as representative of Csilla, for Senator Amidala to train Csilla’s inexperienced and young new representative is entirely another. It would be a statement, and it would be significant. The gossip rings would go out of control with this. There’s already been enough commentary on Padmé apparently being in an affair with Aavi (much to the surprise of Aavi’s wife, as well as Anakin, Padmé, and Aavi. It was funny, admittedly) and if it got out that Padmé was doing this, they’d probably get worse. But this… is a favor for a friend. And Padmé has far too few of those right now. “What’s her name?” “Her Chiss name is Ina’Irv’Errylu. Were she to proceed with plans to be my successor, she would take up her Core name— Airve— and either Ioka, or Errylu as her Senate name. We’ve been weighing the benefits of having her become the third ‘Senator Ioka’ or forging a new path.” Aavi’s aunt had also been a senator, acting under her house name, Ioka, and Aavi hadn’t felt any reason to pick a name besides Ioka to act under. Another unfortunate bit of the xenophobia in the Senate that the Chiss don’t feel comfortable working under their given names, but there’s only so many swamp rats you can stomp in a day. “I figured that you would be able to give opinions on it, regardless of if you chose to guide her.” Padmé nods, thinking. “I’d like to meet her before we decide what name she would use, because the name will be a statement.” She thinks back to picking the name Amidala. To discarding Naberrie like a shedded skin. By asking such a simple question, Aavi has accidentally involved Padmé in the situation by default. “How old is she?” The next question that comes to mind. “She’s fifteen, in Csilla rotations. Making her about seventeen in standard rotations, I believe.”“That young?”“She’s always been older than her peers, but we consider most people adults after they turn ten and are accepted by their house, which she has been. Will it be an issue?” “Legally, no. If she were to come, I’d highly advise a strong guard. Larger than yours, for certain. Even if she is as mature as you say, and isn’t as naive as people will expect, they will expect her to be young, and vulnerable. They’ll see her as an easy target.” Padmé’s mind is already racing, thinking of all her assassination attempts and how many times her decoys saved her life and wondering if she needs to set up this girl with decoys as well and how would we do that and is it even possible, really? “Are you going to guide her, Padmé?” Aavi asks, almost hopefully. Padmé bites her lip, considering this. “I want to meet her before I agree to anything. We have several weeks before the next mandatory session— how long does it take to get to Csilla and back?” “If we have the right ozyly-esehembos— sky-walkers— less than four days. Less than that if we get lucky, but not longer than a week if we don’t.” “I can spare two weeks to travel to meet her, but we’d need to move quickly. I’ll have to meet with my team to prepare, but the soonest I’d expect to leave would be three days from now,” Padmé intentionally ignores how upset Anakin is going to be about her traveling through half the unknown regions and to Csilla, let alone how annoyed Palpatine will be about it. “If you’re serious about this, Aavi, send word to have her begin preparing designs for a wardrobe and her political dissertation for her introductions.” “I’ll contact her tonight,” Aavi stands, looking ever inch the determined Chiss Senator she is. Padmé slips her feet back into her shoes and stands as well. “Thank you— so much, Padmé.” “Don’t thank me yet. I’ll do what I can, but we have very little time and we need to be careful about this. Let it get around that you’re planning on taking a trip home, say something about a wedding or some kind of meeting you need to attend. I need to get there and back without anyone realizing that I was helping you prepare a new Senator, or—”“Or you’ll get audited for biased consults by every side, yes. Regardless of how this goes, Thank you, Padmé. I’ve missed my family.”“Don’t think you’re off the hook about that— I still need to meet this mysterious wife you keep mentioning,” Padmé teases, hand on the door. “Oh, can you help me with this strap?” She turns around, showing Aavi the snaps for the back of her headdress. Aavi makes quick work of the half-dozen of them, patting Padmé on the back and draping her own coat around her shoulders again. Padmé opens the door, stepping back to let Aavi exit first. “Senator Ioka.”“Thank you,” Aavi steps past her and back into the waiting room, all guards springing back to attention. “This was very insightful, Senator Amidala. I appreciate your insight. I’ll send you the records you requested later tonight or tomorrow, and they should have all the necessary details.” “Don’t rush yourself too much, Senator. You’ll be of no use to anyone if you haven’t slept,” Padmé teases, locking the door behind them and gesturing to Gregar to hold the next one for both herself and Aavi. Once in the hallway, Aavi turns and mock-kisses Padmé again, whispering another ‘thank you’, before turning with her attending and heading down the hall. “Gregar,” Padmé says quietly, turning in the opposite direction towards her own rooms. “Would you please schedule a guard shift for outside my room tonight? And Threepio, send an urgent message to Rabé, telling her I need to call her tonight. Privately.”She receives a ‘yes, ma’am,’ from Threepio and a ‘yes, sir,’ from Gregar, takes her datapad from Gregar’s hands, and begins planning before Aavi’s echoing footsteps have entirely disappeared from the corridor.

Chapter Text
“Threepio, prep an invite for Sabé as well, I have a project I need her assistance on. Say that I would appreciate her assistance for about two weeks, and to holo me for more details,” Padmé runs through the list of the others in her head. She’s already requested Rabé, Dormé is here, as is Cordé. Eirtaé is likely available, but she is least valuable as a decoy. The temptation to ask all of them to come is mounting, even just for Padmé’s personal pleasure. “Would you like me to request Yané as well, Senator?” Threepio asks, beating even Padmé to the thought. “Why don’t you, Threepio. Address it to Yané and Saché, I’ll look it all over tomorrow before contacting them.” “Of course, anything else, Padmé?” The group pauses outside of the entrance to Padmé’s personal rooms as Gregar opens the door. “Um… Not tonight, Threepio. You’re off duty. Go power off for the night, and I’ll wake you tomorrow,” Padmé nods, making the decision only as she speaks. Threepio keeps all of her secrets as well as any handmaiden, but there is something to be said for privacy. The droid brushes past her to go find his docking station, and Gregar lightly grabs her elbow. “Is there anything I should know as of now, your- Senator.” Padmé notices the catch, even she sometimes still forgets that while she is Amidala, she’s not Queen Amidala. She also takes the question as it is— a reminder that Padmé is not the best at remembering to share information. “As of yet, all that is decided is that I, and some others, shall be taking a trip. Off-world. A… diplomatic outreach program. We can discuss details tomorrow, once I have more of them to share, but go ahead and start putting together a guard.” Padmé isn’t going to give any crucial information in an open hall, and Gregar knows this. “But sleep first. As I told Senator Ioka, you’re no good to me if you haven’t slept.”“Yes, sir,” Gregar offers a half-salute as he leaves, passing the night’s posted guard on his way. The replacement guard is a strong-looking woman, wearing the same uniform as Gregar, excellently tailored to show her broad shoulders and the way that muscle lines her body. If this were not Padmé’s own guard, she would feel the slightest bit scared. “I’m here to stand watch for the night, Senator,” She salutes, planting herself next to the door. Padmé quickly looks for a nametag, finds none, and instead settles on the rank insignia on her shoulder. “Thank you, Sergeant,” Padmé nods. “I’m sorry for the short notice, as well, but something has come up and I don’t know if I’ll need to leave my rooms tonight or not.”“It’s of no concern, sir, this is my job. I’ll be trading off at 09 tomorrow morning with the Captain, per usual, and will be here if you have use of me. Enjoy your evening, sir.”Padmé nods her thanks, retreating into her rooms. She barely has the door latched when that… nagging voice comes up behind her.“Where were you, Padmé?”Padmé grinds her jaw before turning around, hands clenched into fists. “I was working, Anakin. You know, as a Senator. I was at a meeting. Of the Senate,” She brushes past him, ignoring Anakin towering over her, and goes to find Dormé to help her get out of her dress. “The session closed more than an hour ago, and don’t tell me you were just walking again,” He snaps, soft bootsteps following her through the apartment. “Does it matter what I was doing, Ani? What does it change? I am a Senator, I was doing Senate things, I am back now, and I would really like to get out of this dress,” Padmé finds Dormé, waiting quietly in Padmé’s dressing room, reading something on a datapad. She springs to her feet, knowing better than to interrupt while Anakin is arguing with Padmé, and begins helping Padmé get out of her dress. “I just want to know where you were, Padmé, what if something happened? What if you got hurt, and I didn’t know where you were or where to start looking for you?” Even through the argument, he steps forward to help Dormé lift the headdress off Padmé. (They learned early on that it’s easier-removed by someone taller than Padmé, and Dormé is the same height as she is)“Nothing happened, though, Anakin. I was with Gregar and Threepio, and I went from the chamber to my office to here. And even if I was somewhere else, I would have been fine. It’s not as if there aren’t a million safety measures in place,” Padmé nearly collapses with relief as layers begin being peeled off, Dormé’s nimble fingers working quickly to release her from the dress. Anyone who’s been dressed as Amidala knows how badly you want to get out of the dress after as many hours as Padmé’s been in it. “You know what I mean, though! And you’re avoiding the question.”“It’s really not your business, Anakin,” Padmé snaps, finally having full movement of her neck and the ability to glare up at him. All three of them freeze at her outburst, waiting for someone to come running in and scold them all. Padmé sighs, rubbing a hand over her cheek. “Dormé, why don’t you go to bed. I’m sure that Knight Skywalker can release me from my skirts. Tomorrow we are going to have private meetings, though, so I’ll need help prepping another dress most likely.”“Something casual?” Dormé asks, sparing a skeptical glance at Anakin, who is frankly, towering over both of them. “We’ll be calling home, and possibly running some errands. Not the whole getup, but probably something with a cape. Maybe that one suit?” Padmé starts unhooking jewelry.“I would say the sugar dress, but we can discuss in the morning. I’m sure you’re exhausted after how long that session ran,” Dormé says, almost passively, leaving the dressing room to go to her adjoined rooms. She’s never been one to pick a fight, something that is coming in surprisingly helpful these days. As much as she’s sure Dormé would win, Padmé doesn’t really want to have to break up a fight between a Jedi and one of her handmaidens. The sound of Dormé’s door latching echoes throughout the apartment, and a hush falls over Anakin and Padmé as she continues removing jewerly. Layers and layers of it, not to mention her hands are still shaking from not having eaten. “Ami,” Anakin says quietly, stepping over to help her with her necklace. A nickname that sprung up long ago, for the Queen Amidala he first met, and a response for the teasing ‘Ani’ she used to call him all the time. Padmé drops her hands and tilts her head down so that he can reach the clasps easier, metallic fingers brushing against her neck. “I’m sorry I yelled,” She forces the words out, like they hurt her to say, and he moves from necklaces to hairpins. “You’re right. It’s not my business. I’m sorry. I just… I worry. I don’t know what I’d do if something happened to you.” “We have security measures for that kind of thing set up,” Padmé reminds him. He pulls her back towards his chest after most of her hair tumbles loose. Padmé fixes her eyes on the last bit of fading sunlight she can see against the horizon. “I know. I’m sorry. I just got worried, especially after I had asked Threepio to tell you I was stopping by tonight, I thought you’d be coming straight back. I’m sorry.” Padmé sighs, tilting her head back. It’s okay, she wants to say, on reflex. It’s not okay, and it’s getting on her nerves, but there’s too many things happening to get into another big argument tonight. It’s already late, and sleep needs to happen at some point tonight. “I was meeting with Aavi,” She says, because what else is there to say? “She’s retiring, and asked if I’d help train her replacement. I’m going to travel back to Csilla with her to meet the new Senator, probably with Cordé, Dormé, Saché, and Sabé, and maybe with Eirtaé, Rabé, and Yané.” “Csilla?” Anakin says, tensing against her back. “The Csilla that’s in the unknown regions?” “Yes,” Padmé replies, knowing what’s coming. “You can’t go there by yourself.”“I’m not, Anakin, I told you. I’m taking at least four handmaidens and a full guard with me.”“That doesn’t count, Padmé. You don’t know the Chiss like I do.” “No, but I know Aavi like you don’t. I know what I’m doing, Anakin. That’s why I’m bringing as many handmaidens as I can get ahold of. It’ll be a two week trip at most, and I’ll have a decoy whenever I’m not behind closed doors. Per usual. Not to mention Captain Typho and his entire hand-picked guard. I won’t be undefended, Ani,” She untangles herself slightly, turning around to look at him. He looks tired. “Why did you come tonight, Anakin?” “Obi-Wan,” He replies, settling his face back into Padmé’s hair. He doesn’t need to say more. Obi-Wan has been pushing for Anakin to… get his act together, for lack of better phrase. To fill the seat on the Council he’s already sitting in. To stop acting like a Padawan and start acting like a Knight. To train Ahsoka like he’s supposed to be. Padmé adds yet another note, to try and catch Ahsoka for tea sometime soon. Probably after the trip. Maybe further off than that. But it should happen soon. Obi-Wan’s pushing Anakin to grow up, and Anakin doesn’t like it. He feels like Obi-Wan is trying to change who he is, trying to wring the last bits of anything that isn’t ruthless efficiency out of him, and Obi-Wan is just trying to get Anakin to take the war seriously for once. They’re two sides of the same coin, just trying to get through another day, and Padmé has spent too much of her day negotiating to keep doing it right now. “Let me change into something more comfortable, and then we can eat and go to bed, alright?” She says against Anakin’s chest. With some hesitation, he peels them apart. “Alright. Should I cook something, or do you just want to make a nutrient pack?” Even as he offers the option, his nose wrinkles, making Padmé laugh. “They’re really not that bad, you just have to…not think about what you’re eating?” “That is missing the whole point of food, Padmé,” Anakin shakes his head, going towards the kitchen either way. Padmé starts peeling off the rest of her dress— Dormé had undone it so that Padmé could take it off when she was ready. A good decision, seeing as generally it’s significantly harder to feel dignified in an argument when you’re standing in your underwear. Padmé adds another note to find a gift for Dormé soon, maybe even while they’re on the trip to Csilla, as a sign of appreciation.

Dormé is the only handmaiden that is living with Padmé, the only one who sees Padmé every day, and by extension one of very few who gets the responsibility of knowing everything that Padmé is doing. She signed up to guard a queen, and years later is doing everything that a Senator could ever ask. And Padmé appreciates it. She just doesn’t… say so enough. Dormé and Padmé are less friends as they are efficient coworkers. They get along very, very well. And work together very, very well. There’s not really any roadblocks to them being friends, it just never happened. Padmé doesn’t think that this is a problem, that it’s better to have many friendly associates than to associate with many friends— that it’s better for everyone, emotionally, with the risk of this job. Sometimes, she doesn’t know if Queen Amidala or Senator Amidala is the one consistently in the most danger. Dormé says that she thinks Senator Amidala is in more danger because of the amount of people she has access to (the amount of people she is able to anger) in a day. Cordé thinks that Queen Amidala was in the most danger because she was young, and an integral figurehead in Naboo. Kill Queen Amidala, the planet would descend into chaos. Kill Senator Amidala, they’d just hire a replacement. Padmé appreciates the kind of ruthless efficiency that Cordé thinks with. And she agrees, on some level. Even now she knows that Queen Réillata wouldn’t mourn for very long before selecting someone new. Again, the ruthless efficiency that is helpful for this kind of job. Padmé would rather have no one at her funeral than have her death interrupt the proceedings of the galaxy. Sabé knows this. She doesn’t agree, but she knows this. Padmé thinks that it’s probably part of why they work together so well. Padmé would sacrifice herself for any cause that was ‘good enough’, and Sabé makes sure that the ‘good enough’ really is good enough. They argue about that a lot. Padmé argues with a lot of people a lot. After pulling on the first pajamas she could find, Padmé goes to join Anakin in the kitchen. She can tell from the set of his shoulders that he’s thinking very, very hard about something. He seems focused on the food, however. Cooking is generally a good distraction for him when he starts to get stressed, so Padmé’s glad that she decided it was worth the trouble to eat before going to bed. Even though she walks quietly, and he doesn’t look up, Padmé knows that he knows she’s there. He takes a breath, stirring whatever is in the pot he’s working with. “I’d like to send a Jedi with you,” He says, carefully. Measured words, trying to phrase things just how he wants, and to do it without getting angry again. “To Csilla. Not because I don’t trust the Chiss, or Senator Ioka, but because Csilla is very far away, and the Chiss are the only people who really know how to get there.” Padmé considers this for a moment. “Just a Jedi?”“My first thought was that I could go with you, but I don’t think that anyone would find that to be an enjoyable trip, and I’m not diplomatic enough for somewhere like Csilla,” Padmé nods, even though he can’t see her. The Chiss are not war-mongering, but they’re as much in favor of an earned war as the Separatists are. Half the planet is a registered soldier. Anakin would pick too many fights, and cause another incident. He’s not diplomatic enough for Csilla, exactly as he said. Padmé chews on the corner of her mouth again, a half smile growing as she comes to sit at the small table. “My second thought was that I’d send Myrii, but—” “Yeah,” Padmé cuts him off before that line of discussion goes any further. It never ends well, and it never ends the same way. On some level, everyone still blames themselves for that. Regardless, Padmé would take the information she’s gathered on Myrii’s movements to her grave. It was an impulsive decision to put the order out to watch for her. “So then my next thought was Ahsoka. I know you get along, and she’s better at diplomacy than I am, but I remembered that we’ve already been given orders for another mission,” He’s gesturing with the spoon as he speaks, and Padmé just watches, chin in hand, as he explains what he’s thinking. “The Council wants us to go check out some weird earthquakes on a mining planet, it’s scaring off the workers and we need the imports for weapons manufacturing. I’m supposed to take part of the 501st, and of course Snips absolutely insisted she was going to come too, since she’s ‘my Padawan and that means she’s supposed to follow me all the time and see all the things I do so she can learn’, but it’s really just because Luminara and Bariss are coming and she wants to gossip.” He sets the spoon on the bare counter (Padmé winces, knowing she’ll have to wash that later) and moves to get bowls for each of them. “So then, the obvious solution is Obi-Wan. You’ve worked together before, and it wouldn’t be suspicious for you to ask for him to go with you. He’s also very diplomatic, and probably would love to go to Csilla and stare at their castles or whatever tourist attraction they have. What do you think?” Anakin hands Padmé a bowl, and she nods, thinking about it. She doesn’t really want to be the one to ask for a Jedi escort, she doesn’t want to admit that she needs help, (or rather, that Anakin thinks she does) but it really wouldn’t hurt anything to have Obi-Wan accompany her. She takes her first bite of the food Anakin gave her, forgetting to blow on it, and nearly burning her tongue. Anakin laughs as she quickly swallows and takes a drink of water, carefully blowing on his own  as he starts to eat. “I agree with everything you’ve said. I don’t really want to bring a Jedi escort, but it does make sense, and probably wouldn’t hurt, that far out, as you said. Is Obi-Wan available right now?”“The Council gave him a two-week planetside after that medical station he was helping, which ends in three days or something, and he hasn’t been reassigned yet. Plus, the Council likes you, and they also want another reason to be able to ask you for favors. They’d probably call him back from an active warzone if you really wanted to have him over for dinner.”“Okay, I don’t know if they like me that much,” Padmé says between bites. “But I see your point. Tomorrow, when I start making calls, I’ll talk to the Council and see if they can spare Obi-Wan for my two week diplomatic visit to Csilla.”“Thank you,” Anakin grins at Padmé over his soup, and Padmé is gripped once again by that urge to forget the state of the galaxy. She’s tired of all of this, and distantly jealous of Yané and her peaceful, stationary home full of many children.

Chapter Text

FIRST ILLNESS
Bo-Katan hated being sick.Sick meant vulnerability. Sick meant weakness. Sick meant wasted time.Yet here she was. Sick. Sick and confined to her cabin on Moff Gideon’s commandeered cruiser, which she and Koska had renamed the Whistling Bird. A gentle tap sounded on the door. “Bo-Katan?”“Go away, Djarin,” Bo-Katan ordered, but she sounded less than authoritative even to herself.Silence from the other side of the door. Yet somehow, Bo-Katan was sure the new mand’alor hadn’t gone away.He seemed to have a habit of not going away.The door hissed open and Bo-Katan saw Djarin’s silhouette shadowed on the wall.
Of course.
“Can I come in?” Djarin asked again.What part of ‘go away’ don’t you understand? Bo-Katan wanted to say, but all that came out was a coughing fit.Djarin was kneeling in front her so fast Bo-Katan barely even registered that he’d moved.
Dank farrik, I just want to be left alone!
“Sit up,” Djarin ordered quietly.Bo-Katan forced herself upright. “I’m fine.”Djarin snorted. “Yeah, and I’m the King of Mandalore.” He paused. “Wait, I am the King of Mandalore. You’re still not fine.”Bo-Katan tried to glare.“Here.” Djarin pressed a metal can into her hands and popped it open. “Get some fluid in you. Getting dehydrated is just going to make your fever worse.”“How do you know I have a fever?” Bo-Katan challenged.“A hunch.”Bo-Katan took a sip. The water was bubbly and sweet. “Where did you get this?”“I might have raided the officers’ mess,” Djarin confessed with a mixture of shame and pride. “Come on, keep drinking.”Bo-Katan sniffed. “Are you a nurse now, too?” She took another drink of the water and relished the bubbles on her itchy throat.“I’m full of surprises.”“There are MD units on this ship, you know,” Bo-Katan pointed out.“I don’t trust them,” Djarin said flatly.Bo-Katan eyed the man in front of her. “Cara said you have a thing about droids.”“She’s right.”Bo-Katan waited for Djarin to elaborate. He didn’t.“You seem like the type who wouldn’t go see an MD droid anyway,” Djarin observed.“You—” Bo-Katan sneezed. “You are not incorrect.”“Drink,” Djarin urged. “Come on.”Bo-Katan wrinkled her nose in annoyance. “Koska sent you down here, didn’t she.”“Nope.”Bo-Katan drained the last of her water. “Then what are you doing here?”“A king can’t see to the health of his queen?”Now Bo-Katan really was speechless.“What?” Djarin asked after a few moments. “We’re clan, aren’t we?”“I, well,” Bo-Katan stammered. “Yeah.”Djarin was looking at her like that explained everything.“Is there any more of this in that officers’ mess you raided?” Bo-Katan blurted, holding up the now-empty can. Anything, anything to end this grossly awkward exchange.Djarin nodded once.“Can you get me some?”Djarin rose to his feet. “By your command, Lady Bo-Katan.” He swept out of the room.
Was he trying to be charming?

Well. He’s not.
Bo-Katan fell back on her cot and was asleep again in minutes. When she woke, she saw a text message from Koska on her comm.
What’s all that osik outside your door?
With a grunt, Bo-Katan stumbled to the door and peeked outside. Sure enough, she saw a pallet of cans just like the one Djarin had brought her earlier.The comm chimed with another message.
Did Djarin bring that for you?
Bo-Katan tossed her comm on the bed, grabbed a can, and sat down to drink it.She’d just pretend she never saw the messages if Koska asked later.









Chapter 2: There Was Only One Bed
    


Notes:
*throws open door to Mando fandom*I'M BACK YOU GUYS!!!!! Did you really think I'd abandoned this series? Heck no! I just had a baby, moved, and got sucked big time into Halo. I love this series and will never leave it.I also changed the name of the series, because I never really like the old one.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            




Chapter Text
“Where are you going?”Din bit his tongue. He’d spent his life avoiding detection, flying under the radar literally and figuratively, emerging only long enough to accomplish his mission before sliding back into the shadows.Yet somehow Bo-Katan Kryze always seemed to find him.“I might have a lead on a covert,” Din answered his new clan-mate shortly. He slung his pack over his shoulder and proceeded to the Whistling Bird’s hangar bay.
The door is right here. I almost made it.
“A covert?” Din heard Bo-Katan’s footsteps quicken as she ran to catch up to him. “Hey! You found a covert?”“I might have a lead,” Din corrected without turning around.“You were going to leave without telling me?”“Yes.” In truth, it had never occurred to him to tell her.Bo-Katan fairly leapt to place herself in front of Din. “I’m coming with you.”“No, you aren’t.” Din moved to open the hangar bay door.Bo-Katan’s hand moved at light speed to cover the access panel. “Yes, I am. Were you really going to go find potential allies without me?” Bo-Katan asked.“It’s not that simple,” Din explained. “I have to bring in a bounty for the contact, and then they give us info on the covert.”“I thought you weren’t a bounty hunter anymore.”Yes, so did I. “Old habits die hard.”“I’m still coming with you.”Stars and galaxies, this woman was stubborn. “Do you know how to track a bounty?” Din asked impatiently.“Do you know how to rule a planet?” Bo-Katan returned.“That’s not relevant—”“Yes, it is,” Bo-Katan cut him off. “We agreed to do this together. And you may be a great hunter, but I’m the one who can bring this covert into our cause if they want it.”Din sighed heavily.“Look, Djarin, I know you’re used to working alone. But this isn’t the Bounty Hunters’ Guild. If we’re going to be a team…we need to be a team.”
Why does she have to be right? 
“Fine,” Din relented.Bo-Katan shifted. “Good.”Din inclined his helmeted head to the access panel. “We won’t go anywhere if I can’t open the door.”Bo-Katan glanced to her left. “Oh.”“You’ll need to move your hand,” Din pointed out.“Right.” Bo-Katan jerked her hand away as if the panel were on fire, her fingers batting Din’s in the process.“Thank you.” Din opened the door. “After you, Lady Kryze.”Bo-Katan took a couple of awkward steps back. “I could have opened the door.”“Yes, you could have. Now let’s go.”“Do we have a few minutes?”Din glared at her through his visor. “For what?”“I need to get my helmet.”...“Well. That was a bust,” Bo-Katan declared as she set her helmet on the floor.“Not necessarily,” Djarin countered. “We’ll go back in the morning.”Bo-Katan unclasped her vambraces. “Sven said he didn’t know anything.”“He’s lying.”The simple confidence in the answer made Bo-Katan look up. “What makes you say that?”“I can tell,” Djarin said quietly.“How?”“He grabbed the arm of his chair when I asked if he’d seen our contact.”Bo-Katan furrowed her brow. “And?”“People do that when they lie.”Now Bo-Katan was intrigued. “How do you know that?” She moved to unfasten her boots.“When everyone around you covers their faces, you get very good at reading body language.”Bo-Katan nodded slowly. “I guess you do.”“We’ll go back tomorrow.” Djarin tossed a pillow on the floor. “Start first thing in the morning when we have more time.”“Wait—what are you doing?” Bo-Katan asked.Djarin looked at her through his visor for a moment before answering. “There’s only one bed.”He’s a better politician than he knows, Bo-Katan thought. He’s great at not answering questions. “So?”“I’m not letting you sleep on the floor.”Bo-Katan was momentarily speechless. He just assumed I’d take the bed? “Well, I’m not letting you sleep on the floor.”An uncomfortable pause.Bo-Katan rolled her eyes. “Oh, please, Djarin. We’re adults.”Djarin’s discomfort gave way to confusion. “Yes, we are.”“We can sleep in the same bed.”Discomfort again. “Are you….”“The bed is big enough,” Bo-Katan said.Djarin eyed the bed in question. “It’s really not.”“You’re not sleeping on the floor, Lord Mand’alor. That’s an order from your queen.”“I thought you were a queen consort and didn’t have any authority.”Nothing gets by him, Bo-Katan thought with grudging admiration. “Fine, it’s a plea from your clan-mate who doesn’t want you to sleep on the floor.”Djarin removed his helmet. He did that when he wanted to make a point, Bo-Katan had noticed. “One condition.”Bo-Katan raised her eyebrows.“You have to start calling me by name.”Something in Bo-Katan hesitated. That was a personal boundary she just didn’t feel ready to cross.
You’re clan. You’re about to sleep in the same bed with him. Is using his first name really too much?
A part of her felt like it was.“All right,” Bo-Katan sounded more flustered than she would ever care to admit. “Din, I’m not letting you sleep on the floor.”Din unclasped his breastplate. “Very well, Lady Bo-Katan.”Bo-Katan could have made a crack that if she had to use his first name, he couldn’t use her royal title. But this whole situation was already weird enough.The unlikely royals stripped out of their armor in tense silence. When she was down to her base layer, Bo-Katan laid down on the bed. A few minutes later she felt the mattress shift as Djarin—Din. His name is Din—settled in next to her.He was right. The bed isn’t big enough. Bo-Katan shifted as close to the edge as she could possibly get. I should have taken the floor.The bed moved again.Don’t try anything. I know how to defend myself, Bo-Katan thought but didn’t say. It wasn’t like Din didn’t already know that.Truthfully, she didn’t think he was the sort to try anything, anyway.The mattress shifted again. Din sighed heavily.Bo-Katan risked a glance over her shoulder in the dark room. “Keep that up and I will make you take the floor.” She wouldn’t, but it felt good to say for some reason.“The bed’s too soft,” Din mumbled.Some of Bo-Katan’s irritation turned to empathy. “I know.”A long pause. Then, “Happens to you, too?”“When I was with Death Watch, and during the Purge, I used to sleep on the ground and use my jetpack as a pillow.” Bo-Katan turned onto her back. “I would long for the days in Sundari Palace when I had an actual bed, but now whenever I get to sleep on one—”“You feel like there’s nothing under you,” Din interrupted quietly.Bo-Katan swallowed. “Yeah.”“My cabin on the Razor Crest was tiny,” Din said. “Barely enough room to sleep. I got so used to it that now anything else feels too big.”“Like anything could sneak up on you?” Bo-Katan ventured.“I guess.”Oh, why not. We’re making awkward confessions anyway. “You ever wake up and have no idea where you are?” Bo-Katan asked before she could talk herself out of it.Din gave a long sigh. “All the time.”“What do you do?” Bo-Katan’s voice was softer than she’d meant it to be.“When Grogu was with me, he used to jump out of his hammock and sit on my chest until I came out of it.""Bo-Katan smiled a little at the image.“What do you do?” Din asked.“Just…run through a list of all the places where I could be waking up,” Bo-Katan said.They were silent for awhile. Then Din spoke up. “You sure you don’t want me to take the floor?”“What kind of queen makes her king sleep on the floor?” Bo-Katan asked, half-joking.
The kind who is only in this for political gain.
Bo-Katan was that kind of queen.Wasn’t she?Din rolled to face the wall. “Well, offer’s open if you decide you’re that kind of queen.”“I’m not,” Bo-Katan said.Surprisingly to herself, she meant it.




Notes:

The conversation about the bed being too soft is a nod to Steve and Sam's dialogue at the beginning of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Because what good is fanfic if you can't do a few fandom cross-references?










Chapter 3: Haircut
    


Notes:
I lost almost all of my WIPs while setting up my desktop after our move, but this is one of the few I didn't lose. Decided to share it with the world now because I am going to be a VERY long time reconstructing all my ideas for this series from scratch.Before Mr jumps in the comments with this: Always save your files to the Cloud, kids.




Chapter Text
“Get those away from my head.”Bo-Katan glared at the man across from her. “They’re scissors, Din.”“I know what they are. Get them away from my head.”“You need a haircut.”“No, I don’t.”“Yes, you do.”“Why do I need a haircut?”“Because you’re the fekking King of Mandalore, that’s why,” Bo-Katan snapped in irritation. “And you can’t go around looking like Mr. Magoo cut your hair.”The blank look on Din’s face plainly said that he had no idea what she was talking about.“Mr. Magoo?” Bo-Katan asked. “The kids’ holodrama?” When that elicited no response, she added: “About the blind guy?”Din shrugged cluelessly.Bo-Katan dropped her hands to her sides. “Do you live under a rock?”“Did that sound better in your head?” Din inquired wryly.Bo-Katan was not here to engage in a battle of wits. “The more you argue, the longer I’m going to keep you barricaded in here.”“I’m good at waiting.”Bo-Katan took a long breath. “Listen, I promise I’m not going to slice your carotid artery, all right? We just need to do something about that mop on your head.”Din gave a faux-offended look that was almost charming.“I won’t take long,” Bo-Katan promised.Din was silent for a moment, and then puffed a small sigh. “Fine.”Bo-Katan couldn’t help a tiny, triumphant smile. “Thank you.” She pulled a chair in front of Din. “Hold still.”Din didn’t say anything. Bo-Katan gently parted his dark hair down the middle, trying to get a sense of what she was working with.Din tensed at the touch.“Hey, I already promised not to slice your throat,” Bo-Katan said, trying to lighten the mood. She worked her fingers though a stubborn knot. “Have you ever heard of a comb?”“I live under a rock, remember?”Bo-Katan wrinkled her nose at the tangled, uneven mess on Din’s head. “Seriously. Who cut your hair? Grogu?”“I did,” Din said as if it were obvious.“With what?”“Ahsoka’s laser swords.”Bo-Katan pulled her head back to give Din a look that said she didn’t appreciate his sarcasm.Because she didn’t appreciate it. It wasn’t funny.“Hair isn’t much of a consideration when you live under a helmet,” Din pointed out.Bo-Katan paused. “All right, point taken.” She combed a lock of hair over his forehead and snipped off the ends.Din jumped.“If you keep jumping like that I might nick your carotid artery by accident.” Satisfied with her work, Bo-Katan moved to the side of his head.“Sorry,” Din apologized. “It’s been awhile.”“Awhile since—” Bo-Katan froze in realization. “Oh. Oh. I—”“It’s fine,” Djarin cut her off. “Just get on with it.”“Let me know if….” I’m making you uncomfortable? Getting too close?
This is probably the closest anyone’s ever been to him since he was a kid.
Bo-Katan pushed the thought away. She was cutting Din’s hair. That was all.“It’s OK.” Din sounded a little more relaxed now.Not knowing what to say, Bo-Katan continued working. She was no hairdresser, but she could hardly do worse than Din had done himself.Hurry up. Make it quick, Bo-Katan found herself thinking.The closeness was downright stifling.“Keep your head still,” Bo-Katan instructed. “I know it’s hard.”“Yeah,” Djarin said in a whisper.Something twisted in Bo-Katan’s gut.
Just keep going.
Bo-Katan deftly combed, snipped, and arranged Din’s hair until it was…not perfect, but at least passable.“There.” With a satisfied smile, the heiress held up a mirror. “What do you think?”Din studied his reflection impassively. “I look the same.”“Oh, for stars’ sakes.” Bo-Katan let the mirror fall to her side and put a hand on her hip. “You do not.”Din looked at himself for another beat. “Yeah, I do.”Bo-Katan held back the urge to swat him. “Are you saying my hairdressing skills are no better than a blind cartoon character?”Din’s eyes widened a little. “I’m saying whatever’s not going to get me killed.”“Relax, Watch-Child, you’re the one with the Darksaber, remember?”“Yes, despite my best efforts, I can’t forget.”Bo-Katan let out a surprised huff of laughter.“What?” Din asked.Bo-Katan eyed him. “That was funny.”Din seemed mildly confused. “Oh,” was all he said.He might be funny now and then, Bo-Katan thought, but if we’re going to make any new allies we need to work on his negotiating.But at least, Bo-Katan mused, the unlikely mand’alor would have a good haircut.









Chapter 4: I Wanna Hold Your Hand
    


Notes:
Coming up from my Halo hole to throw a bone at my Mando readers :). Hoping to have something more substantive for these two soon! Reconstructing everything from the ground up is a chore.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            




Chapter Text
Din hadn’t made it as a bounty hunter by giving in to panic.That didn’t mean he never wanted to. And when a cadre of deathtroopers happened upon his hideout, he wanted to.
Control your breath. Focus on what you can do. Not panicking doesn’t guarantee survival, but panicking just about guarantees you’ll get killed.
With a minimum of motion, Din looked to his left to observe Bo-Katan. She was sitting next to him, using the massive tree root for as much cover as they could get.Good. She doesn’t panic, either. Not that he’d thought she would.Din sat still as death and listened. He heard the troopers’ heavy footfalls, armor clacking, weapons moving.“Nothing here. Let’s move out,” one of them said.Yes, good idea. Move out. Din’s knees were starting to hurt. Once upon a time he could have stayed in this position for hours. Now his body was protesting after only a few minutes.Din waited until he determined there had been silence for long enough. He looked at Bo-Katan. She nodded once.Slowly, the two Mandalorians made their way from their hideout. Bo-Katan emerged first, scanning the area for threats. Din looked behind them.“Nothing,” he said under his breath.“Same,” Bo-Katan returned.“Let’s get back to the ship.” Din straightened fully and started in Bo-Katan’s direction.“Agreed.”Din stepped on what looked like a solid foothold, only to find it was a rock barely held in place by dirt and leaves. The stone fell, taking Din and his creaking knees with it.“Din!” Bo-Katan turned to grab his arm.Din looked over her shoulder. A single trooper in the distance turned in their direction.“Get down!” Din hissed, pulling Bo-Katan back under the root with him. They pressed against the dirt behind them, folding into themselves as best they could.Din heard the trooper step directly over their shelter, barely a foot above their heads. He braced himself for a fight.Some distant part of his mind felt Bo-Katan squeezing his hand.But the trooper left as quickly as he’d come.Din sighed in relief.“Maybe now we can get to the ship?” Bo-Katan’s voice sounded shaky.“Yeah,” Din agreed. “Let’s go.”It wasn’t until they both tried to move from their hideaway that Din realized Bo-Katan still hadn’t released his hand.And it wasn’t until she needed her hand to unholster her pistol, that he realized he didn’t want her to.




Notes:

If anyone is curious, I used the scene where the hobbits are hiding from the Black Riders in Fellowship of The Ring for inspiration here.










Chapter 5: Start Again
    


Summary:

“But where do we start?” Bo-Katan implored. “We wanted to join forces and…” she looked down, then up. “There’s nothing left to join.”“We make something to join.”



Notes:
Yo, I'm back after another long hiatus. Hoping this season will give my muse a boost! I've really been languishing on this series since most of my WIPs and ideas got lost in my computer crash.This is taken from the scene on Kalevala in S3E01.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            




Chapter Text
“There’s nothing left.”Din looked around the desolate structure and shared Bo-Katan’s sentiment.They’d been told there was a Mandalorian contingent on Kalevala. They’d arrived to find nothing but an empty, ruined castle. In the absence of a leader, Mandalorians had done what they did best: split into factions and eat their own.“There’s just…” Bo-Katan sat on what must have been a throne, once. It was a sad parody of her station. “It’s all gone.” She set her helmet on the ground and put her head in her hands.Din was not one to dwell on the present when the future demanded attention. “Where should we go next?”Bo-Katan looked at him like he was crazy. “Have you even been here the past half hour?”“Yes,” Din said curtly. “What’s our next move?”“There is no next move!”“There’s always a next move,” Din insisted.Bo-Katan shook her head.“Hey.” Din took his helmet off and took a step toward his companion. “This Darksaber, reuniting Mandalore, me being the king of Mandalore, retaking the planet, us being clan? All of this, it was your idea.”“So what?” Bo-Katan bit.“So, you don’t get to jump ship now!”“I’m not jumping ship.” Bo-Katan walked to the edge of the overhang and looked out at the ocean. “There’s no ship to jump.”I can’t believe I’m doing this. Din sighed to himself and marched over to join her. “No.”Bo-Katan looked over her shoulder. “Excuse me?”“No!” Din repeated. “I can’t do this without you. You said that yourself!”“You don’t need me. You have the Darksaber,” Bo-Katan said bitterly.I really can’t believe I’m doing this. “Wanna fight me for it?”That got Bo-Katan’s attention. “What?” She turned to face him.“Do you want to fight me for the Darksaber?”“If I wanted to do that, I would have done it long before now.”“Great,” Din said flatly. “Then I’m still Mand’alor. And I need your help.”“I already said, you don’t need me. Pull out the Darksaber and whatever Mandalorians you can find will do anything you want.” Bo-Katan sat on a step and propped her chin on one hand.She was stubborn, Din would give her that. This was going to be harder than he thought. “That’s not what I want.”Bo-Katan turned a baleful look on him. “What do you want, Lord Mand’alor?”Din tapped the Darksaber’s hilt. “I want someone else to have this thing. But since I can’t seem to get rid of it, I want to…” he trailed off. “If I have to be the king of Mandalore, I want to be a good king of Mandalore. And I need your help.”For a few seconds Bo-Katan just looked at him. Then, “You’re disgustingly noble, you know that?”Din blinked twice. “Thank you?”Bo-Katan looked back at the water. “I’m not sure what good I am to you,” she said. “I wasn’t much of a ruler.”“You were good enough to get our people to follow you all the way to the Purge,” Din pointed out. “If Gideon had never taken the saber from you, you’d still be ruler.” He stepped toward her. “Hey, I don’t know what I’m doing here, all right? You may not have been had the saber long, but you did have it. You know more than I do.”“But where do we start?” Bo-Katan implored. “We wanted to join forces and…” she looked down, then up. “There’s nothing left to join.”“We make something to join.” Din offered his hand. Bo-Katan looked at him blankly for a moment, then grasped his forearm and stood.“All right, Lord Mand’alor,” Bo-Katan said with an almost-smile. “Let’s make something.”
